We have concealed it between chapters one and two so that it will not meet any eye but yours.</p><p>We have a confession to make--it would be useless to attempt concealment--we have the Digression habit.</p><p>We have tried every known remedy but we fear it is incurable.</p><p>All we ask, Gentle Reader, is that when we stray too far you will favour us with a gentle reminder.</p><p>CHAPTER II</p><p>A LONG JUMP</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p>It is a long jump from Moses, the author of the first work on Geography, to Peter Simple.</p><p>When the acrobatic reader has fetched his breath and looks back at the fearsome list of Geographers he has skipped--Strabo, Anaximander, Hecatoeus, Demoeritus, Eudoxus, Ephorus, Dicoearchus, Erastothenes, Polybius, Posidonius and Charles F. King,--he may well be thankful to find he has fallen upon his feet.</p><p>The Geographer&#39;s task is endless.</p><p>The Planet he endeavours to portray is perpetually changing its appearance. After thousands and thousands of years, it is no nearer completion than it was in the beginning.</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p>The Sea with its white teeth bites the edges of the continents into new shapes, as a child bites the edges of a biscuit. The glaciers file away the mountains into valleys and plains. Beneath the ocean busy insects are building the foundations of new continents and, under the earth, Fiery Demons are ready at all times to burst forth and help to destroy the old ones.</p><p>It really begins to look as if this Planet would never be finished.</p><p>In the first chapter of his geography, Moses tells us there were only two people in the world.</p><p>Today we are preparing to put up the &quot;standing room only&quot; notice. In another thousand years, for aught we know, the earth may be going round dark and tenantless and bearing the sign &quot;To Let.&quot; What does it matter to us? What are we but microscopic weevils in the mouldy crust of earth? Sufficient unto the day is the weevil thereof.</p><p>CHAPTER III</p><p>THE GIDDY GLOBE</p><p>Men of Science, who delight in applying harsh terms to things that cannot talk back, have called this Giddy Globe an Oblate Spheroid.</p><p>Francis Bacon called it a Bubble; Shakespeare, an Oyster; Rossetti, a Midge; and W. S. Gilbert addresses it familiarly as a Ball--</p><pre><code>_Roll on, thou ball, roll on!_
_Through pathless realms of Space_
      _Roll on!_
_What though I&#39;m in a sorry case?_
_What though I cannot meet my bills?_
_What though I suffer toothache&#39;s ills?_
_What though I swallow countless pills?_
      _Never you mind_
      _Roll on!_
            (_It rolls on._)
</code></pre><p>But these people belong to a privileged class that is encouraged (even paid) to distort the language, and they must not be taken too literally.</p><p>The Giddy Globe is really quite large, not to say obese.</p><p>Her waist measurement is no less than twenty-five thousand miles. In the hope of reducing it, the earth takes unceasing and violent exercise, but though she spins round on one toe at the rate of a thousand miles an hour every day, and round the sun once a year, she does not succeed in taking off a single mile or keeping even comfortably warm all over.</p><p>No wonder the globe is giddy!</p><p><em>QUESTIONS</em></p><p><em>Explain the Nebular Hypothesis.</em></p><p><em>State briefly the electromagnetical constituents of the Aurora Borealis, and explain their relation to the Hertzian Waves.</em></p><p><em>Define the difference between the Hertzian Wave and the Marcel Wave.</em></p><p>CHAPTER IV</p><p>THE USE OF THE GLOBE</p><p>What is the Earth for? Nobody knows. Some say the Earth was made to supply the wants of Man, but as Man is part and parcel of the Earth herself, dust of her dust, mould of her mould, it does not answer the question.</p><p>[Illustration: THE FRIENDLY COW. From an instantaneous photograph of animal cracker.</p><p>Owing to the high price of living the cow was partially eaten by the author before the photograph could be taken.]</p><p>To be sure the Earth produces the Tobacco Plant, and many other things that we classify among the needs of Man, including the &quot;Friendly Cow&quot;--</p><pre><code>_She walks among the flowers sweet_
  _And chews and chews and chews,_
_And turns them into friendly meat,_
  _And pleasant boots and shoes._
</code></pre><p>But the &quot;Friendly Cow&quot; may in her secret heart regard the classification as anything but friendly. For all we know, in the hidden scheme of Creation, the Cow may herself be the subject for ultimate evolution into the Perfect Being, and Man (to reverse Darwin), descending through the Ape to ever lower planes, only a discarded experiment.</p><p>And the Tobacco Plant? In the course of time there may be no Tobacco Plant.</p><p>Should the American People be again tempted to wage a World War for Freedom, they may find on their return that the Tobacco Plants have gone to join the Grape Vines of California!</p><p>Our only hope will then be that smoking is permitted in Hea----*</p><pre><code>                                     * The Author _is_ digressing.

Poised on an imaginary toe, she pirouettes round her self-centre, at the rate of over a thousand miles an hour.</p><p>We say imaginary toe because the Earth, owing to the enormous size of her waist, has never been able to see it.</p><p>To anyone with a waist measurement of twenty-five thousand miles the very existence of toes is purely problematical.</p><p>To wear an actual belt round a waist of such dimensions would be impossible even if it could be of any use. Instead, therefore, the Earth wears round her middle an imaginary line called the Equator.</p><p>To give this imaginary belt some excuse for existence we have depicted the Earth in an imaginary ballet skirt, which without in any way hampering her movements complies with the strict regulations pertaining to feminine attire.</p><p>Being self-centred, the Earth has naturally an exaggerated sense of self-esteem.</p><p>Other Spheres of equal or greater importance are referred to as &quot;Luminaries&quot; and supposed to exist chiefly for the purpose of furnishing light when the Sun and Moon are otherwise engaged.</p><pre><code>_Oh would some Power the giftie gie her_

The only apparent reason for its existence is to hold up the Upper Crust.</p><p>To quote the eminent Nonsensologist Gelett Burgess--</p><pre><code>_The Upper Crust is light as snow_
  _And gay with sugar-rime;_
_The Under Crust must stay below,_
  _It has a horrid time._
</code></pre><p>When in the course of time the Upper Crust becomes too rich and heavy for the popular taste, the Social Pie flops over and the Under Crust becomes the Upper Crust.</p><p>These periodic flip-flops of the Social Pie are called Revolutions.</p><p>You would think that a Revolving Pie would be a disturbing thing to have in one&#39;s system, but the Giddy Globe doesn&#39;t seem to mind it in the least.</p><p>Balanced on an imaginary toe, she continues to pirouette at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, just as if nothing were the matter.</p><p>The latest specimen of Acrobatic Pastry is after a Russian recipe.</p><p>The Bolshevik Pie has no Upper Crust at all and is declared by the leading Chefs of Europe to be unfit for human consumption, but the proof of the Pie is in the eating, how would you like to try just a----*</p><pre><code>                                       * Take it away, or we won&#39;t

 As through the needle&#39;s eye to crawl,
 Rich men might climb the golden stairs
 And so leave nothing to their heirs.&quot;

A sad example sets for us.
From him we learn how indecision
Of character provokes derision.
This vacillating beast, you see,
Could not decide which he would be--
Fish, flesh or fowl--and chose all three.
The scientists were sorely vexed,
To classify him so perplexed
Their brains that they with rage at bay
Called him a horrid name one day,
A name that baffles, frights and shocks us
Ornithorynchus Paradoxus.
