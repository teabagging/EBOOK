The children of whose faults I tell Are known by other names, as well, So see that <em>you</em> aren&#39;t in this group Of Naughty Ones. <em>Don&#39;t be a Goop</em>!</p><p>MARMADUKE ARGYLL</p><p>A Goop that always makes me smile Is this one: Marmaduke Argyll. His mouth is full from cheek to cheek, Why should he then attempt to speak? It makes me smile, but still, the fact is, It is a most unpleasant practice.</p><p>[Illustration: Talking while Eating]</p><p>NANCY BEAL</p><p>On the sidewalk Nancy Beal Throws her old banana peel; Throws her apple skin and cores, Right in front of people&#39;s doors! Isn&#39;t that a shocking trick? Ask that Goop to stop it, quick!</p><p>[Illustration: Throwing away Things]</p><p>MASTER BILDAD</p><p>A puppy, when he gets a bone, Will keep it for himself alone. So Bildad would not share his toys Or lend them to the other boys. He was a Goop; and so are you If you are ever selfish, too!</p><p>[Illustration: Selfish with Toys]</p><p>PERCY BINGG</p><p>Percy Bingg, when he&#39;s at play, Is almost always in the way; In the room, or in the street, Always under people&#39;s feet! Goops like that annoy me so! <em>You</em> keep out the way, I know!</p><p>[Illustration: In the Way]</p><p>BETSY BIRCH</p><p>Look at little Betsy Birch, Always whispering in church! Always playing with the books, Never caring how she looks! Never knowing Goops like her Ought to neither talk nor stir!</p><p>[Illustration: Talking in Church]</p><p>LEVI BOING</p><p>Are you a Goop, like Levi Boing? He never looks where he is going; He&#39;s always bumping into chairs, And stumbling, when he goes upstairs; He tips things over, bumps his nose. He <em>can&#39;t</em> be careful, I suppose!</p><p>[Illustration: Going Carelessly]</p><p>MARY C. C. CALL</p><p>Mary Carey Cory Call-- Hear her cry and hear her bawl! Hear her groan! Hear her growl! Hear her moan!-- Hear her howl! She&#39;s the goopiest Goop of all, Mary Carey Cory Call!</p><p>[Illustration: Crying Continually]</p><p>LITTLE CORALIE</p><p>Though Coralie was small and sweet, She always, always had wet feet. She liked to walk through puddles; so, She always had a cold, you know. But as <em>you</em> aren&#39;t a Goop, you try To keep your tootsies warm and dry.</p><p>[Illustration: Getting Feet Wet]</p><p>ANDREW CROSSETT</p><p>Have you heard how Andrew Crossett Meddled with the water-faucet? Letting water flood the sink? Andrew was a Goop, I think; Otherwise he would have known He should let such things alone!</p><p>[Illustration: Playing with Faucet]</p><p>ANNABELLA DAY</p><p>How slow is Annabella Day! She&#39;s <em>so</em> reluctant to obey! She acts so sluggish and so sickly! Oh, Anna, why not do it quickly? Oh, Anna, do be prompt, and then, No one will call you &quot;Goop&quot; again!</p><p>[Illustration: Obeying Slowly]</p><p>GWENDOLYN De V. De WITT</p><p>Miss Gwendolyn De Vere De Witt Is having <em>such</em> a sulky fit! Because she couldn&#39;t have her way With other children at their play. A sulky Goop I really call As bad as those who cry and bawl.</p><p>[Illustration: Sulking]</p><p>ADOLPHUS ELFINSTONE</p><p>Adolphus Elfinstone, of Nachez, Thought it was fun to play with matches Until the little Goop had learned It hurt a lot when he got burned! A <em>little</em> fire is queer and curious; But soon it grows quite big and furious.</p><p>[Illustration: Playing with Matches]</p><p>AMANDA FISH</p><p>If there&#39;s sugar in the dish, Who will take it? Mandy Fish? If there is a box of candy, Just look out for little Mandy! She goops the fruit, and leaves the peeling-- <em>She</em> calls it fun; I call it stealing!</p><p>[Illustration: Stealing Sweets]</p><p>FREDERICK FISHER</p><p>Freddie Fisher fairly fussed When he came to eat his crust! Often on the floor he&#39;d throw it, Hoping mother wouldn&#39;t know it! Goops all hate to eat the crust; If you&#39;re told to, then you must!</p><p>[Illustration: Not Eating Crusts]</p><p>EZRA HECHT</p><p>What in the world would you expect Of a Goop whose name was Ezra Hecht? Of <em>course</em> he would refuse to heed Or mind his mother-- yes indeed! Of course he would. Of course he did. But <em>you</em> must do what you are bid.</p><p>[Illustration: Not Minding Mother]</p><p>M. AND B. HOPPER</p><p>Mother always is distressed If you fidget when you&#39;re dressed. If you fidget like Miss Midget, Hopper, or her sister Bridget. Goops like that are <em>so</em> much bother, That they ought to dress each other!</p><p>[Illustration: Restless while Dressing]</p><p>AMANDA M. JAMES</p><p>Amanda Minnesinger James She called her sister horrid names! She called her brother names, as well, So bad I wouldn&#39;t dare to tell! It&#39;s shocking how a Goop will act! They have no manners, that&#39;s a fact.</p><p>[Illustration: Calling Names]</p><p>SUSIE KLEIN</p><p>When e&#39;er I hear a puppy whine, I always think of Susie Klein; I think of how she hangs her head, She doesn&#39;t speak-- she <em>whines</em>, instead! Don&#39;t whine! If you don&#39;t speak right out, You are a Goop, without a doubt!</p><p>[Illustration: Whining]</p><p>ROBERTO LEES</p><p>How thoughtless was Roberto Lees! (For only thoughtless children tease). He teased the little pussy cat, He teased the puppy! Think of that! He even teased his sister, too! I think he was a Goop--don&#39;t you?</p><p>[Illustration: Teasing Animals]</p><p>ANNIE A. LeGRAND</p><p>The queerest Goop in all the land Was Annie Annabelle LeGrand; She often said what wasn&#39;t true-- Which is an awful thing to do! But we are honest, you and I, We think it&#39;s wrong to tell a lie!</p><p>[Illustration: Lying and Fibbing]</p><p>MISS MACKADOO</p><p>This is a Goop-- Miss Mackadoo; She never speaks when spoken to. When spoken to, she turns her eyes, And never answers or replies. She hangs her head and sucks her thumb-- You&#39;d think that she was deaf and dumb!</p><p>[Illustration: Not Answering]</p><p>ISABEL McCLUNG</p><p>Do you ever stick your tongue Out, like Isabel McClung? No one but a Goop would show Rudeness such as that, I know! If you&#39;re good, take my advice; <em>Please</em> don&#39;t do it! &#39;Tisn&#39;t nice.</p><p>[Illustration: Sticking out Tongue]</p><p>ALEXANDER B. McGIFF</p><p>Young Alexander B. McGiff Each day had a clean handkerchief. In spite of this, if you&#39;ll believe, He wiped his nose upon his sleeve! Nobody but a Goop would do it; His mother&#39;d scold him, if she knew it.</p><p>[Illustration: Not Wiping Nose]</p><p>ELIAS E. McGUFF</p><p>Elias Ethelbert McGuff, Oh, he was rude and he was rough! He used to pinch, he used to poke, And called his rudeness just a joke. What made him plague his playmates so? He was a Goop and didn&#39;t know!</p><p>[Illustration: Rough and Rude]</p><p>SOLOMON McKIM</p><p>I wonder if you ever meet The Goop who always scuffs his feet? He makes them drag along the floor As if they weighed a ton or more. Just think of Solomon McKim, And don&#39;t be slovenly like him!</p><p>[Illustration: Scuffing Feet]</p><p>JOHN D. PELL</p><p>When John D. Pell wants something done, D&#39;you think he <em>asks</em> of anyone? Oh, no! He <em>orders</em> someone to, With &quot;Get my hat!&quot; or, &quot;Tie my shoe!&quot; The Goops all say rude things like these, But you, of course, say, &quot;If you please!&quot;</p><p>[Illustration: Ordering People]</p><p>ESAU POUND</p><p>When you&#39;re finished with your play, Do you put your toys away? Do you put away your hat, And your coat, and things like that? Or, are you like Esau Pound? He&#39;s the Goop who leaves things &#39;round!</p><p>[Illustration: Leaving Things Around]</p><p>ELIZA PUDDINGFOOT</p><p>If you should ask why Rosamund Eliza Puddingfoot was shunned, I&#39;d say, because she&#39;d always cheat In every game, so she could beat. Only a Goop would act that way And be dishonest in her play.</p><p>[Illustration: Cheating at Play]</p><p>AMELIA PRATT</p><p>&quot;I won&#39;t!&quot; says young Amelia Pratt; &quot;I won&#39;t do this!&quot; &quot;I won&#39;t do that!&quot; Now isn&#39;t &quot;won&#39;t&quot; the naughtiest word That anyone has ever heard? Now isn&#39;t that the rudest way A Goop could answer? I should say!</p><p>[Illustration: Saying &quot;I won&#39;t&quot;]</p><p>JUMBO RAY</p><p>No children ever like to play With such a Goop as Jumbo Ray. For he will snatch and grab the toys Of all the little girls and boys. Though Jumbo loves to fuss and fight, <em>You</em> know, of course, it isn&#39;t right.</p><p>[Illustration: Snatching Toys]</p><p>ANNIE F. R. RIFF</p><p>Annie Fanny Ruffle Riff; Hear her snuffle! Hear her sniff! Hear her sniffle! Hear her snuff!-- See her--well, I&#39;ve said enough. <em>You</em> have seen her, I suppose, The Goop who seldom blows her nose?</p><p>[Illustration: Snuffling and Sniffling]</p><p>FELICIA ROPPS</p><p>Funny, how Felicia Ropps Always handles things in shops! Always pinching, always poking, Alwyas feeling, always stroking Things she has no right to touch! Goops like that annoy me much!</p><p>[Illustration: Handling Things]</p><p>PERCIVAL B. SLOOP</p><p>Just look at Percival B. Sloop, A most unpleasant sort of Goop; He pokes his fingers in his nose And wipes his hands upon his clothes; He does a lot of things that you, I know, would never, never do!</p><p>[Illustration: Acting Uncleanly]</p><p>SUSIE SMALT</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; says little Susie Smalt, &quot;It is someone else&#39;s fault!&quot; &quot;<em>She</em> began it!&quot; &quot;<em>She&#39;s</em> to blame!&quot; &quot;<em>She&#39;s</em> the one that spoiled the game!&quot; So Goops always blame each other; Do <em>you</em> own up your fault to Mother?</p><p>[Illustration: Blaming Others]</p><p>SPERRY SPROOKS</p><p>Have you ever chanced to look At a torn and dirty book? At a book that&#39;s ragged, soiled, Inked and finger- marked and spoiled? Who has done it? Sperry Sprooks! He&#39;s the Goop that spoils the books!</p><p>[Illustration: Tearing Books]</p><p>URIAH STEAD</p><p>I never saw Uriah Stead When he was glad to go to bed. There always was <em>one</em> thing to do Before he could take off a shoe! The little Goop was always late; I hope <em>you</em> don&#39;t pro-cras-ti-nate!</p><p>[Illustration: Not Going to Bed]</p><p>ROSIE L. V. TROOD</p><p>Rosie Lily Violet Trood, Always messes with her food; Always plays with her potatoes, Meat and gravy and tomatoes! Callers, who are asked to dine, Knowing she&#39;s a Goop, decline!</p><p>End of # The Goop Directory, by Gelett Burgess</p><p>*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GOOP DIRECTORY ***</p><p>***** This file should be named 13035.txt or 13035.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/0/3/13035/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/0/3/13035/</a></p><p>Produced by David Newman.</p>',129)]))}const g=o(n,[["render",i]]);export{y as __pageData,g as default};
