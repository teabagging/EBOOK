                          To
                       MY DOG,
             Who first heard these lines
                 And didn&#39;t run away
                         MAD,
                I Reverently Dedicate
                      This Tome
</code></pre><p>&quot;A Fool may give a Wise Man counsel.&quot;</p><p><em>Preface.</em></p><p>In this age of the arduous pursuit of peace, prosperity and pleasure, the smallest contribution to the gaiety, if not to the wisdom, of nations can scarcely be unwelcome. With this in mind, the author has prepared &quot;The Foolish Dictionary,&quot; not in serious emulation of the worthier--and wordier--works of Webster and Worcester, but rather in the playful spirit of the parodist, who would gladly direct the faint rays from his flickering candle of fun to the shrine of their great memories.</p><p>With half a million English words to choose from, modesty has been the watchword, and the author has confined himself to the treatment of only about half a thousand. How wise, flippant, sober or stupid, this treatment has been, it is for the reader alone to judge. However, if from epigram, derivative or pure absurdity, there be born a single laugh between the lids, the laborer will accredit himself worthy of his hire.</p><p>In further explanation it should be said that some slight deference has been made to other wits, and the definitions include a few quotations from the great minds of the past and present. As for the rest, the jury will please acknowledge a plea of guilty from</p><pre><code>                                              GIDEON WURDZ.

</code></pre><p>=ZOUAVE=</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p>The original Mrs. Bloomer.</p><p><em>Postage and Postal Information</em>.</p><p><em>How to Mail a Letter</em>.</p><p>After writing it, place it in a square or oblong envelope--round ones are no longer fashionable--seal it on the back and write a legible address on the front; then take a two-cent stamp, give it a good licking and retire it to the corner--the upper, right-hand corner, on the outside--never inside, as the postmaster is not a clairvoyant. Drop it in a letter-box and trust to luck. If it&#39;s a love letter, it will probably reach her all right, for Cupid is a faithful postman and carries a stout pair of wings. If it&#39;s a bill, by all means have it registered; otherwise, your debtor will swear he never got it. If it&#39;s cash for your tailor, heed the post-office warning, &quot;Don&#39;t send money through the mails.&quot; Wait until you happen to meet him on the street. If he sees you first, you lose.</p><p>=First-class Matter.=</p><p>Anything you are ashamed to have the postmaster or postmistress read, and therefore seal up, is known as first-class matter. Also, postal cards, where you&#39;re only allowed to argue on one side. If you think your letter should travel slowly, invest ten cents in a Special Delivery Stamp. This will insure a nice, leisurely journey, lasting from one to two days longer than by the cheap two-cent route.</p><p>=Second-class Matter.=</p><p>This class was originated for the benefit of Patent Medicine Mixers, who print circulars on &quot;What Ails You&quot; four times a year, and pepper the land with &quot;Before-and-after-taking&quot; caricatures, at the rate of one cent a pound.</p><p>=Third-class Matter.=</p><p>While the quack nostrums travel second-class for one cent a pound, books, engravings, manuscript copy, and works of art have to go third-class and are taxed one cent for every two ounces. They must also be left open for inspection, thus affording the post-office employee a fleeting acquaintance with something really useful.</p><p>=Fourth-class Matter.=</p><p>Everything not included in the above, except poisons, explosives, live animals, insects, inflammable articles, and things giving off a bad odor. The last two do not include <em>The Police Gazette</em> or <em>The Philistine</em>.</p><p><em>A Few Mythological and Classical Names.</em></p><p><em>Brought down to date in brief Notes by the Editor.</em></p><p>ACHILLES. A courageous Greek, who did a general slaughtering business in Troy in 1180 B.C., but was finally pinked in the heel--his only vulnerable spot--and died.</p><p><em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em>-<em>-</em></p><p>=Long life often depends on being well heeled.=</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
