The case I know will interest you, and no one else could deal with it so well. In fact, no ordinary professional man could deal with it at all, for I know of no treatment nor medicine that can restore a lost sense of humour!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You begin to interest me with your &#39;case,&#39;&quot; he replied, and made himself comfortable to listen.</p><p>Mrs. Sivendson drew a sigh of contentment as she watched him go to the tube and heard him tell the servant he was not to be disturbed.</p><p>&quot;I believe you have read my thoughts already,&quot; she said; &quot;your intuitive knowledge of what goes on in other people&#39;s minds is positively uncanny.&quot;</p><p>Her friend shook his head and smiled as he drew his chair up to a convenient position and prepared to listen attentively to what she had to say. He closed his eyes, as he always did when he wished to absorb the real meaning of a recital that might be inadequately expressed, for by this method he found it easier to set himself in tune with the living thoughts that lay behind the broken words.</p><p>By his friends John Silence was regarded as an eccentric, because he was rich by accident, and by choice--a doctor. That a man of independent means should devote his time to doctoring, chiefly doctoring folk who could not pay, passed their comprehension entirely. The native nobility of a soul whose first desire was to help those who could not help themselves, puzzled them. After that, it irritated them, and, greatly to his own satisfaction, they left him to his own devices.</p><p>Dr. Silence was a free-lance, though, among doctors, having neither consulting-room, bookkeeper, nor professional manner. He took no fees, being at heart a genuine philanthropist, yet at the same time did no harm to his fellow-practitioners, because he only accepted unremunerative cases, and cases that interested him for some very special reason. He argued that the rich could pay, and the very poor could avail themselves of organised charity, but that a very large class of ill-paid, self-respecting workers, often followers of the arts, could not afford the price of a week&#39;s comforts merely to be told to travel. And it was these he desired to help: cases often requiring special and patient study--things no doctor can give for a guinea, and that no one would dream of expecting him to give.</p><p>But there was another side to his personality and practice, and one with which we are now more directly concerned; for the cases that especially appealed to him were of no ordinary kind, but rather of that intangible, elusive, and difficult nature best described as psychical afflictions; and, though he would have been the last person himself to approve of the title, it was beyond question that he was known more or less generally as the &quot;Psychic Doctor.&quot;</p><p>In order to grapple with cases of this peculiar kind, he had submitted himself to a long and severe training, at once physical, mental, and spiritual. What precisely this training had been, or where undergone, no one seemed to know,--for he never spoke of it, as, indeed, he betrayed no single other characteristic of the charlatan,--but the fact that it had involved a total disappearance from the world for five years, and that after he returned and began his singular practice no one ever dreamed of applying to him the so easily acquired epithet of quack, spoke much for the seriousness of his strange quest and also for the genuineness of his attainments.</p><p>For the modern psychical researcher he felt the calm tolerance of the &quot;man who knows.&quot; There was a trace of pity in his voice--contempt he never showed--when he spoke of their methods.</p><p>&quot;This classification of results is uninspired work at best,&quot; he said once to me, when I had been his confidential assistant for some years. &quot;It leads nowhere, and after a hundred years will lead nowhere. It is playing with the wrong end of a rather dangerous toy. Far better, it would be, to examine the causes, and then the results would so easily slip into place and explain themselves. For the sources are accessible, and open to all who have the courage to lead the life that alone makes practical investigation safe and possible.&quot;</p><p>And towards the question of clairvoyance, too, his attitude was significantly sane, for he knew how extremely rare the genuine power was, and that what is commonly called clairvoyance is nothing more than a keen power of visualising.</p><p>&quot;It connotes a slightly increased sensibility, nothing more,&quot; he would say. &quot;The true clairvoyant deplores his power, recognising that it adds a new horror to life, and is in the nature of an affliction. And you will find this always to be the real test.&quot;</p><p>Thus it was that John Silence, this singularly developed doctor, was able to select his cases with a clear knowledge of the difference between mere hysterical delusion and the kind of psychical affliction that claimed his special powers. It was never necessary for him to resort to the cheap mysteries of divination; for, as I have heard him observe, after the solution of some peculiarly intricate problem--</p><p>&quot;Systems of divination, from geomancy down to reading by tea-leaves, are merely so many methods of obscuring the outer vision, in order that the inner vision may become open. Once the method is mastered, no system is necessary at all.&quot;</p><p>And the words were significant of the methods of this remarkable man, the keynote of whose power lay, perhaps, more than anything else, in the knowledge, first, that thought can act at a distance, and, secondly, that thought is dynamic and can accomplish material results.</p><p>&quot;Learn how to <em>think</em>,&quot; he would have expressed it, &quot;and you have learned to tap power at its source.&quot;</p><p>To look at--he was now past forty--he was sparely built, with speaking brown eyes in which shone the light of knowledge and self-confidence, while at the same time they made one think of that wondrous gentleness seen most often in the eyes of animals. A close beard concealed the mouth without disguising the grim determination of lips and jaw, and the face somehow conveyed an impression of transparency, almost of light, so delicately were the features refined away. On the fine forehead was that indefinable touch of peace that comes from identifying the mind with what is permanent in the soul, and letting the impermanent slip by without power to wound or distress; while, from his manner,--so gentle, quiet, sympathetic,--few could have guessed the strength of purpose that burned within like a great flame.</p><p>&quot;I think I should describe it as a psychical case,&quot; continued the Swedish lady, obviously trying to explain herself very intelligently, &quot;and just the kind you like. I mean a case where the cause is hidden deep down in some spiritual distress, and--&quot;</p><p>&quot;But the symptoms first, please, my dear Svenska,&quot; he interrupted, with a strangely compelling seriousness of manner, &quot;and your deductions afterwards.&quot;</p><p>She turned round sharply on the edge of her chair and looked him in the face, lowering her voice to prevent her emotion betraying itself too obviously.</p><p>&quot;In my opinion there&#39;s only one symptom,&quot; she half whispered, as though telling something disagreeable--&quot;fear--simply fear.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Physical fear?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think not; though how can I say? I think it&#39;s a horror in the psychical region. It&#39;s no ordinary delusion; the man is quite sane; but he lives in mortal terror of something--&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean by his &#39;psychical region,&#39;&quot; said the doctor, with a smile; &quot;though I suppose you wish me to understand that his spiritual, and not his mental, processes are affected. Anyhow, try and tell me briefly and pointedly what you know about the man, his symptoms, his need for help, my peculiar help, that is, and all that seems vital in the case. I promise to listen devotedly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am trying,&quot; she continued earnestly, &quot;but must do so in my own words and trust to your intelligence to disentangle as I go along. He is a young author, and lives in a tiny house off Putney Heath somewhere. He writes humorous stories--quite a genre of his own: Pender--you must have heard the name--Felix Pender? Oh, the man had a great gift, and married on the strength of it; his future seemed assured. I say &#39;had,&#39; for quite suddenly his talent utterly failed him. Worse, it became transformed into its opposite. He can no longer write a line in the old way that was bringing him success--&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence opened his eyes for a second and looked at her.</p><p>&quot;He still writes, then? The force has not gone?&quot; he asked briefly, and then closed his eyes again to listen.</p><p>&quot;He works like a fury,&quot; she went on, &quot;but produces nothing&quot;--she hesitated a moment--&quot;nothing that he can use or sell. His earnings have practically ceased, and he makes a precarious living by book-reviewing and odd jobs--very odd, some of them. Yet, I am certain his talent has not really deserted him finally, but is merely--&quot;</p><p>Again Mrs. Sivendson hesitated for the appropriate word.</p><p>&quot;In abeyance,&quot; he suggested, without opening his eyes.</p><p>&quot;Obliterated,&quot; she went on, after a moment to weigh the word, &quot;merely obliterated by something else--&quot;</p><p>&quot;By some one else?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wish I knew. All I can say is that he is haunted, and temporarily his sense of humour is shrouded--gone--replaced by something dreadful that writes other things. Unless something competent is done, he will simply starve to death. Yet he is afraid to go to a doctor for fear of being pronounced insane; and, anyhow, a man can hardly ask a doctor to take a guinea to restore a vanished sense of humour, can he?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Has he tried any one at all--?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not doctors yet. He tried some clergymen and religious people; but they know so little and have so little intelligent sympathy. And most of them are so busy balancing on their own little pedestals--&quot;</p><p>John Silence stopped her tirade with a gesture.</p><p>&quot;And how is it that you know so much about him?&quot; he asked gently.</p><p>&quot;I know Mrs. Pender well--I knew her before she married him--&quot;</p><p>&quot;And is she a cause, perhaps?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not in the least. She is devoted; a woman very well educated, though without being really intelligent, and with so little sense of humour herself that she always laughs at the wrong places. But she has nothing to do with the cause of his distress; and, indeed, has chiefly guessed it from observing him, rather than from what little he has told her. And he, you know, is a really lovable fellow, hard-working, patient--altogether worth saving.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence opened his eyes and went over to ring for tea. He did not know very much more about the case of the humorist than when he first sat down to listen; but he realised that no amount of words from his Swedish friend would help to reveal the real facts. A personal interview with the author himself could alone do that.</p><p>&quot;All humorists are worth saving,&quot; he said with a smile, as she poured out tea. &quot;We can&#39;t afford to lose a single one in these strenuous days. I will go and see your friend at the first opportunity.&quot;</p><p>She thanked him elaborately, effusively, with many words, and he, with much difficulty, kept the conversation thenceforward strictly to the teapot.</p><p>And, as a result of this conversation, and a little more he had gathered by means best known to himself and his secretary, he was whizzing in his motor-car one afternoon a few days later up the Putney Hill to have his first interview with Felix Pender, the humorous writer who was the victim of some mysterious malady in his &quot;psychical region&quot; that had obliterated his sense of the comic and threatened to wreck his life and destroy his talent. And his desire to help was probably of equal strength with his desire to know and to investigate.</p><p>The motor stopped with a deep purring sound, as though a great black panther lay concealed within its hood, and the doctor--the &quot;psychic doctor,&quot; as he was sometimes called--stepped out through the gathering fog, and walked across the tiny garden that held a blackened fir tree and a stunted laurel shrubbery. The house was very small, and it was some time before any one answered the bell. Then, suddenly, a light appeared in the hall, and he saw a pretty little woman standing on the top step begging him to come in. She was dressed in grey, and the gaslight fell on a mass of deliberately brushed light hair. Stuffed, dusty birds, and a shabby array of African spears, hung on the wall behind her. A hat-rack, with a bronze plate full of very large cards, led his eye swiftly to a dark staircase beyond. Mrs. Pender had round eyes like a child&#39;s, and she greeted him with an effusiveness that barely concealed her emotion, yet strove to appear naturally cordial. Evidently she had been looking out for his arrival, and had outrun the servant girl. She was a little breathless.</p><p>&quot;I hope you&#39;ve not been kept waiting--I think it&#39;s <em>most</em> good of you to come--&quot; she began, and then stopped sharp when she saw his face in the gaslight. There was something in Dr. Silence&#39;s look that did not encourage mere talk. He was in earnest now, if ever man was.</p><p>&quot;Good evening, Mrs. Pender,&quot; he said, with a quiet smile that won confidence, yet deprecated unnecessary words, &quot;the fog delayed me a little. I am glad to see you.&quot;</p><p>They went into a dingy sitting-room at the back of the house, neatly furnished but depressing. Books stood in a row upon the mantelpiece. The fire had evidently just been lit. It smoked in great puffs into the room.</p><p>&quot;Mrs. Sivendson said she thought you might be able to come,&quot; ventured the little woman again, looking up engagingly into his face and betraying anxiety and eagerness in every gesture. &quot;But I hardly dared to believe it. I think it is really too good of you. My husband&#39;s case is so peculiar that--well, you know, I am quite sure any <em>ordinary</em> doctor would say at once the asylum--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Isn&#39;t he in, then?&quot; asked Dr. Silence gently.</p><p>&quot;In the asylum?&quot; she gasped. &quot;Oh dear, no--not yet!&quot;</p><p>&quot;In the house, I meant,&quot; he laughed.</p><p>She gave a great sigh.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;ll be back any minute now,&quot; she replied, obviously relieved to see him laugh; &quot;but the fact is, we didn&#39;t expect you so early--I mean, my husband hardly thought you would come at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am always delighted to come--when I am really wanted, and can be of help,&quot; he said quickly; &quot;and, perhaps, it&#39;s all for the best that your husband is out, for now that we are alone you can tell me something about his difficulties. So far, you know, I have heard very little.&quot;</p><p>Her voice trembled as she thanked him, and when he came and took a chair close beside her she actually had difficulty in finding words with which to begin.</p><p>&quot;In the first place,&quot; she began timidly, and then continuing with a nervous incoherent rush of words, &quot;he will be simply delighted that you&#39;ve really come, because he said you were the only person he would consent to see at all--the only doctor, I mean. But, of course, he doesn&#39;t know how frightened I am, or how much I have noticed. He pretends with me that it&#39;s just a nervous breakdown, and I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t realise all the odd things I&#39;ve noticed him doing. But the main thing, I suppose--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, the main thing, Mrs. Pender,&quot; he said, encouragingly, noticing her hesitation.</p><p>&quot;--is that he thinks we are not alone in the house. That&#39;s the chief thing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tell me more facts--just facts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It began last summer when I came back from Ireland; he had been here alone for six weeks, and I thought him looking tired and queer--ragged and scattered about the face, if you know what I mean, and his manner worn out. He said he had been writing hard, but his inspiration had somehow failed him, and he was dissatisfied with his work. His sense of humour was leaving him, or changing into something else, he said. There was something in the house, he declared, that&quot;--she emphasised the words--&quot;prevented his feeling funny.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Something in the house that prevented his feeling funny,&quot; repeated the doctor. &quot;Ah, now we&#39;re getting to the heart of it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she resumed vaguely, &quot;that&#39;s what he kept saying.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what was it he <em>did</em> that you thought strange?&quot; he asked sympathetically. &quot;Be brief, or he may be here before you finish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very small things, but significant it seemed to me. He changed his workroom from the library, as we call it, to the sitting-room. He said all his characters became wrong and terrible in the library; they altered, so that he felt like writing tragedies--vile, debased tragedies, the tragedies of broken souls. But now he says the same of the sitting-room, and he&#39;s gone back to the library.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You see, there&#39;s so little I can tell you,&quot; she went on, with increasing speed and countless gestures. &quot;I mean it&#39;s only very small things he does and says that are queer. What frightens me is that he assumes there is some one else in the house all the time--some one I never see. He does not actually say so, but on the stairs I&#39;ve seen him standing aside to let some one pass; I&#39;ve seen him open a door to let some one in or out; and often in our bedrooms he puts chairs about as though for some one else to sit in. Oh--oh yes, and once or twice,&quot; she cried--&quot;once or twice--&quot;</p><p>She paused, and looked about her with a startled air.</p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Once or twice,&quot; she resumed hurriedly, as though she heard a sound that alarmed her, &quot;I&#39;ve heard him running--coming in and out of the rooms breathless as if something were after him--&quot;</p><p>The door opened while she was still speaking, cutting her words off in the middle, and a man came into the room. He was dark and clean-shaven, sallow rather, with the eyes of imagination, and dark hair growing scantily about the temples. He was dressed in a shabby tweed suit, and wore an untidy flannel collar at the neck. The dominant expression of his face was startled--hunted; an expression that might any moment leap into the dreadful stare of terror and announce a total loss of self-control.</p><p>The moment he saw his visitor a smile spread over his worn features, and he advanced to shake hands.</p><p>&quot;I hoped you would come; Mrs. Sivendson said you might be able to find time,&quot; he said simply. His voice was thin and needy. &quot;I am very glad to see you, Dr. Silence. It is &#39;Doctor,&#39; is it not?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I am entitled to the description,&quot; laughed the other, &quot;but I rarely get it. You know, I do not practise as a regular thing; that is, I only take cases that specially interest me, or--&quot;</p><p>He did not finish the sentence, for the men exchanged a glance of sympathy that rendered it unnecessary.</p><p>&quot;I have heard of your great kindness.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s my hobby,&quot; said the other quickly, &quot;and my privilege.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I trust you will still think so when you have heard what I have to tell you,&quot; continued the author, a little wearily. He led the way across the hall into the little smoking-room where they could talk freely and undisturbed.</p><p>In the smoking-room, the door shut and privacy about them, Fender&#39;s attitude changed somewhat, and his manner became very grave. The doctor sat opposite, where he could watch his face. Already, he saw, it looked more haggard. Evidently it cost him much to refer to his trouble at all.</p><p>&quot;What I have is, in my belief, a profound spiritual affliction,&quot; he began quite bluntly, looking straight into the other&#39;s eyes.</p><p>&quot;I saw that at once,&quot; Dr. Silence said.</p><p>&quot;Yes, you saw that, of course; my atmosphere must convey that much to any one with psychic perceptions. Besides which, I feel sure from all I&#39;ve heard, that you are really a soul-doctor, are you not, more than a healer merely of the body?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think of me too highly,&quot; returned the other; &quot;though I prefer cases, as you know, in which the spirit is disturbed first, the body afterwards.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand, yes. Well, I have experienced a curious disturbance in--not in my physical region primarily. I mean my nerves are all right, and my body is all right. I have no delusions exactly, but my spirit is tortured by a calamitous fear which first came upon me in a strange manner.&quot;</p><p>John Silence leaned forward a moment and took the speaker&#39;s hand and held it in his own for a few brief seconds, closing his eyes as he did so. He was not feeling his pulse, or doing any of the things that doctors ordinarily do; he was merely absorbing into himself the main note of the man&#39;s mental condition, so as to get completely his own point of view, and thus be able to treat his case with true sympathy. A very close observer might perhaps have noticed that a slight tremor ran through his frame after he had held the hand for a few seconds.</p><p>&quot;Tell me quite frankly, Mr. Pender,&quot; he said soothingly, releasing the hand, and with deep attention in his manner, &quot;tell me all the steps that led to the beginning of this invasion. I mean tell me what the particular drug was, and why you took it, and how it affected you--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then you know it began with a drug!&quot; cried the author, with undisguised astonishment.</p><p>&quot;I only know from what I observe in you, and in its effect upon myself. You are in a surprising psychical condition. Certain portions of your atmosphere are vibrating at a far greater rate than others. This is the effect of a drug, but of no ordinary drug. Allow me to finish, please. If the higher rate of vibration spreads all over, you will become, of course, permanently cognisant of a much larger world than the one you know normally. If, on the other hand, the rapid portion sinks back to the usual rate, you will lose these occasional increased perceptions you now have.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You amaze me!&quot; exclaimed the author; &quot;for your words exactly describe what I have been feeling--&quot;</p><p>&quot;I mention this only in passing, and to give you confidence before you approach the account of your real affliction,&quot; continued the doctor. &quot;All perception, as you know, is the result of vibrations; and clairvoyance simply means becoming sensitive to an increased scale of vibrations. The awakening of the inner senses we hear so much about means no more than that. Your partial clairvoyance is easily explained. The only thing that puzzles me is how you managed to procure the drug, for it is not easy to get in pure form, and no adulterated tincture could have given you the terrific impetus I see you have acquired. But, please proceed now and tell me your story in your own way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This <em>Cannabis indica</em>,&quot; the author went on, &quot;came into my possession last autumn while my wife was away. I need not explain how I got it, for that has no importance; but it was the genuine fluid extract, and I could not resist the temptation to make an experiment. One of its effects, as you know, is to induce torrential laughter--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes: sometimes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;--I am a writer of humorous tales, and I wished to increase my own sense of laughter--to see the ludicrous from an abnormal point of view. I wished to study it a bit, if possible, and--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tell me!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I took an experimental dose. I starved for six hours to hasten the effect, locked myself into this room, and gave orders not to be disturbed. Then I swallowed the stuff and waited.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the effect?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I waited one hour, two, three, four, five hours. Nothing happened. No laughter came, but only a great weariness instead. Nothing in the room or in my thoughts came within a hundred miles of a humorous aspect.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Always a most uncertain drug,&quot; interrupted the doctor. &quot;We make very small use of it on that account.&quot;</p><p>&quot;At two o&#39;clock in the morning I felt so hungry and tired that I decided to give up the experiment and wait no longer. I drank some milk and went upstairs to bed. I felt flat and disappointed. I fell asleep at once and must have slept for about an hour, when I awoke suddenly with a great noise in my ears. It was the noise of my own laughter! I was simply shaking with merriment. At first I was bewildered and thought I had been laughing in dreams, but a moment later I remembered the drug, and was delighted to think that after all I had got an effect. It had been working all along, only I had miscalculated the time. The only unpleasant thing <em>then</em> was an odd feeling that I had not waked naturally, but had been wakened by some one else--deliberately. This came to me as a certainty in the middle of my noisy laughter and distressed me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Any impression who it could have been?&quot; asked the doctor, now listening with close attention to every word, very much on the alert.</p><p>Pender hesitated and tried to smile. He brushed his hair from his forehead with a nervous gesture.</p><p>&quot;You must tell me all your impressions, even your fancies; they are quite as important as your certainties.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I had a vague idea that it was some one connected with my forgotten dream, some one who had been at me in my sleep, some one of great strength and great ability--of great force--quite an unusual personality--and, I was certain, too--a woman.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A good woman?&quot; asked John Silence quietly.</p><p>Pender started a little at the question and his sallow face flushed; it seemed to surprise him. But he shook his head quickly with an indefinable look of horror.</p><p>&quot;Evil,&quot; he answered briefly, &quot;appallingly evil, and yet mingled with the sheer wickedness of it was also a certain perverseness--the perversity of the unbalanced mind.&quot;</p><p>He hesitated a moment and looked up sharply at his interlocutor. A shade of suspicion showed itself in his eyes.</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; laughed the doctor, &quot;you need not fear that I&#39;m merely humouring you, or think you mad. Far from it. Your story interests me exceedingly and you furnish me unconsciously with a number of clues as you tell it. You see, I possess some knowledge of my own as to these psychic byways.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was shaking with such violent laughter,&quot; continued the narrator, reassured in a moment, &quot;though with no clear idea what was amusing me, that I had the greatest difficulty in getting up for the matches, and was afraid I should frighten the servants overhead with my explosions. When the gas was lit I found the room empty, of course, and the door locked as usual. Then I half dressed and went out on to the landing, my hilarity better under control, and proceeded to go downstairs. I wished to record my sensations. I stuffed a handkerchief into my mouth so as not to scream aloud and communicate my hysterics to the entire household.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the presence of this--this--?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was hanging about me all the time,&quot; said Pender, &quot;but for the moment it seemed to have withdrawn. Probably, too, my laughter killed all other emotions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And how long did you take getting downstairs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was just coming to that. I see you know all my &#39;symptoms&#39; in advance, as it were; for, of course, I thought I should never get to the bottom. Each step seemed to take five minutes, and crossing the narrow hall at the foot of the stairs--well, I could have sworn it was half an hour&#39;s journey had not my watch certified that it was a few seconds. Yet I walked fast and tried to push on. It was no good. I walked apparently without advancing, and at that rate it would have taken me a week to get down Putney Hill.&quot;</p><p>&quot;An experimental dose radically alters the scale of time and space sometimes--&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, when at last I got into my study and lit the gas, the change came horridly, and sudden as a flash of lightning. It was like a douche of icy water, and in the middle of this storm of laughter--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes; what?&quot; asked the doctor, leaning forward and peering into his eyes.</p><p>&quot;--I was overwhelmed with terror,&quot; said Pender, lowering his reedy voice at the mere recollection of it.</p><p>He paused a moment and mopped his forehead. The scared, hunted look in his eyes now dominated the whole face. Yet, all the time, the corners of his mouth hinted of possible laughter as though the recollection of that merriment still amused him. The combination of fear and laughter in his face was very curious, and lent great conviction to his story; it also lent a bizarre expression of horror to his gestures.</p><p>&quot;Terror, was it?&quot; repeated the doctor soothingly.</p><p>&quot;Yes, terror; for, though the Thing that woke me seemed to have gone, the memory of it still frightened me, and I collapsed into a chair. Then I locked the door and tried to reason with myself, but the drug made my movements so prolonged that it took me five minutes to reach the door, and another five to get back to the chair again. The laughter, too, kept bubbling up inside me--great wholesome laughter that shook me like gusts of wind--so that even my terror almost made me laugh. Oh, but I may tell you, Dr. Silence, it was altogether vile, that mixture of fear and laughter, altogether vile!</p><p>&quot;Then, all at once, the things in the room again presented their funny side to me and set me off laughing more furiously than ever. The bookcase was ludicrous, the arm-chair a perfect clown, the way the clock looked at me on the mantelpiece too comic for words; the arrangement of papers and inkstand on the desk tickled me till I roared and shook and held my sides and the tears streamed down my cheeks. And that footstool! Oh, that absurd footstool!&quot;</p><p>He lay back in his chair, laughing to himself and holding up his hands at the thought of it, and at the sight of him Dr. Silence laughed, too.</p><p>&quot;Go on, please,&quot; he said, &quot;I quite understand. I know something myself of the hashish laughter.&quot;</p><p>The author pulled himself together and resumed, his face growing quickly grave again.</p><p>&quot;So, you see, side by side with this extravagant, apparently causeless merriment, there was also an extravagant, apparently causeless terror. The drug produced the laughter, I knew; but what brought in the terror I could not imagine. Everywhere behind the fun lay the fear. It was terror masked by cap and bells; and I became the playground for two opposing emotions, armed and fighting to the death. Gradually, then, the impression grew in me that this fear was caused by the invasion--so you called it just now--of the &#39;person&#39; who had wakened me: she was utterly evil; inimical to my soul, or at least to all in me that wished for good. There I stood, sweating and trembling, laughing at everything in the room, yet all the while with this white terror mastering my heart. And this creature was putting--putting her--&quot;</p><p>He hesitated again, using his handkerchief freely.</p><p>&quot;Putting what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;--putting ideas into my mind,&quot; he went on glancing nervously about the room. &quot;Actually tapping my thought-stream so as to switch off the usual current and inject her own. How mad that sounds! I know it, but it&#39;s true. It&#39;s the only way I can express it. Moreover, while the operation terrified me, the skill with which it was accomplished filled me afresh with laughter at the clumsiness of men by comparison. Our ignorant, bungling methods of teaching the minds of others, of inculcating ideas, and so on, overwhelmed me with laughter when I understood this superior and diabolical method. Yet my laughter seemed hollow and ghastly, and ideas of evil and tragedy trod close upon the heels of the comic. Oh, doctor, I tell you again, it was unnerving!&quot;</p><p>John Silence sat with his head thrust forward to catch every word of the story which the other continued to pour out in nervous, jerky sentences and lowered voice.</p><p>&quot;You saw nothing--no one--all this time?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;Not with my eyes. There was no visual hallucination. But in my mind there began to grow the vivid picture of a woman--large, dark-skinned, with white teeth and masculine features, and one eye--the left--so drooping as to appear almost closed. Oh, such a face--!&quot;</p><p>&quot;A face you would recognise again?&quot;</p><p>Pender laughed dreadfully.</p><p>&quot;I wish I could forget it,&quot; he whispered, &quot;I only wish I could forget it!&quot; Then he sat forward in his chair suddenly, and grasped the doctor&#39;s hand with an emotional gesture.</p><p>&quot;I <em>must</em> tell you how grateful I am for your patience and sympathy,&quot; he cried, with a tremor in his voice, &quot;and--that you do not think me mad. I have told no one else a quarter of all this, and the mere freedom of speech--the relief of sharing my affliction with another--has helped me already more than I can possibly say.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence pressed his hand and looked steadily into the frightened eyes. His voice was very gentle when he replied.</p><p>&quot;Your case, you know, is very singular, but of absorbing interest to me,&quot; he said, &quot;for it threatens, not your physical existence but the temple of your psychical existence--the inner life. Your mind would not be permanently affected here and now, in this world; but in the existence after the body is left behind, you might wake up with your spirit so twisted, so distorted, so befouled, that you would be <em>spiritually insane</em>--a far more radical condition than merely being insane here.&quot;</p><p>There came a strange hush over the room, and between the two men sitting there facing one another.</p><p>&quot;Do you really mean--Good Lord!&quot; stammered the author as soon as he could find his tongue.</p><p>&quot;What I mean in detail will keep till a little later, and I need only say now that I should not have spoken in this way unless I were quite positive of being able to help you. Oh, there&#39;s no doubt as to that, believe me. In the first place, I am very familiar with the workings of this extraordinary drug, this drug which has had the chance effect of opening you up to the forces of another region; and, in the second, I have a firm belief in the reality of supersensuous occurrences as well as considerable knowledge of psychic processes acquired by long and painful experiment. The rest is, or should be, merely sympathetic treatment and practical application. The hashish has partially opened another world to you by increasing your rate of psychical vibration, and thus rendering you abnormally sensitive. Ancient forces attached to this house have attacked you. For the moment I am only puzzled as to their precise nature; for were they of an ordinary character, I should myself be psychic enough to feel them. Yet I am conscious of feeling nothing as yet. But now, please continue, Mr. Pender, and tell me the rest of your wonderful story; and when you have finished, I will talk about the means of cure.&quot;</p><p>Pender shifted his chair a little closer to the friendly doctor and then went on in the same nervous voice with his narrative.</p><p>&quot;After making some notes of my impressions I finally got upstairs again to bed. It was four o&#39;clock in the morning. I laughed all the way up--at the grotesque banisters, the droll physiognomy of the staircase window, the burlesque grouping of the furniture, and the memory of that outrageous footstool in the room below; but nothing more happened to alarm or disturb me, and I woke late in the morning after a dreamless sleep, none the worse for my experiment except for a slight headache and a coldness of the extremities due to lowered circulation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fear gone, too?&quot; asked the doctor.</p><p>&quot;I seemed to have forgotten it, or at least ascribed it to mere nervousness. Its reality had gone, anyhow for the time, and all that day I wrote and wrote and wrote. My sense of laughter seemed wonderfully quickened and my characters acted without effort out of the heart of true humour. I was exceedingly pleased with this result of my experiment. But when the stenographer had taken her departure and I came to read over the pages she had typed out, I recalled her sudden glances of surprise and the odd way she had looked up at me while I was dictating. I was amazed at what I read and could hardly believe I had uttered it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was so distorted. The words, indeed, were mine so far as I could remember, but the meanings seemed strange. It frightened me. The sense was so altered. At the very places where my characters were intended to tickle the ribs, only curious emotions of sinister amusement resulted. Dreadful innuendoes had managed to creep into the phrases. There was laughter of a kind, but it was bizarre, horrible, distressing; and my attempt at analysis only increased my dismay. The story, as it read then, made me shudder, for by virtue of these slight changes it had come somehow to hold the soul of horror, of horror disguised as merriment. The framework of humour was there, if you understand me, but the characters had turned sinister, and their laughter was evil.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you show me this writing?&quot;</p><p>The author shook his head.</p><p>&quot;I destroyed it,&quot; he whispered. &quot;But, in the end, though of course much perturbed about it, I persuaded myself that it was due to some after-effect of the drug, a sort of reaction that gave a twist to my mind and made me read macabre interpretations into words and situations that did not properly hold them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And, meanwhile, did the presence of this person leave you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No; that stayed more or less. When my mind was actively employed I forgot it, but when idle, dreaming, or doing nothing in particular, there she was beside me, influencing my mind horribly--&quot;</p><p>&quot;In what way, precisely?&quot; interrupted the doctor.</p><p>&quot;Evil, scheming thoughts came to me, visions of crime, hateful pictures of wickedness, and the kind of bad imagination that so far has been foreign, indeed impossible, to my normal nature--&quot;</p><p>&quot;The pressure of the Dark Powers upon the personality,&quot; murmured the doctor, making a quick note.</p><p>&quot;Eh? I didn&#39;t quite catch--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pray, go on. I am merely making notes; you shall know their purport fully later.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Even when my wife returned I was still aware of this Presence in the house; it associated itself with my inner personality in most intimate fashion; and outwardly I always felt oddly constrained to be polite and respectful towards it--to open doors, provide chairs and hold myself carefully deferential when it was about. It became very compelling at last, and, if I failed in any little particular, I seemed to know that it pursued me about the house, from one room to another, haunting my very soul in its inmost abode. It certainly came before my wife so far as my attentions were concerned.</p><p>&quot;But, let me first finish the story of my experimental dose, for I took it again the third night, and underwent a very similar experience, delayed like the first in coming, and then carrying me off my feet when it did come with a rush of this false demon-laughter. This time, however, there was a reversal of the changed scale of space and time; it shortened instead of lengthened, so that I dressed and got downstairs in about twenty seconds, and the couple of hours I stayed and worked in the study passed literally like a period of ten minutes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is often true of an overdose,&quot; interjected the doctor, &quot;and you may go a mile in a few minutes, or a few yards in a quarter of an hour. It is quite incomprehensible to those who have never experienced it, and is a curious proof that time and space are merely forms of thought.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This time,&quot; Pender went on, talking more and more rapidly in his excitement, &quot;another extraordinary effect came to me, and I experienced a curious changing of the senses, so that I perceived external things through one large main sense-channel instead of through the five divisions known as sight, smell, touch, and so forth. You will, I know, understand me when I tell you that I <em>heard</em> sights and <em>saw</em> sounds. No language can make this comprehensible, of course, and I can only say, for instance, that the striking of the clock I saw as a visible picture in the air before me. I saw the sounds of the tinkling bell. And in precisely the same way I heard the colours in the room, especially the colours of those books in the shelf behind you. Those red bindings I heard in deep sounds, and the yellow covers of the French bindings next to them made a shrill, piercing note not unlike the chattering of starlings. That brown bookcase muttered, and those green curtains opposite kept up a constant sort of rippling sound like the lower notes of a wood-horn. But I only was conscious of these sounds when I looked steadily at the different objects, and thought about them. The room, you understand, was not full of a chorus of notes; but when I concentrated my mind upon a colour, I heard, as well as saw, it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is a known, though rarely obtained, effect of <em>Cannabis indica</em>,&quot; observed the doctor. &quot;And it provoked laughter again, did it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only the muttering of the cupboard-bookcase made me laugh. It was so like a great animal trying to get itself noticed, and made me think of a performing bear--which is full of a kind of pathetic humour, you know. But this mingling of the senses produced no confusion in my brain. On the contrary, I was unusually clear-headed and experienced an intensification of consciousness, and felt marvellously alive and keen-minded.</p><p>&quot;Moreover, when I took up a pencil in obedience to an impulse to sketch--a talent not normally mine--I found that I could draw nothing but heads, nothing, in fact, but one head--always the same--the head of a dark-skinned woman, with huge and terrible features and a very drooping left eye; and so well drawn, too, that I was amazed, as you may imagine--&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the expression of the face--?&quot;</p><p>Pender hesitated a moment for words, casting about with his hands in the air and hunching his shoulders. A perceptible shudder ran over him.</p><p>&quot;What I can only describe as--<em>blackness</em>,&quot; he replied in a low tone; &quot;the face of a dark and evil soul.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You destroyed that, too?&quot; queried the doctor sharply.</p><p>&quot;No; I have kept the drawings,&quot; he said, with a laugh, and rose to get them from a drawer in the writing-desk behind him.</p><p>&quot;Here is all that remains of the pictures, you see,&quot; he added, pushing a number of loose sheets under the doctor&#39;s eyes; &quot;nothing but a few scrawly lines. That&#39;s all I found the next morning. I had really drawn no heads at all--nothing but those lines and blots and wriggles. The pictures were entirely subjective, and existed only in my mind which constructed them out of a few wild strokes of the pen. Like the altered scale of space and time it was a complete delusion. These all passed, of course, with the passing of the drug&#39;s effects. But the other thing did not pass. I mean, the presence of that Dark Soul remained with me. It is here still. It is real. I don&#39;t know how I can escape from it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is attached to the house, not to you personally. You must leave the house.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Only I cannot afford to leave the house, for my work is my sole means of support, and--well, you see, since this change I cannot even write. They are horrible, these mirthless tales I now write, with their mockery of laughter, their diabolical suggestion. Horrible? I shall go mad if this continues.&quot;</p><p>He screwed his face up and looked about the room as though he expected to see some haunting shape.</p><p>&quot;This influence in this house induced by my experiment, has killed in a flash, in a sudden stroke, the sources of my humour, and though I still go on writing funny tales--I have a certain name you know--my inspiration has dried up, and much of what I write I have to burn--yes, doctor, to burn, before any one sees it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As utterly alien to your own mind and personality?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Utterly! As though some one else had written it--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And shocking!&quot; He passed his hand over his eyes a moment and let the breath escape softly through his teeth. &quot;Yet most damnably clever in the consummate way the vile suggestions are insinuated under cover of a kind of high drollery. My stenographer left me of course--and I&#39;ve been afraid to take another--&quot;</p><p>John Silence got up and began to walk about the room leisurely without speaking; he appeared to be examining the pictures on the wall and reading the names of the books lying about. Presently he paused on the hearthrug, with his back to the fire, and turned to look his patient quietly in the eyes. Pender&#39;s face was grey and drawn; the hunted expression dominated it; the long recital had told upon him.</p><p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Pender,&quot; he said, a curious glow showing about his fine, quiet face; &quot;thank you for the sincerity and frankness of your account. But I think now there is nothing further I need ask you.&quot; He indulged in a long scrutiny of the author&#39;s haggard features drawing purposely the man&#39;s eyes to his own and then meeting them with a look of power and confidence calculated to inspire even the feeblest soul with courage. &quot;And, to begin with,&quot; he added, smiling pleasantly, &quot;let me assure you without delay that you need have no alarm, for you are no more insane or deluded than I myself am--&quot;</p><p>Pender heaved a deep sigh and tried to return the smile.</p><p>&quot;--and this is simply a case, so far as I can judge at present, of a very singular psychical invasion, and a very sinister one, too, if you perhaps understand what I mean--&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s an odd expression; you used it before, you know,&quot; said the author wearily, yet eagerly listening to every word of the diagnosis, and deeply touched by the intelligent sympathy which did not at once indicate the lunatic asylum.</p><p>&quot;Possibly,&quot; returned the other, &quot;and an odd affliction, too, you&#39;ll allow, yet one not unknown to the nations of antiquity, nor to those moderns, perhaps, who recognise the freedom of action under certain pathogenic conditions between this world and another.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And you think,&quot; asked Pender hastily, &quot;that it is all primarily due to the <em>Cannabis</em>? There is nothing radically amiss with myself--nothing incurable, or--?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Due entirely to the overdose,&quot; Dr. Silence replied emphatically, &quot;to the drug&#39;s direct action upon your psychical being. It rendered you ultra-sensitive and made you respond to an increased rate of vibration. And, let me tell you, Mr. Pender, that your experiment might have had results far more dire. It has brought you into touch with a somewhat singular class of Invisible, but of one, I think, chiefly human in character. You might, however, just as easily have been drawn out of human range altogether, and the results of such a contingency would have been exceedingly terrible. Indeed, you would not now be here to tell the tale. I need not alarm you on that score, but mention it as a warning you will not misunderstand or underrate after what you have been through.</p><p>&quot;You look puzzled. You do not quite gather what I am driving at; and it is not to be expected that you should, for you, I suppose, are the nominal Christian with the nominal Christian&#39;s lofty standard of ethics, and his utter ignorance of spiritual possibilities. Beyond a somewhat childish understanding of &#39;spiritual wickedness in high places,&#39; you probably have no conception of what is possible once you break-down the slender gulf that is mercifully fixed between you and that Outer World. But my studies and training have taken me far outside these orthodox trips, and I have made experiments that I could scarcely speak to you about in language that would be intelligible to you.&quot;</p><p>He paused a moment to note the breathless interest of Pender&#39;s face and manner. Every word he uttered was calculated; he knew exactly the value and effect of the emotions he desired to waken in the heart of the afflicted being before him.</p><p>&quot;And from certain knowledge I have gained through various experiences,&quot; he continued calmly, &quot;I can diagnose your case as I said before to be one of psychical invasion.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the nature of this--er--invasion?&quot; stammered the bewildered writer of humorous tales.</p><p>&quot;There is no reason why I should not say at once that I do not yet quite know,&quot; replied Dr. Silence. &quot;I may first have to make one or two experiments--&quot;</p><p>&quot;On me?&quot; gasped Pender, catching his breath.</p><p>&quot;Not exactly,&quot; the doctor said, with a grave smile, &quot;but with your assistance, perhaps. I shall want to test the conditions of the house--to ascertain, impossible, the character of the forces, of this strange personality that has been haunting you--&quot;</p><p>&quot;At present you have no idea exactly who--what--why--&quot; asked the other in a wild flurry of interest, dread and amazement.</p><p>&quot;I have a very good idea, but no proof rather,&quot; returned the doctor. &quot;The effects of the drug in altering the scale of time and space, and merging the senses have nothing primarily to do with the invasion. They come to any one who is fool enough to take an experimental dose. It is the other features of your case that are unusual. You see, you are now in touch with certain violent emotions, desires, purposes, still active in this house, that were produced in the past by some powerful and evil personality that lived here. How long ago, or why they still persist so forcibly, I cannot positively say. But I should judge that they are merely forces acting automatically with the momentum of their terrific original impetus.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not directed by a living being, a conscious will, you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Possibly not--but none the less dangerous on that account, and more difficult to deal with. I cannot explain to you in a few minutes the nature of such things, for you have not made the studies that would enable you to follow me; but I have reason to believe that on the dissolution at death of a human being, its forces may still persist and continue to act in a blind, unconscious fashion. As a rule they speedily dissipate themselves, but in the case of a very powerful personality they may last a long time. And, in some cases--of which I incline to think this is one--these forces may coalesce with certain non-human entities who thus continue their life indefinitely and increase their strength to an unbelievable degree. If the original personality was evil, the beings attracted to the left-over forces will also be evil. In this case, I think there has been an unusual and dreadful aggrandisement of the thoughts and purposes left behind long ago by a woman of consummate wickedness and great personal power of character and intellect. Now, do you begin to see what I am driving at a little?&quot;</p><p>Pender stared fixedly at his companion, plain horror showing in his eyes. But he found nothing to say, and the doctor continued--</p><p>&quot;In your case, predisposed by the action of the drug, you have experienced the rush of these forces in undiluted strength. They wholly obliterate in you the sense of humour, fancy, imagination,--all that makes for cheerfulness and hope. They seek, though perhaps automatically only, to oust your own thoughts and establish themselves in their place. You are the victim of a psychical invasion. At the same time, you have become clairvoyant in the true sense. You are also a clairvoyant victim.&quot;</p><p>Pender mopped his face and sighed. He left his chair and went over to the fireplace to warm himself.</p><p>&quot;You must think me a quack to talk like this, or a madman,&quot; laughed Dr. Silence. &quot;But never mind that. I have come to help you, and I can help you if you will do what I tell you. It is very simple: you must leave this house at once. Oh, never mind the difficulties; we will deal with those together. I can place another house at your disposal, or I would take the lease here off your hands, and later have it pulled down. Your case interests me greatly, and I mean to see you through, so that you have no anxiety, and can drop back into your old groove of work tomorrow! The drug has provided you, and therefore me, with a shortcut to a very interesting experience. I am grateful to you.&quot;</p><p>The author poked the fire vigorously, emotion rising in him like a tide. He glanced towards the door nervously.</p><p>&quot;There is no need to alarm your wife or to tell her the details of our conversation,&quot; pursued the other quietly. &quot;Let her know that you will soon be in possession again of your sense of humour and your health, and explain that I am lending you another house for six months. Meanwhile I may have the right to use this house for a night or two for my experiment. Is that understood between us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can only thank you from the bottom of my heart,&quot; stammered Pender, unable to find words to express his gratitude.</p><p>Then he hesitated for a moment, searching the doctor&#39;s face anxiously.</p><p>&quot;And your experiment with the house?&quot; he said at length.</p><p>&quot;Of the simplest character, my dear Mr. Pender. Although I am myself an artificially trained psychic, and consequently aware of the presence of discarnate entities as a rule, I have so far felt nothing here at all. This makes me sure that the forces acting here are of an unusual description. What I propose to do is to make an experiment with a view of drawing out this evil, coaxing it from its lair, so to speak, in order that it may <em>exhaust itself through me</em> and become dissipated for ever. I have already been inoculated,&quot; he added; &quot;I consider myself to be immune.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heavens above!&quot; gasped the author, collapsing on to a chair.</p><p>&quot;Hell beneath! might be a more appropriate exclamation,&quot; the doctor laughed. &quot;But, seriously, Mr. Pender, this is what I propose to do--with your permission.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, of course,&quot; cried the other, &quot;you have my permission and my best wishes for success. I can see no possible objection, but--&quot;</p><p>&quot;But what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I pray to Heaven you will not undertake this experiment alone, will you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, dear, no; not alone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You will take a companion with good nerves, and reliable in case of disaster, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall bring two companions,&quot; the doctor said.</p><p>&quot;Ah, that&#39;s better. I feel easier. I am sure you must have among your acquaintances men who--&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall not think of bringing men, Mr. Pender.&quot;</p><p>The other looked up sharply.</p><p>&quot;No, or women either; or children.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t understand. Who will you bring, then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Animals,&quot; explained the doctor, unable to prevent a smile at his companion&#39;s expression of surprise--&quot;two animals, a cat and a dog.&quot;</p><p>Pender stared as if his eyes would drop out upon the floor, and then led the way without another word into the adjoining room where his wife was awaiting them for tea.</p><p>II</p><p>A few days later the humorist and his wife, with minds greatly relieved, moved into a small furnished house placed at their free disposal in another part of London; and John Silence, intent upon his approaching experiment, made ready to spend a night in the empty house on the top of Putney Hill. Only two rooms were prepared for occupation: the study on the ground floor and the bedroom immediately above it; all other doors were to be locked, and no servant was to be left in the house. The motor had orders to call for him at nine o&#39;clock the following morning.</p><p>And, meanwhile, his secretary had instructions to look up the past history and associations of the place, and learn everything he could concerning the character of former occupants, recent or remote.</p><p>The animals, by whose sensitiveness he intended to test any unusual conditions in the atmosphere of the building, Dr. Silence selected with care and judgment. He believed (and had already made curious experiments to prove it) that animals were more often, and more truly, clairvoyant than human beings. Many of them, he felt convinced, possessed powers of perception far superior to that mere keenness of the senses common to all dwellers in the wilds where the senses grow specially alert; they had what he termed &quot;animal clairvoyance,&quot; and from his experiments with horses, dogs, cats, and even birds, he had drawn certain deductions, which, however, need not be referred to in detail here.</p><p>Cats, in particular, he believed, were almost continuously conscious of a larger field of vision, too detailed even for a photographic camera, and quite beyond the reach of normal human organs. He had, further, observed that while dogs were usually terrified in the presence of such phenomena, cats on the other hand were soothed and satisfied. They welcomed manifestations as something belonging peculiarly to their own region.</p><p>He selected his animals, therefore, with wisdom so that they might afford a differing test, each in its own way, and that one should not merely communicate its own excitement to the other. He took a dog and a cat.</p><p>The cat he chose, now full grown, had lived with him since kittenhood, a kittenhood of perplexing sweetness and audacious mischief. Wayward it was and fanciful, ever playing its own mysterious games in the corners of the room, jumping at invisible nothings, leaping sideways into the air and falling with tiny moccasined feet on to another part of the carpet, yet with an air of dignified earnestness which showed that the performance was necessary to its own well-being, and not done merely to impress a stupid human audience. In the middle of elaborate washing it would look up, startled, as though to stare at the approach of some Invisible, cocking its little head sideways and putting out a velvet pad to inspect cautiously. Then it would get absent-minded, and stare with equal intentness in another direction (just to confuse the onlookers), and suddenly go on furiously washing its body again, but in quite a new place. Except for a white patch on its breast it was coal black. And its name was--Smoke.</p><p>&quot;Smoke&quot; described its temperament as well as its appearance. Its movements, its individuality, its posing as a little furry mass of concealed mysteries, its elfin-like elusiveness, all combined to justify its name; and a subtle painter might have pictured it as a wisp of floating smoke, the fire below betraying itself at two points only--the glowing eyes.</p><p>All its forces ran to intelligence--secret intelligence, the wordless incalculable intuition of the Cat. It was, indeed, <em>the</em> cat for the business in hand.</p><p>The selection of the dog was not so simple, for the doctor owned many; but after much deliberation he chose a collie, called Flame from his yellow coat. True, it was a trifle old, and stiff in the joints, and even beginning to grow deaf, but, on the other hand, it was a very particular friend of Smoke&#39;s, and had fathered it from kittenhood upwards so that a subtle understanding existed between them. It was this that turned the balance in its favour, this and its courage. Moreover, though good-tempered, it was a terrible fighter, and its anger when provoked by a righteous cause was a fury of fire, and irresistible.</p><p>It had come to him quite young, straight from the shepherd, with the air of the hills yet in its nostrils, and was then little more than skin and bones and teeth. For a collie it was sturdily built, its nose blunter than most, its yellow hair stiff rather than silky, and it had full eyes, unlike the slit eyes of its breed. Only its master could touch it, for it ignored strangers, and despised their pattings--when any dared to pat it. There was something patriarchal about the old beast. He was in earnest, and went through life with tremendous energy and big things in view, as though he had the reputation of his whole race to uphold. And to watch him fighting against odds was to understand why he was terrible.</p><p>In his relations with Smoke he was always absurdly gentle; also he was fatherly; and at the same time betrayed a certain diffidence or shyness. He recognised that Smoke called for strong yet respectful management. The cat&#39;s circuitous methods puzzled him, and his elaborate pretences perhaps shocked the dog&#39;s liking for direct, undisguised action. Yet, while he failed to comprehend these tortuous feline mysteries, he was never contemptuous or condescending; and he presided over the safety of his furry black friend somewhat as a father, loving, but intuitive, might superintend the vagaries of a wayward and talented child. And, in return, Smoke rewarded him with exhibitions of fascinating and audacious mischief.</p><p>And these brief descriptions of their characters are necessary for the proper understanding of what subsequently took place.</p><p>With Smoke sleeping in the folds of his fur coat, and the collie lying watchful on the seat opposite, John Silence went down in his motor after dinner on the night of November 15th.</p><p>And the fog was so dense that they were obliged to travel at quarter speed the entire way.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>It was after ten o&#39;clock when he dismissed the motor and entered the dingy little house with the latchkey provided by Pender. He found the hall gas turned low, and a fire in the study. Books and food had also been placed ready by the servant according to instructions. Coils of fog rushed in after him through the open door and filled the hall and passage with its cold discomfort.</p><p>The first thing Dr. Silence did was to lock up Smoke in the study with a saucer of milk before the fire, and then make a search of the house with Flame. The dog ran cheerfully behind him all the way while he tried the doors of the other rooms to make sure they were locked. He nosed about into corners and made little excursions on his own account. His manner was expectant. He knew there must be something unusual about the proceeding, because it was contrary to the habits of his whole life not to be asleep at this hour on the mat in front of the fire. He kept looking up into his master&#39;s face, as door after door was tried, with an expression of intelligent sympathy, but at the same time a certain air of disapproval. Yet everything his master did was good in his eyes, and he betrayed as little impatience as possible with all this unnecessary journeying to and fro. If the doctor was pleased to play this sort of game at such an hour of the night, it was surely not for him to object. So he played it, too; and was very busy and earnest about it into the bargain.</p><p>After an uneventful search they came down again to the study, and here Dr. Silence discovered Smoke washing his face calmly in front of the fire. The saucer of milk was licked dry and clean; the preliminary examination that cats always make in new surroundings had evidently been satisfactorily concluded. He drew an arm-chair up to the fire, stirred the coals into a blaze, arranged the table and lamp to his satisfaction for reading, and then prepared surreptitiously to watch the animals. He wished to observe them carefully without their being aware of it.</p><p>Now, in spite of their respective ages, it was the regular custom of these two to play together every night before sleep. Smoke always made the advances, beginning with grave impudence to pat the dog&#39;s tail, and Flame played cumbrously, with condescension. It was his duty, rather than pleasure; he was glad when it was over, and sometimes he was very determined and refused to play at all.</p><p>And this night was one of the occasions on which he was firm.</p><p>The doctor, looking cautiously over the top of his book, watched the cat begin the performance. It started by gazing with an innocent expression at the dog where he lay with nose on paws and eyes wide open in the middle of the floor. Then it got up and made as though it meant to walk to the door, going deliberately and very softly. Flame&#39;s eyes followed it until it was beyond the range of sight, and then the cat turned sharply and began patting his tail tentatively with one paw. The tail moved slightly in reply, and Smoke changed paws and tapped it again. The dog, however, did not rise to play as was his wont, and the cat fell to parting it briskly with both paws. Flame still lay motionless.</p><p>This puzzled and bored the cat, and it went round and stared hard into its friend&#39;s face to see what was the matter. Perhaps some inarticulate message flashed from the dog&#39;s eyes into its own little brain, making it understand that the programme for the night had better not begin with play. Perhaps it only realised that its friend was immovable. But, whatever the reason, its usual persistence thenceforward deserted it, and it made no further attempts at persuasion. Smoke yielded at once to the dog&#39;s mood; it sat down where it was and began to wash.</p><p>But the washing, the doctor noted, was by no means its real purpose; it only used it to mask something else; it stopped at the most busy and furious moments and began to stare about the room. Its thoughts wandered absurdly. It peered intently at the curtains; at the shadowy corners; at empty space above; leaving its body in curiously awkward positions for whole minutes together. Then it turned sharply and stared with a sudden signal of intelligence at the dog, and Flame at once rose somewhat stiffly to his feet and began to wander aimlessly and restlessly to and fro about the floor. Smoke followed him, padding quietly at his heels. Between them they made what seemed to be a deliberate search of the room.</p><p>And, here, as he watched them, noting carefully every detail of the performance over the top of his book, yet making no effort to interfere, it seemed to the doctor that the first beginnings of a faint distress betrayed themselves in the collie, and in the cat the stirrings of a vague excitement.</p><p>He observed them closely. The fog was thick in the air, and the tobacco smoke from his pipe added to its density; the furniture at the far end stood mistily, and where the shadows congregated in hanging clouds under the ceiling, it was difficult to see clearly at all; the lamplight only reached to a level of five feet from the floor, above which came layers of comparative darkness, so that the room appeared twice as lofty as it actually was. By means of the lamp and the fire, however, the carpet was everywhere clearly visible.</p><p>The animals made their silent tour of the floor, sometimes the dog leading, sometimes the cat; occasionally they looked at one another as though exchanging signals; and once or twice, in spite of the limited space, he lost sight of one or other among the fog and the shadows. Their curiosity, it appeared to him, was something more than the excitement lurking in the unknown territory of a strange room; yet, so far, it was impossible to test this, and he purposely kept his mind quietly receptive lest the smallest mental excitement on his part should communicate itself to the animals and thus destroy the value of their independent behaviour.</p><p>They made a very thorough journey, leaving no piece of furniture unexamined, or unsmelt. Flame led the way, walking slowly with lowered head, and Smoke followed demurely at his heels, making a transparent pretence of not being interested, yet missing nothing. And, at length, they returned, the old collie first, and came to rest on the mat before the fire. Flame rested his muzzle on his master&#39;s knee, smiling beatifically while he patted the yellow head and spoke his name; and Smoke, coming a little later, pretending he came by chance, looked from the empty saucer to his face, lapped up the milk when it was given him to the last drop, and then sprang upon his knees and curled round for the sleep it had fully earned and intended to enjoy.</p><p>Silence descended upon the room. Only the breathing of the dog upon the mat came through the deep stillness, like the pulse of time marking the minutes; and the steady drip, drip of the fog outside upon the window-ledges dismally testified to the inclemency of the night beyond. And the soft crashings of the coals as the fire settled down into the grate became less and less audible as the fire sank and the flames resigned their fierceness.</p><p>It was now well after eleven o&#39;clock, and Dr. Silence devoted himself again to his book. He read the words on the printed page and took in their meaning superficially, yet without starting into life the correlations of thought and suggestions that should accompany interesting reading. Underneath, all the while, his mental energies were absorbed in watching, listening, waiting for what might come. He was not over-sanguine himself, yet he did not wish to be taken by surprise. Moreover, the animals, his sensitive barometers, had incontinently gone to sleep.</p><p>After reading a dozen pages, however, he realised that his mind was really occupied in reviewing the features of Pender&#39;s extraordinary story, and that it was no longer necessary to steady his imagination by studying the dull paragraphs detailed in the pages before him. He laid down his book accordingly, and allowed his thoughts to dwell upon the features of the Case. Speculations as to the meaning, however, he rigorously suppressed, knowing that such thoughts would act upon his imagination like wind upon the glowing embers of a fire.</p><p>As the night wore on the silence grew deeper and deeper, and only at rare intervals he heard the sound of wheels on the main road a hundred yards away, where the horses went at a walking pace owing to the density of the fog. The echo of pedestrian footsteps no longer reached him, the clamour of occasional voices no longer came down the side street. The night, muffled by fog, shrouded by veils of ultimate mystery, hung about the haunted villa like a doom. Nothing in the house stirred. Stillness, in a thick blanket, lay over the upper storeys. Only the mist in the room grew more dense, he thought, and the damp cold more penetrating. Certainly, from time to time, he shivered.</p><p>The collie, now deep in slumber, moved occasionally,--grunted, sighed, or twitched his legs in dreams. Smoke lay on his knees, a pool of warm, black fur, only the closest observation detecting the movement of his sleek sides. It was difficult to distinguish exactly where his head and body joined in that circle of glistening hair; only a black satin nose and a tiny tip of pink tongue betrayed the secret.</p><p>Dr. Silence watched him, and felt comfortable. The collie&#39;s breathing was soothing. The fire was well built, and would burn for another two hours without attention. He was not conscious of the least nervousness. He particularly wished to remain in his ordinary and normal state of mind, and to force nothing. If sleep came naturally, he would let it come--and even welcome it. The coldness of the room, when the fire died down later, would be sure to wake him again; and it would then be time enough to carry these sleeping barometers up to bed. From various psychic premonitions he knew quite well that the night would not pass without adventure; but he did not wish to force its arrival; and he wished to remain normal, and let the animals remain normal, so that, when it came, it would be unattended by excitement or by any straining of the attention. Many experiments had made him wise. And, for the rest, he had no fear.</p><p>Accordingly, after a time, he did fall asleep as he had expected, and the last thing he remembered, before oblivion slipped up over his eyes like soft wool, was the picture of Flame stretching all four legs at once, and sighing noisily as he sought a more comfortable position for his paws and muzzle upon the mat.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>It was a good deal later when he became aware that a weight lay upon his chest, and that something was pencilling over his face and mouth. A soft touch on the cheek woke him. Something was patting him.</p><p>He sat up with a jerk, and found himself staring straight into a pair of brilliant eyes, half green, half black. Smoke&#39;s face lay level with his own; and the cat had climbed up with its front paws upon his chest.</p><p>The lamp had burned low and the fire was nearly out, yet Dr. Silence saw in a moment that the cat was in an excited state. It kneaded with its front paws into his chest, shifting from one to the other. He felt them prodding against him. It lifted a leg very carefully and patted his cheek gingerly. Its fur, he saw, was standing ridgewise upon its back; the ears were flattened back somewhat; the tail was switching sharply. The cat, of course, had wakened him with a purpose, and the instant he realised this, he set it upon the arm of the chair and sprang up with a quick turn to face the empty room behind him. By some curious instinct, his arms of their own accord assumed an attitude of defence in front of him, as though to ward off something that threatened his safety. Yet nothing was visible. Only shapes of fog hung about rather heavily in the air, moving slightly to and fro.</p><p>His mind was now fully alert, and the last vestiges of sleep gone. He turned the lamp higher and peered about him. Two things he became aware of at once: one, that Smoke, while excited, was <em>pleasurably</em> excited; the other, that the collie was no longer visible upon the mat at his feet. He had crept away to the corner of the wall farthest from the window, and lay watching the room with wide-open eyes, in which lurked plainly something of alarm.</p><p>Something in the dog&#39;s behaviour instantly struck Dr. Silence as unusual, and, calling him by name, he moved across to pat him. Flame got up, wagged his tail, and came over slowly to the rug, uttering a low sound that was half growl, half whine. He was evidently perturbed about something, and his master was proceeding to administer comfort when his attention was suddenly drawn to the antics of his other four-footed companion, the cat.</p><p>And what he saw filled him with something like amazement.</p><p>Smoke had jumped down from the back of the arm-chair and now occupied the middle of the carpet, where, with tail erect and legs stiff as ramrods, it was steadily pacing backwards and forwards in a narrow space, uttering, as it did so, those curious little guttural sounds of pleasure that only an animal of the feline species knows how to make expressive of supreme happiness. Its stiffened legs and arched back made it appear larger than usual, and the black visage wore a smile of beatific joy. Its eyes blazed magnificently; it was in an ecstasy.</p><p>At the end of every few paces it turned sharply and stalked back again along the same line, padding softly, and purring like a roll of little muffled drums. It behaved precisely as though it were rubbing against the ankles of some one who remained invisible. A thrill ran down the doctor&#39;s spine as he stood and stared. His experiment was growing interesting at last.</p><p>He called the collie&#39;s attention to his friend&#39;s performance to see whether he too was aware of anything standing there upon the carpet, and the dog&#39;s behaviour was significant and corroborative. He came as far as his master&#39;s knees and then stopped dead, refusing to investigate closely. In vain Dr. Silence urged him; he wagged his tail, whined a little, and stood in a half-crouching attitude, staring alternately at the cat and at his master&#39;s face. He was, apparently, both puzzled and alarmed, and the whine went deeper and deeper down into his throat till it changed into an ugly snarl of awakening anger.</p><p>Then the doctor called to him in a tone of command he had never known to be disregarded; but still the dog, though springing up in response, declined to move nearer. He made tentative motions, pranced a little like a dog about to take to water, pretended to bark, and ran to and fro on the carpet. So far there was no actual fear in his manner, but he was uneasy and anxious, and nothing would induce him to go within touching distance of the walking cat. Once he made a complete circuit, but always carefully out of reach; and in the end he returned to his master&#39;s legs and rubbed vigorously against him. Flame did not like the performance at all: that much was quite clear.</p><p>For several minutes John Silence watched the performance of the cat with profound attention and without interfering. Then he called to the animal by name.</p><p>&quot;Smoke, you mysterious beastie, what in the world are you about?&quot; he said, in a coaxing tone.</p><p>The cat looked up at him for a moment, smiling in its ecstasy, blinking its eyes, but too happy to pause. He spoke to it again. He called to it several times, and each time it turned upon him its blazing eyes, drunk with inner delight, opening and shutting its lips, its body large and rigid with excitement. Yet it never for one instant paused in its short journeys to and fro.</p><p>He noted exactly what it did: it walked, he saw, the same number of paces each time, some six or seven steps, and then it turned sharply and retraced them. By the pattern of the great roses in the carpet he measured it. It kept to the same direction and the same line. It behaved precisely as though it were rubbing against something solid. Undoubtedly, there was something standing there on that strip of carpet, something invisible to the doctor, something that alarmed the dog, yet caused the cat unspeakable pleasure.</p><p>&quot;Smokie!&quot; he called again, &quot;Smokie, you black mystery, what is it excites you so?&quot;</p><p>Again the cat looked up at him for a brief second, and then continued its sentry-walk, blissfully happy, intensely preoccupied. And, for an instant, as he watched it, the doctor was aware that a faint uneasiness stirred in the depths of his own being, focusing itself for the moment upon this curious behaviour of the uncanny creature before him.</p><p>There rose in him quite a new realisation of the mystery connected with the whole feline tribe, but especially with that common member of it, the domestic cat--their hidden lives, their strange aloofness, their incalculable subtlety. How utterly remote from anything that human beings understood lay the sources of their elusive activities. As he watched the indescribable bearing of the little creature mincing along the strip of carpet under his eyes, coquetting with the powers of darkness, welcoming, maybe, some fearsome visitor, there stirred in his heart a feeling strangely akin to awe. Its indifference to human kind, its serene superiority to the obvious, struck him forcibly with fresh meaning; so remote, so inaccessible seemed the secret purposes of its real life, so alien to the blundering honesty of other animals. Its absolute poise of bearing brought into his mind the opium-eater&#39;s words that &quot;no dignity is perfect which does not at some point ally itself with the mysterious&quot;; and he became suddenly aware that the presence of the dog in this foggy, haunted room on the top of Putney Hill was uncommonly welcome to him. He was glad to feel that Flame&#39;s dependable personality was with him. The savage growling at his heels was a pleasant sound. He was glad to hear it. That marching cat made him uneasy.</p><p>Finding that Smoke paid no further attention to his words, the doctor decided upon action. Would it rub against his leg, too? He would take it by surprise and see.</p><p>He stepped quickly forward and placed himself upon the exact strip of carpet where it walked.</p><p>But no cat is ever taken by surprise! The moment he occupied the space of the Intruder, setting his feet on the woven roses midway in the line of travel, Smoke suddenly stopped purring and sat down. If lifted up its face with the most innocent stare imaginable of its green eyes. He could have sworn it laughed. It was a perfect child again. In a single second it had resumed its simple, domestic manner; and it gazed at him in such a way that he almost felt Smoke was the normal being, and <em>his</em> was the eccentric behaviour that was being watched. It was consummate, the manner in which it brought about this change so easily and so quickly.</p><p>&quot;Superb little actor!&quot; he laughed in spite of himself, and stooped to stroke the shining black back. But, in a flash, as he touched its fur, the cat turned and spat at him viciously, striking at his hand with one paw. Then, with a hurried scutter of feet, it shot like a shadow across the floor and a moment later was calmly sitting over by the window-curtains washing its face as though nothing interested it in the whole world but the cleanness of its cheeks and whiskers.</p><p>John Silence straightened himself up and drew a long breath. He realised that the performance was temporarily at an end. The collie, meanwhile, who had watched the whole proceeding with marked disapproval, had now lain down again upon the mat by the fire, no longer growling. It seemed to the doctor just as though something that had entered the room while he slept, alarming the dog, yet bringing happiness to the cat, had now gone out again, leaving all as it was before. Whatever it was that excited its blissful attentions had retreated for the moment.</p><p>He realised this intuitively. Smoke evidently realised it, too, for presently he deigned to march back to the fireplace and jump upon his master&#39;s knees. Dr. Silence, patient and determined, settled down once more to his book. The animals soon slept; the fire blazed cheerfully; and the cold fog from outside poured into the room through every available chink and crannie.</p><p>For a long time silence and peace reigned in the room and Dr. Silence availed himself of the quietness to make careful notes of what had happened. He entered for future use in other cases an exhaustive analysis of what he had observed, especially with regard to the effect upon the two animals. It is impossible here, nor would it be intelligible to the reader unversed in the knowledge of the region known to a scientifically trained psychic like Dr. Silence, to detail these observations. But to him it was clear, up to a certain point--for the rest he must still wait and watch. So far, at least, he realised that while he slept in the chair--that is, while his will was dormant--the room had suffered intrusion from what he recognised as an intensely active Force, and might later be forced to acknowledge as something more than merely a blind force, namely, a distinct personality.</p><p>So far it had affected himself scarcely at all, but had acted directly upon the simpler organisms of the animals. It stimulated keenly the centres of the cat&#39;s psychic being, inducing a state of instant happiness (intensifying its consciousness probably in the same way a drug or stimulant intensifies that of a human being); whereas it alarmed the less sensitive dog, causing it to feel a vague apprehension and distress.</p><p>His own sudden action and exhibition of energy had served to disperse it temporarily, yet he felt convinced--the indications were not lacking even while he sat there making notes--that it still remained near to him, conditionally if not spatially, and was, as it were, gathering force for a second attack.</p><p>And, further, he intuitively understood that the relations between the two animals had undergone a subtle change: that the cat had become immeasurably superior, confident, sure of itself in its own peculiar region, whereas Flame had been weakened by an attack he could not comprehend and knew not how to reply to. Though not yet afraid, he was defiant--ready to act against a fear that he felt to be approaching. He was no longer fatherly and protective towards the cat. Smoke held the key to the situation; and both he and the cat knew it.</p><p>Thus, as the minutes passed, John Silence sat and waited, keenly on the alert, wondering how soon the attack would be renewed, and at what point it would be diverted from the animals and directed upon himself.</p><p>The book lay on the floor beside him, his notes were complete. With one hand on the cat&#39;s fur, and the dog&#39;s front paws resting against his feet, the three of them dozed comfortably before the hot fire while the night wore on and the silence deepened towards midnight.</p><p>It was well after one o&#39;clock in the morning when Dr. Silence turned the lamp out and lighted the candle preparatory to going up to bed. Then Smoke suddenly woke with a loud sharp purr and sat up. It neither stretched, washed nor turned: it listened. And the doctor, watching it, realised that a certain indefinable change had come about that very moment in the room. A swift readjustment of the forces within the four walls had taken place--a new disposition of their personal equations. The balance was destroyed, the former harmony gone. Smoke, most sensitive of barometers, had been the first to feel it, but the dog was not slow to follow suit, for on looking down he noted that Flame was no longer asleep. He was lying with eyes wide open, and that same instant he sat up on his great haunches and began to growl.</p><p>Dr. Silence was in the act of taking the matches to re-light the lamp when an audible movement in the room behind him made him pause. Smoke leaped down from his knee and moved forward a few paces across the carpet. Then it stopped and stared fixedly; and the doctor stood up on the rug to watch.</p><p>As he rose the sound was repeated, and he discovered that it was not in the room as he first thought, but outside, and that it came from more directions than one. There was a rushing, sweeping noise against the window-panes, and simultaneously a sound of something brushing against the door--out in the hall. Smoke advanced sedately across the carpet, twitching his tail, and sat down within a foot of the door. The influence that had destroyed the harmonious conditions of the room had apparently moved in advance of its cause. Clearly, something was about to happen.</p><p>For the first time that night John Silence hesitated; the thought of that dark narrow hall-way, choked with fog, and destitute of human comfort, was unpleasant. He became aware of a faint creeping of his flesh. He knew, of course, that the actual opening of the door was not necessary to the invasion of the room that was about to take place, since neither doors nor windows, nor any other solid barriers could interpose an obstacle to what was seeking entrance. Yet the opening of the door would be significant and symbolic, and he distinctly shrank from it.</p><p>But for a moment only. Smoke, turning with a show of impatience, recalled him to his purpose, and he moved past the sitting, watching creature, and deliberately opened the door to its full width.</p><p>What subsequently happened, happened in the feeble and flickering light of the solitary candle on the mantlepiece.</p><p>Through the opened door he saw the hall, dimly lit and thick with fog. Nothing, of course, was visible--nothing but the hat-stand, the African spears in dark lines upon the wall and the high-backed wooden chair standing grotesquely underneath on the oilcloth floor. For one instant the fog seemed to move and thicken oddly; but he set that down to the score of the imagination. The door had opened upon nothing.</p><p>Yet Smoke apparently thought otherwise, and the deep growling of the collie from the mat at the back of the room seemed to confirm his judgment.</p><p>For, proud and self-possessed, the cat had again risen to his feet, and having advanced to the door, was now ushering some one slowly into the room. Nothing could have been more evident. He paced from side to side, bowing his little head with great <em>empressement</em> and holding his stiffened tail aloft like a flag-staff. He turned this way and that, mincing to and fro, and showing signs of supreme satisfaction. He was in his element. He welcomed the intrusion, and apparently reckoned that his companions, the doctor and the dog, would welcome it likewise.</p><p>The Intruder had returned for a second attack.</p><p>Dr. Silence moved slowly backwards and took up his position on the hearthrug, keying himself up to a condition of concentrated attention.</p><p>He noted that Flame stood beside him, facing the room, with body motionless, and head moving swiftly from side to side with a curious swaying movement. His eyes were wide open, his back rigid, his neck and jaws thrust forward, his legs tense and ready to leap. Savage, ready for attack or defence, yet dreadfully puzzled and perhaps already a little cowed, he stood and stared, the hair on his spine and sides positively bristling outwards as though a wind played through it. In the dim firelight he looked like a great yellow-haired wolf, silent, eyes shooting dark fire, exceedingly formidable. It was Flame, the terrible.</p><p>Smoke, meanwhile, advanced from the door towards the middle of the room, adopting the very slow pace of an invisible companion. A few feet away it stopped and began to smile and blink its eyes. There was something deliberately coaxing in its attitude as it stood there undecided on the carpet, clearly wishing to effect some sort of introduction between the Intruder and its canine friend and ally. It assumed its most winning manners, purring, smiling, looking persuasively from one to the other, and making quick tentative steps first in one direction and then in the other. There had always existed such perfect understanding between them in everything. Surely Flame would appreciate Smoke&#39;s intention now, and acquiesce.</p><p>But the old collie made no advances. He bared his teeth, lifting his lips till the gums showed, and stood stockstill with fixed eyes and heaving sides. The doctor moved a little farther back, watching intently the smallest movement, and it was just then he divined suddenly from the cat&#39;s behaviour and attitude that it was not only a single companion it had ushered into the room, but <em>several</em>. It kept crossing over from one to the other, looking up at each in turn. It sought to win over the dog to friendliness with them all. The original Intruder had come back with reinforcements. And at the same time he further realised that the Intruder was something more than a blindly acting force, impersonal though destructive. It was a Personality, and moreover a great personality. And it was accompanied for the purposes of assistance by a host of other personalities, minor in degree, but similar in kind.</p><p>He braced himself in the corner against the mantelpiece and waited, his whole being roused to defence, for he was now fully aware that the attack had spread to include himself as well as the animals, and he must be on the alert. He strained his eyes through the foggy atmosphere, trying in vain to see what the cat and dog saw; but the candlelight threw an uncertain and flickering light across the room and his eyes discerned nothing. On the floor Smoke moved softly in front of him like a black shadow, his eyes gleaming as he turned his head, still trying with many insinuating gestures and much purring to bring about the introductions he desired.</p><p>But it was all in vain. Flame stood riveted to one spot, motionless as a figure carved in stone.</p><p>Some minutes passed, during which only the cat moved, and then there came a sharp change. Flame began to back towards the wall. He moved his head from side to side as he went, sometimes turning to snap at something almost behind him. They were advancing upon him, trying to surround him. His distress became very marked from now onwards, and it seemed to the doctor that his anger merged into genuine terror and became overwhelmed by it. The savage growl sounded perilously like a whine, and more than once he tried to dive past his master&#39;s legs, as though hunting for a way of escape. He was trying to avoid something that everywhere blocked the way.</p><p>This terror of the indomitable fighter impressed the doctor enormously; yet also painfully; stirring his impatience; for he had never before seen the dog show signs of giving in, and it distressed him to witness it. He knew, however, that he was not giving in easily, and understood that it was really impossible for him to gauge the animal&#39;s sensations properly at all. What Flame felt, and saw, must be terrible indeed to turn him all at once into a coward. He faced something that made him afraid of more than his life merely. The doctor spoke a few quick words of encouragement to him, and stroked the bristling hair. But without much success. The collie seemed already beyond the reach of comfort such as that, and the collapse of the old dog followed indeed very speedily after this.</p><p>And Smoke, meanwhile, remained behind, watching the advance, but not joining in it; sitting, pleased and expectant, considering that all was going well and as it wished. It was kneading on the carpet with its front paws--slowly, laboriously, as though its feet were dipped in treacle. The sound its claws made as they caught in the threads was distinctly audible. It was still smiling, blinking, purring.</p><p>Suddenly the collie uttered a poignant short bark and leaped heavily to one side. His bared teeth traced a line of whiteness through the gloom. The next instant he dashed past his master&#39;s legs, almost upsetting his balance, and shot out into the room, where he went blundering wildly against walls and furniture. But that bark was significant; the doctor had heard it before and knew what it meant: for it was the cry of the fighter against odds and it meant that the old beast had found his courage again. Possibly it was only the courage of despair, but at any rate the fighting would be terrific. And Dr. Silence understood, too, that he dared not interfere. Flame must fight his own enemies in his own way.</p><p>But the cat, too, had heard that dreadful bark; and it, too, had understood. This was more than it had bargained for. Across the dim shadows of that haunted room there must have passed some secret signal of distress between the animals. Smoke stood up and looked swiftly about him. He uttered a piteous meow and trotted smartly away into the greater darkness by the windows. What his object was only those endowed with the spirit-like intelligence of cats might know. But, at any rate, he had at last ranged himself on the side of his friend. And the little beast meant business.</p><p>At the same moment the collie managed to gain the door. The doctor saw him rush through into the hall like a flash of yellow light. He shot across the oilcloth, and tore up the stairs, but in another second he appeared again, flying down the steps and landing at the bottom in a tumbling heap, whining, cringing, terrified. The doctor saw him slink back into the room again and crawl round by the wall towards the cat. Was, then, even the staircase occupied? Did <em>They</em> stand also in the hall? Was the whole house crowded from floor to ceiling?</p><p>The thought came to add to the keen distress he felt at the sight of the collie&#39;s discomfiture. And, indeed, his own personal distress had increased in a marked degree during the past minutes, and continued to increase steadily to the climax. He recognised that the drain on his own vitality grew steadily, and that the attack was now directed against himself even more than against the defeated dog, and the too much deceived cat.</p><p>It all seemed so rapid and uncalculated after that--the events that took place in this little modern room at the top of Putney Hill between midnight and sunrise--that Dr. Silence was hardly able to follow and remember it all. It came about with such uncanny swiftness and terror; the light was so uncertain; the movements of the black cat so difficult to follow on the dark carpet, and the doctor himself so weary and taken by surprise--that he found it almost impossible to observe accurately, or to recall afterwards precisely what it was he had seen or in what order the incidents had taken place. He never could understand what defect of vision on his part made it seem as though the cat had duplicated itself at first, and then increased indefinitely, so that there were at least a dozen of them darting silently about the floor, leaping softly on to chairs and tables, passing like shadows from the open door to the end of the room, all black as sin, with brilliant green eyes flashing fire in all directions. It was like the reflections from a score of mirrors placed round the walls at different angles. Nor could he make out at the time why the size of the room seemed to have altered, grown much larger, and why it extended away behind him where ordinarily the wall should have been. The snarling of the enraged and terrified collie sounded sometimes so far away; the ceiling seemed to have raised itself so much higher than before, and much of the furniture had changed in appearance and shifted marvellously.</p><p>It was all so confused and confusing, as though the little room he knew had become merged and transformed into the dimensions of quite another chamber, that came to him, with its host of cats and its strange distances, in a sort of vision.</p><p>But these changes came about a little later, and at a time when his attention was so concentrated upon the proceedings of Smoke and the collie, that he only observed them, as it were, subconsciously. And the excitement, the flickering candlelight, the distress he felt for the collie, and the distorting atmosphere of fog were the poorest possible allies to careful observation.</p><p>At first he was only aware that the dog was repeating his short dangerous bark from time to time, snapping viciously at the empty air, a foot or so from the ground. Once, indeed, he sprang upwards and forwards, working furiously with teeth and paws, and with a noise like wolves fighting, but only to dash back the next minute against the wall behind him. Then, after lying still for a bit, he rose to a crouching position as though to spring again, snarling horribly and making short half-circles with lowered head. And Smoke all the while meowed piteously by the window as though trying to draw the attack upon himself.</p><p>Then it was that the rush of the whole dreadful business seemed to turn aside from the dog and direct itself upon his own person. The collie had made another spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner, where he made noise enough in his savage rage to waken the dead before he fell to whining and then finally lay still. And directly afterwards the doctor&#39;s own distress became intolerably acute. He had made a half movement forward to come to the rescue when a veil that was denser than mere fog seemed to drop down over the scene, draping room, walls, animals and fire in a mist of darkness and folding also about his own mind. Other forms moved silently across the field of vision, forms that he recognised from previous experiments, and welcomed not. Unholy thoughts began to crowd into his brain, sinister suggestions of evil presented themselves seductively. Ice seemed to settle about his heart, and his mind trembled. He began to lose memory--memory of his identity, of where he was, of what he ought to do. The very foundations of his strength were shaken. His will seemed paralysed.</p><p>And it was then that the room filled with this horde of cats, all dark as the night, all silent, all with lamping eyes of green fire. The dimensions of the place altered and shifted. He was in a much larger space. The whining of the dog sounded far away, and all about him the cats flew busily to and fro, silently playing their tearing, rushing game of evil, weaving the pattern of their dark purpose upon the floor. He strove hard to collect himself and remember the words of power he had made use of before in similar dread positions where his dangerous practice had sometimes led; but he could recall nothing consecutively; a mist lay over his mind and memory; he felt dazed and his forces scattered. The deeps within were too troubled for healing power to come out of them.</p><p>It was glamour, of course, he realised afterwards, the strong glamour thrown upon his imagination by some powerful personality behind the veil; but at the time he was not sufficiently aware of this and, as with all true glamour, was unable to grasp where the true ended and the false began. He was caught momentarily in the same vortex that had sought to lure the cat to destruction through its delight, and threatened utterly to overwhelm the dog through its terror.</p><p>There came a sound in the chimney behind him like wind booming and tearing its way down. The windows rattled. The candle flickered and went out. The glacial atmosphere closed round him with the cold of death, and a great rushing sound swept by overhead as though the ceiling had lifted to a great height. He heard the door shut. Far away it sounded. He felt lost, shelterless in the depths of his soul. Yet still he held out and resisted while the climax of the fight came nearer and nearer.... He had stepped into the stream of forces awakened by Pender and he knew that he must withstand them to the end or come to a conclusion that it was not good for a man to come to. Something from the region of utter cold was upon him.</p><p>And then quite suddenly, through the confused mists about him, there slowly rose up the Personality that had been all the time directing the battle. Some force entered his being that shook him as the tempest shakes a leaf, and close against his eyes--clean level with his face--he found himself staring into the wreck of a vast dark Countenance, a countenance that was terrible even in its ruin.</p><p>For ruined it was, and terrible it was, and the mark of spiritual evil was branded everywhere upon its broken features. Eyes, face and hair rose level with his own, and for a space of time he never could properly measure, or determine, these two, a man and a woman, looked straight into each other&#39;s visages and down into each other&#39;s hearts.</p><p>And John Silence, the soul with the good, unselfish motive, held his own against the dark discarnate woman whose motive was pure evil, and whose soul was on the side of the Dark Powers.</p><p>It was the climax that touched the depth of power within him and began to restore him slowly to his own. He was conscious, of course, of effort, and yet it seemed no superhuman one, for he had recognised the character of his opponent&#39;s power, and he called upon the good within him to meet and overcome it. The inner forces stirred and trembled in response to his call. They did not at first come readily as was their habit, for under the spell of glamour they had already been diabolically lulled into inactivity, but come they eventually did, rising out of the inner spiritual nature he had learned with so much time and pain to awaken to life. And power and confidence came with them. He began to breathe deeply and regularly, and at the same time to absorb into himself the forces opposed to him, and to <em>turn them to his own account</em>. By ceasing to resist, and allowing the deadly stream to pour into him unopposed, he used the very power supplied by his adversary and thus enormously increased his own.</p><p>For this spiritual alchemy he had learned. He understood that force ultimately is everywhere one and the same; it is the motive behind that makes it good or evil; and his motive was entirely unselfish. He knew--provided he was not first robbed of self-control--how vicariously to absorb these evil radiations into himself and change them magically into his own good purposes. And, since his motive was pure and his soul fearless, they could not work him harm.</p><p>Thus he stood in the main stream of evil unwittingly attracted by Pender, deflecting its course upon himself; and after passing through the purifying filter of his own unselfishness these energies could only add to his store of experience, of knowledge, and therefore of power. And, as his self-control returned to him, he gradually accomplished this purpose, even though trembling while he did so.</p><p>Yet the struggle was severe, and in spite of the freezing chill of the air, the perspiration poured down his face. Then, by slow degrees, the dark and dreadful countenance faded, the glamour passed from his soul, the normal proportions returned to walls and ceiling, the forms melted back into the fog, and the whirl of rushing shadow-cats disappeared whence they came.</p><p>And with the return of the consciousness of his own identity John Silence was restored to the full control of his own will-power. In a deep, modulated voice he began to utter certain rhythmical sounds that slowly rolled through the air like a rising sea, filling the room with powerful vibratory activities that whelmed all irregularities of lesser vibrations in its own swelling tone. He made certain sigils, gestures and movements at the same time. For several minutes he continued to utter these words, until at length the growing volume dominated the whole room and mastered the manifestation of all that opposed it. For just as he understood the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil forces by raising them into higher channels, so he knew from long study the occult use of sound, and its direct effect upon the plastic region wherein the powers of spiritual evil work their fell purposes. Harmony was restored first of all to his own soul, and thence to the room and all its occupants.</p><p>And, after himself, the first to recognise it was the old dog lying in his corner. Flame began suddenly uttering sounds of pleasure, that &quot;something&quot; between a growl and a grunt that dogs make upon being restored to their master&#39;s confidence. Dr. Silence heard the thumping of the collie&#39;s tail against the floor. And the grunt and the thumping touched the depth of affection in the man&#39;s heart, and gave him some inkling of what agonies the dumb creature had suffered.</p><p>Next, from the shadows by the window, a somewhat shrill purring announced the restoration of the cat to its normal state. Smoke was advancing across the carpet. He seemed very pleased with himself, and smiled with an expression of supreme innocence. He was no shadow-cat, but real and full of his usual and perfect self-possession. He marched along, picking his way delicately, but with a stately dignity that suggested his ancestry with the majesty of Egypt. His eyes no longer glared; they shone steadily before him, they radiated, not excitement, but knowledge. Clearly he was anxious to make amends for the mischief to which he had unwittingly lent himself owing to his subtle and electric constitution.</p><p>Still uttering his sharp high purrings he marched up to his master and rubbed vigorously against his legs. Then he stood on his hind feet and pawed his knees and stared beseechingly up into his face. He turned his head towards the corner where the collie still lay, thumping his tail feebly and pathetically.</p><p>John Silence understood. He bent down and stroked the creature&#39;s living fur, noting the line of bright blue sparks that followed the motion of his hand down its back. And then they advanced together towards the corner where the dog was.</p><p>Smoke went first and put his nose gently against his friend&#39;s muzzle, purring while he rubbed, and uttering little soft sounds of affection in his throat. The doctor lit the candle and brought it over. He saw the collie lying on its side against the wall; it was utterly exhausted, and foam still hung about its jaws. Its tail and eyes responded to the sound of its name, but it was evidently very weak and overcome. Smoke continued to rub against its cheek and nose and eyes, sometimes even standing on its body and kneading into the thick yellow hair. Flame replied from time to time by little licks of the tongue, most of them curiously misdirected.</p><p>But Dr. Silence felt intuitively that something disastrous had happened, and his heart was wrung. He stroked the dear body, feeling it over for bruises or broken bones, but finding none. He fed it with what remained of the sandwiches and milk, but the creature clumsily upset the saucer and lost the sandwiches between its paws, so that the doctor had to feed it with his own hand. And all the while Smoke meowed piteously.</p><p>Then John Silence began to understand. He went across to the farther side of the room and called aloud to it.</p><p>&quot;Flame, old man! come!&quot;</p><p>At any other time the dog would have been upon him in an instant, barking and leaping to the shoulder. And even now he got up, though heavily and awkwardly, to his feet. He started to run, wagging his tail more briskly. He collided first with a chair, and then ran straight into a table. Smoke trotted close at his side, trying his very best to guide him. But it was useless. Dr. Silence had to lift him up into his own arms and carry him like a baby. For he was blind.</p><p>III</p><p>It was a week later when John Silence called to see the author in his new house, and found him well on the way to recovery and already busy again with his writing. The haunted look had left his eyes, and he seemed cheerful and confident.</p><p>&quot;Humour restored?&quot; laughed the doctor, as soon as they were comfortably settled in the room overlooking the Park.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve had no trouble since I left that dreadful place,&quot; returned Pender gratefully; &quot;and thanks to you--&quot;</p><p>The doctor stopped him with a gesture.</p><p>&quot;Never mind that,&quot; he said, &quot;we&#39;ll discuss your new plans afterwards, and my scheme for relieving you of the house and helping you settle elsewhere. Of course it must be pulled down, for it&#39;s not fit for any sensitive person to live in, and any other tenant might be afflicted in the same way you were. Although, personally, I think the evil has exhausted itself by now.&quot;</p><p>He told the astonished author something of his experiences in it with the animals.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t pretend to understand,&quot; Pender said, when the account was finished, &quot;but I and my wife are intensely relieved to be free of it all. Only I must say I should like to know something of the former history of the house. When we took it six months ago I heard no word against it.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence drew a typewritten paper from his pocket.</p><p>&quot;I can satisfy your curiosity to some extent,&quot; he said, running his eye over the sheets, and then replacing them in his coat; &quot;for by my secretary&#39;s investigations I have been able to check certain information obtained in the hypnotic trance by a &#39;sensitive&#39; who helps me in such cases. The former occupant who haunted you appears to have been a woman of singularly atrocious life and character who finally suffered death by hanging, after a series of crimes that appalled the whole of England and only came to light by the merest chance. She came to her end in the year 1798, for it was not this particular house she lived in, but a much larger one that then stood upon the site it now occupies, and was then, of course, not in London, but in the country. She was a person of intellect, possessed of a powerful, trained will, and of consummate audacity, and I am convinced availed herself of the resources of the lower magic to attain her ends. This goes far to explain the virulence of the attack upon yourself, and why she is still able to carry on after death the evil practices that formed her main purpose during life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think that after death a soul can still consciously direct--&quot; gasped the author.</p><p>&quot;I think, as I told you before, that the forces of a powerful personality may still persist after death in the line of their original momentum,&quot; replied the doctor; &quot;and that strong thoughts and purposes can still react upon suitably prepared brains long after their originators have passed away.</p><p>&quot;If you knew anything of magic,&quot; he pursued, &quot;you would know that thought is dynamic, and that it may call into existence forms and pictures that may well exist for hundreds of years. For, not far removed from the region of our human life is another region where float the waste and drift of all the centuries, the limbo of the shells of the dead; a densely populated region crammed with horror and abomination of all descriptions, and sometimes galvanised into active life again by the will of a trained manipulator, a mind versed in the practices of lower magic. That this woman understood its vile commerce, I am persuaded, and the forces she set going during her life have simply been accumulating ever since, and would have continued to do so had they not been drawn down upon yourself, and afterwards discharged and satisfied through me.</p><p>&quot;Anything might have brought down the attack, for, besides drugs, there are certain violent emotions, certain moods of the soul, certain spiritual fevers, if I may so call them, which directly open the inner being to a cognisance of this astral region I have mentioned. In your case it happened to be a peculiarly potent drug that did it.</p><p>&quot;But now, tell me,&quot; he added, after a pause, handing to the perplexed author a pencil drawing he had made of the dark countenance that had appeared to him during the night on Putney Hill--&quot;tell me if you recognise this face?&quot;</p><p>Pender looked at the drawing closely, greatly astonished. He shuddered a little as he looked.</p><p>&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; he said, &quot;it is the face I kept trying to draw--dark, with the great mouth and jaw, and the drooping eye. That is the woman.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence then produced from his pocket-book an old-fashioned woodcut of the same person which his secretary had unearthed from the records of the Newgate Calendar. The woodcut and the pencil drawing were two different aspects of the same dreadful visage. The men compared them for some moments in silence.</p><p>&quot;It makes me thank God for the limitations of our senses,&quot; said Pender quietly, with a sigh; &quot;continuous clairvoyance must be a sore affliction.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is indeed,&quot; returned John Silence significantly, &quot;and if all the people nowadays who claim to be clairvoyant were really so, the statistics of suicide and lunacy would be considerably higher than they are. It is little wonder,&quot; he added, &quot;that your sense of humour was clouded, with the mind-forces of that dead monster trying to use your brain for their dissemination. You have had an interesting adventure, Mr. Felix Pender, and, let me add, a fortunate escape.&quot;</p><p>The author was about to renew his thanks when there came a sound of scratching at the door, and the doctor sprang up quickly.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s time for me to go. I left my dog on the step, but I suppose--&quot;</p><p>Before he had time to open the door, it had yielded to the pressure behind it and flew wide open to admit a great yellow-haired collie. The dog, wagging his tail and contorting his whole body with delight, tore across the floor and tried to leap up upon his owner&#39;s breast. And there was laughter and happiness in the old eyes; for they were clear again as the day.</p><p>CASE II: ANCIENT SORCERIES</p><p>I</p><p>There are, it would appear, certain wholly unremarkable persons, with none of the characteristics that invite adventure, who yet once or twice in the course of their smooth lives undergo an experience so strange that the world catches its breath--and looks the other way! And it was cases of this kind, perhaps, more than any other, that fell into the wide-spread net of John Silence, the psychic doctor, and, appealing to his deep humanity, to his patience, and to his great qualities of spiritual sympathy, led often to the revelation of problems of the strangest complexity, and of the profoundest possible human interest.</p><p>Matters that seemed almost too curious and fantastic for belief he loved to trace to their hidden sources. To unravel a tangle in the very soul of things--and to release a suffering human soul in the process--was with him a veritable passion. And the knots he untied were, indeed, after passing strange.</p><p>The world, of course, asks for some plausible basis to which it can attach credence--something it can, at least, pretend to explain. The adventurous type it can understand: such people carry about with them an adequate explanation of their exciting lives, and their characters obviously drive them into the circumstances which produce the adventures. It expects nothing else from them, and is satisfied. But dull, ordinary folk have no right to out-of-the-way experiences, and the world having been led to expect otherwise, is disappointed with them, not to say shocked. Its complacent judgment has been rudely disturbed.</p><p>&quot;Such a thing happened to <em>that</em> man!&quot; it cries--&quot;a commonplace person like that! It is too absurd! There must be something wrong!&quot;</p><p>Yet there could be no question that something did actually happen to little Arthur Vezin, something of the curious nature he described to Dr. Silence. Outwardly or inwardly, it happened beyond a doubt, and in spite of the jeers of his few friends who heard the tale, and observed wisely that &quot;such a thing might perhaps have come to Iszard, that crack-brained Iszard, or to that odd fish Minski, but it could never have happened to commonplace little Vezin, who was fore-ordained to live and die according to scale.&quot;</p><p>But, whatever his method of death was, Vezin certainly did not &quot;live according to scale&quot; so far as this particular event in his otherwise uneventful life was concerned; and to hear him recount it, and watch his pale delicate features change, and hear his voice grow softer and more hushed as he proceeded, was to know the conviction that his halting words perhaps failed sometimes to convey. He lived the thing over again each time he told it. His whole personality became muffled in the recital. It subdued him more than ever, so that the tale became a lengthy apology for an experience that he deprecated. He appeared to excuse himself and ask your pardon for having dared to take part in so fantastic an episode. For little Vezin was a timid, gentle, sensitive soul, rarely able to assert himself, tender to man and beast, and almost constitutionally unable to say No, or to claim many things that should rightly have been his. His whole scheme of life seemed utterly remote from anything more exciting than missing a train or losing an umbrella on an omnibus. And when this curious event came upon him he was already more years beyond forty than his friends suspected or he cared to admit.</p><p>John Silence, who heard him speak of his experience more than once, said that he sometimes left out certain details and put in others; yet they were all obviously true. The whole scene was unforgettably cinematographed on to his mind. None of the details were imagined or invented. And when he told the story with them all complete, the effect was undeniable. His appealing brown eyes shone, and much of the charming personality, usually so carefully repressed, came forward and revealed itself. His modesty was always there, of course, but in the telling he forgot the present and allowed himself to appear almost vividly as he lived again in the past of his adventure.</p><p>He was on the way home when it happened, crossing northern France from some mountain trip or other where he buried himself solitary-wise every summer. He had nothing but an unregistered bag in the rack, and the train was jammed to suffocation, most of the passengers being unredeemed holiday English. He disliked them, not because they were his fellow-countrymen, but because they were noisy and obtrusive, obliterating with their big limbs and tweed clothing all the quieter tints of the day that brought him satisfaction and enabled him to melt into insignificance and forget that he was anybody. These English clashed about him like a brass band, making him feel vaguely that he ought to be more self-assertive and obstreperous, and that he did not claim insistently enough all kinds of things that he didn&#39;t want and that were really valueless, such as corner seats, windows up or down, and so forth.</p><p>So that he felt uncomfortable in the train, and wished the journey were over and he was back again living with his unmarried sister in Surbiton.</p><p>And when the train stopped for ten panting minutes at the little station in northern France, and he got out to stretch his legs on the platform, and saw to his dismay a further batch of the British Isles debouching from another train, it suddenly seemed impossible to him to continue the journey. Even <em>his</em> flabby soul revolted, and the idea of staying a night in the little town and going on next day by a slower, emptier train, flashed into his mind. The guard was already shouting &quot;<em>en voiture</em>&quot; and the corridor of his compartment was already packed when the thought came to him. And, for once, he acted with decision and rushed to snatch his bag.</p><p>Finding the corridor and steps impassable, he tapped at the window (for he had a corner seat) and begged the Frenchman who sat opposite to hand his luggage out to him, explaining in his wretched French that he intended to break the journey there. And this elderly Frenchman, he declared, gave him a look, half of warning, half of reproach, that to his dying day he could never forget; handed the bag through the window of the moving train; and at the same time poured into his ears a long sentence, spoken rapidly and low, of which he was able to comprehend only the last few words: &quot;<em>a cause du sommeil et a cause des chats</em>.&quot;</p><p>In reply to Dr. Silence, whose singular psychic acuteness at once seized upon this Frenchman as a vital point in the adventure, Vezin admitted that the man had impressed him favourably from the beginning, though without being able to explain why. They had sat facing one another during the four hours of the journey, and though no conversation had passed between them--Vezin was timid about his stuttering French--he confessed that his eyes were being continually drawn to his face, almost, he felt, to rudeness, and that each, by a dozen nameless little politenesses and attentions, had evinced the desire to be kind. The men liked each other and their personalities did not clash, or would not have clashed had they chanced to come to terms of acquaintance. The Frenchman, indeed, seemed to have exercised a silent protective influence over the insignificant little Englishman, and without words or gestures betrayed that he wished him well and would gladly have been of service to him.</p><p>&quot;And this sentence that he hurled at you after the bag?&quot; asked John Silence, smiling that peculiarly sympathetic smile that always melted the prejudices of his patient, &quot;were you unable to follow it exactly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was so quick and low and vehement,&quot; explained Vezin, in his small voice, &quot;that I missed practically the whole of it. I only caught the few words at the very end, because he spoke them so clearly, and his face was bent down out of the carriage window so near to mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&#39;<em>A cause du sommeil et a cause des chats&#39;?</em>&quot; repeated Dr. Silence, as though half speaking to himself.</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s it exactly,&quot; said Vezin; &quot;which, I take it, means something like &#39;because of sleep and because of the cats,&#39; doesn&#39;t it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly, that&#39;s how I should translate it,&quot; the doctor observed shortly, evidently not wishing to interrupt more than necessary.</p><p>&quot;And the rest of the sentence--all the first part I couldn&#39;t understand, I mean--was a warning not to do something--not to stop in the town, or at some particular place in the town, perhaps. That was the impression it made on me.&quot;</p><p>Then, of course, the train rushed off, and left Vezin standing on the platform alone and rather forlorn.</p><p>The little town climbed in straggling fashion up a sharp hill rising out of the plain at the back of the station, and was crowned by the twin towers of the ruined cathedral peeping over the summit. From the station itself it looked uninteresting and modern, but the fact was that the mediaeval position lay out of sight just beyond the crest. And once he reached the top and entered the old streets, he stepped clean out of modern life into a bygone century. The noise and bustle of the crowded train seemed days away. The spirit of this silent hill-town, remote from tourists and motor-cars, dreaming its own quiet life under the autumn sun, rose up and cast its spell upon him. Long before he recognised this spell he acted under it. He walked softly, almost on tiptoe, down the winding narrow streets where the gables all but met over his head, and he entered the doorway of the solitary inn with a deprecating and modest demeanour that was in itself an apology for intruding upon the place and disturbing its dream.</p><p>At first, however, Vezin said, he noticed very little of all this. The attempt at analysis came much later. What struck him then was only the delightful contrast of the silence and peace after the dust and noisy rattle of the train. He felt soothed and stroked like a cat.</p><p>&quot;Like a cat, you said?&quot; interrupted John Silence, quickly catching him up.</p><p>&quot;Yes. At the very start I felt that.&quot; He laughed apologetically. &quot;I felt as though the warmth and the stillness and the comfort made me purr. It seemed to be the general mood of the whole place--then.&quot;</p><p>The inn, a rambling ancient house, the atmosphere of the old coaching days still about it, apparently did not welcome him too warmly. He felt he was only tolerated, he said. But it was cheap and comfortable, and the delicious cup of afternoon tea he ordered at once made him feel really very pleased with himself for leaving the train in this bold, original way. For to him it had seemed bold and original. He felt something of a dog. His room, too, soothed him with its dark panelling and low irregular ceiling, and the long sloping passage that led to it seemed the natural pathway to a real Chamber of Sleep--a little dim cubby hole out of the world where noise could not enter. It looked upon the courtyard at the back. It was all very charming, and made him think of himself as dressed in very soft velvet somehow, and the floors seemed padded, the walls provided with cushions. The sounds of the streets could not penetrate there. It was an atmosphere of absolute rest that surrounded him.</p><p>On engaging the two-franc room he had interviewed the only person who seemed to be about that sleepy afternoon, an elderly waiter with Dundreary whiskers and a drowsy courtesy, who had ambled lazily towards him across the stone yard; but on coming downstairs again for a little promenade in the town before dinner he encountered the proprietress herself. She was a large woman whose hands, feet, and features seemed to swim towards him out of a sea of person. They emerged, so to speak. But she had great dark, vivacious eyes that counteracted the bulk of her body, and betrayed the fact that in reality she was both vigorous and alert. When he first caught sight of her she was knitting in a low chair against the sunlight of the wall, and something at once made him see her as a great tabby cat, dozing, yet awake, heavily sleepy, and yet at the same time prepared for instantaneous action. A great mouser on the watch occurred to him.</p><p>She took him in with a single comprehensive glance that was polite without being cordial. Her neck, he noticed, was extraordinarily supple in spite of its proportions, for it turned so easily to follow him, and the head it carried bowed so very flexibly.</p><p>&quot;But when she looked at me, you know,&quot; said Vezin, with that little apologetic smile in his brown eyes, and that faintly deprecating gesture of the shoulders that was characteristic of him, &quot;the odd notion came to me that really she had intended to make quite a different movement, and that with a single bound she could have leaped at me across the width of that stone yard and pounced upon me like some huge cat upon a mouse.&quot;</p><p>He laughed a little soft laugh, and Dr. Silence made a note in his book without interrupting, while Vezin proceeded in a tone as though he feared he had already told too much and more than we could believe.</p><p>&quot;Very soft, yet very active she was, for all her size and mass, and I felt she knew what I was doing even after I had passed and was behind her back. She spoke to me, and her voice was smooth and running. She asked if I had my luggage, and was comfortable in my room, and then added that dinner was at seven o&#39;clock, and that they were very early people in this little country town. Clearly, she intended to convey that late hours were not encouraged.&quot;</p><p>Evidently, she contrived by voice and manner to give him the impression that here he would be &quot;managed,&quot; that everything would be arranged and planned for him, and that he had nothing to do but fall into the groove and obey. No decided action or sharp personal effort would be looked for from him. It was the very reverse of the train. He walked quietly out into the street feeling soothed and peaceful. He realised that he was in a <em>milieu</em> that suited him and stroked him the right way. It was so much easier to be obedient. He began to purr again, and to feel that all the town purred with him.</p><p>About the streets of that little town he meandered gently, falling deeper and deeper into the spirit of repose that characterised it. With no special aim he wandered up and down, and to and fro. The September sunshine fell slantingly over the roofs. Down winding alleyways, fringed with tumbling gables and open casements, he caught fairylike glimpses of the great plain below, and of the meadows and yellow copses lying like a dream-map in the haze. The spell of the past held very potently here, he felt.</p><p>The streets were full of picturesquely garbed men and women, all busy enough, going their respective ways; but no one took any notice of him or turned to stare at his obviously English appearance. He was even able to forget that with his tourist appearance he was a false note in a charming picture, and he melted more and more into the scene, feeling delightfully insignificant and unimportant and unselfconscious. It was like becoming part of a softly coloured dream which he did not even realise to be a dream.</p><p>On the eastern side the hill fell away more sharply, and the plain below ran off rather suddenly into a sea of gathering shadows in which the little patches of woodland looked like islands and the stubble fields like deep water. Here he strolled along the old ramparts of ancient fortifications that once had been formidable, but now were only vision-like with their charming mingling of broken grey walls and wayward vine and ivy. From the broad coping on which he sat for a moment, level with the rounded tops of clipped plane trees, he saw the esplanade far below lying in shadow. Here and there a yellow sunbeam crept in and lay upon the fallen yellow leaves, and from the height he looked down and saw that the townsfolk were walking to and fro in the cool of the evening. He could just hear the sound of their slow footfalls, and the murmur of their voices floated up to him through the gaps between the trees. The figures looked like shadows as he caught glimpses of their quiet movements far below.</p><p>He sat there for some time pondering, bathed in the waves of murmurs and half-lost echoes that rose to his ears, muffled by the leaves of the plane trees. The whole town, and the little hill out of which it grew as naturally as an ancient wood, seemed to him like a being lying there half asleep on the plain and crooning to itself as it dozed.</p><p>And, presently, as he sat lazily melting into its dream, a sound of horns and strings and wood instruments rose to his ears, and the town band began to play at the far end of the crowded terrace below to the accompaniment of a very soft, deep-throated drum. Vezin was very sensitive to music, knew about it intelligently, and had even ventured, unknown to his friends, upon the composition of quiet melodies with low-running chords which he played to himself with the soft pedal when no one was about. And this music floating up through the trees from an invisible and doubtless very picturesque band of the townspeople wholly charmed him. He recognised nothing that they played, and it sounded as though they were simply improvising without a conductor. No definitely marked time ran through the pieces, which ended and began oddly after the fashion of wind through an Aeolian harp. It was part of the place and scene, just as the dying sunlight and faintly breathing wind were part of the scene and hour, and the mellow notes of old-fashioned plaintive horns, pierced here and there by the sharper strings, all half smothered by the continuous booming of the deep drum, touched his soul with a curiously potent spell that was almost too engrossing to be quite pleasant.</p><p>There was a certain queer sense of bewitchment in it all. The music seemed to him oddly unartificial. It made him think of trees swept by the wind, of night breezes singing among wires and chimney-stacks, or in the rigging of invisible ships; or--and the simile leaped up in his thoughts with a sudden sharpness of suggestion--a chorus of animals, of wild creatures, somewhere in desolate places of the world, crying and singing as animals will, to the moon. He could fancy he heard the wailing, half-human cries of cats upon the tiles at night, rising and falling with weird intervals of sound, and this music, muffled by distance and the trees, made him think of a queer company of these creatures on some roof far away in the sky, uttering their solemn music to one another and the moon in chorus.</p><p>It was, he felt at the time, a singular image to occur to him, yet it expressed his sensation pictorially better than anything else. The instruments played such impossibly odd intervals, and the crescendos and diminuendos were so very suggestive of cat-land on the tiles at night, rising swiftly, dropping without warning to deep notes again, and all in such strange confusion of discords and accords. But, at the same time a plaintive sweetness resulted on the whole, and the discords of these half-broken instruments were so singular that they did not distress his musical soul like fiddles out of tune.</p><p>He listened a long time, wholly surrendering himself as his character was, and then strolled homewards in the dusk as the air grew chilly.</p><p>&quot;There was nothing to alarm?&quot; put in Dr. Silence briefly.</p><p>&quot;Absolutely nothing,&quot; said Vezin; &quot;but you know it was all so fantastical and charming that my imagination was profoundly impressed. Perhaps, too,&quot; he continued, gently explanatory, &quot;it was this stirring of my imagination that caused other impressions; for, as I walked back, the spell of the place began to steal over me in a dozen ways, though all intelligible ways. But there were other things I could not account for in the least, even then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Incidents, you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hardly incidents, I think. A lot of vivid sensations crowded themselves upon my mind and I could trace them to no causes. It was just after sunset and the tumbled old buildings traced magical outlines against an opalescent sky of gold and red. The dusk was running down the twisted streets. All round the hill the plain pressed in like a dim sea, its level rising with the darkness. The spell of this kind of scene, you know, can be very moving, and it was so that night. Yet I felt that what came to me had nothing directly to do with the mystery and wonder of the scene.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not merely the subtle transformations of the spirit that come with beauty,&quot; put in the doctor, noticing his hesitation.</p><p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; Vezin went on, duly encouraged and no longer so fearful of our smiles at his expense. &quot;The impressions came from somewhere else. For instance, down the busy main street where men and women were bustling home from work, shopping at stalls and barrows, idly gossiping in groups, and all the rest of it, I saw that I aroused no interest and that no one turned to stare at me as a foreigner and stranger. I was utterly ignored, and my presence among them excited no special interest or attention.</p><p>&quot;And then, quite suddenly, it dawned upon me with conviction that all the time this indifference and inattention were merely feigned. Everybody as a matter of fact was watching me closely. Every movement I made was known and observed. Ignoring me was all a pretence--an elaborate pretence.&quot;</p><p>He paused a moment and looked at us to see if we were smiling, and then continued, reassured--</p><p>&quot;It is useless to ask me how I noticed this, because I simply cannot explain it. But the discovery gave me something of a shock. Before I got back to the inn, however, another curious thing rose up strongly in my mind and forced my recognition of it as true. And this, too, I may as well say at once, was equally inexplicable to me. I mean I can only give you the fact, as fact it was to me.&quot;</p><p>The little man left his chair and stood on the mat before the fire. His diffidence lessened from now onwards, as he lost himself again in the magic of the old adventure. His eyes shone a little already as he talked.</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; he went on, his soft voice rising somewhat with his excitement, &quot;I was in a shop when it came to me first--though the idea must have been at work for a long time subconsciously to appear in so complete a form all at once. I was buying socks, I think,&quot; he laughed, &quot;and struggling with my dreadful French, when it struck me that the woman in the shop did not care two pins whether I bought anything or not. She was indifferent whether she made a sale or did not make a sale. She was only pretending to sell.</p><p>&quot;This sounds a very small and fanciful incident to build upon what follows. But really it was not small. I mean it was the spark that lit the line of powder and ran along to the big blaze in my mind.</p><p>&quot;For the whole town, I suddenly realised, was something other than I so far saw it. The real activities and interests of the people were elsewhere and otherwise than appeared. Their true lives lay somewhere out of sight behind the scenes. Their busy-ness was but the outward semblance that masked their actual purposes. They bought and sold, and ate and drank, and walked about the streets, yet all the while the main stream of their existence lay somewhere beyond my ken, underground, in secret places. In the shops and at the stalls they did not care whether I purchased their articles or not; at the inn, they were indifferent to my staying or going; their life lay remote from my own, springing from hidden, mysterious sources, coursing out of sight, unknown. It was all a great elaborate pretence, assumed possibly for my benefit, or possibly for purposes of their own. But the main current of their energies ran elsewhere. I almost felt as an unwelcome foreign substance might be expected to feel when it has found its way into the human system and the whole body organises itself to eject it or to absorb it. The town was doing this very thing to me.</p><p>&quot;This bizarre notion presented itself forcibly to my mind as I walked home to the inn, and I began busily to wonder wherein the true life of this town could lie and what were the actual interests and activities of its hidden life.</p><p>&quot;And, now that my eyes were partly opened, I noticed other things too that puzzled me, first of which, I think, was the extraordinary silence of the whole place. Positively, the town was muffled. Although the streets were paved with cobbles the people moved about silently, softly, with padded feet, like cats. Nothing made noise. All was hushed, subdued, muted. The very voices were quiet, low-pitched like purring. Nothing clamorous, vehement or emphatic seemed able to live in the drowsy atmosphere of soft dreaming that soothed this little hill-town into its sleep. It was like the woman at the inn--an outward repose screening intense inner activity and purpose.</p><p>&quot;Yet there was no sign of lethargy or sluggishness anywhere about it. The people were active and alert. Only a magical and uncanny softness lay over them all like a spell.&quot;</p><p>Vezin passed his hand across his eyes for a moment as though the memory had become very vivid. His voice had run off into a whisper so that we heard the last part with difficulty. He was telling a true thing obviously, yet something that he both liked and hated telling.</p><p>&quot;I went back to the inn,&quot; he continued presently in a louder voice, &quot;and dined. I felt a new strange world about me. My old world of reality receded. Here, whether I liked it or no, was something new and incomprehensible. I regretted having left the train so impulsively. An adventure was upon me, and I loathed adventures as foreign to my nature. Moreover, this was the beginning apparently of an adventure somewhere deep within me, in a region I could not check or measure, and a feeling of alarm mingled itself with my wonder--alarm for the stability of what I had for forty years recognised as my &#39;personality.&#39;</p><p>&quot;I went upstairs to bed, my mind teeming with thoughts that were unusual to me, and of rather a haunting description. By way of relief I kept thinking of that nice, prosaic noisy train and all those wholesome, blustering passengers. I almost wished I were with them again. But my dreams took me elsewhere. I dreamed of cats, and soft-moving creatures, and the silence of life in a dim muffled world beyond the senses.&quot;</p><p>II</p><p>Vezin stayed on from day to day, indefinitely, much longer than he had intended. He felt in a kind of dazed, somnolent condition. He did nothing in particular, but the place fascinated him and he could not decide to leave. Decisions were always very difficult for him and he sometimes wondered how he had ever brought himself to the point of leaving the train. It seemed as though some one else must have arranged it for him, and once or twice his thoughts ran to the swarthy Frenchman who had sat opposite. If only he could have understood that long sentence ending so strangely with &quot;<em>a cause du sommeil et a cause des chats</em>.&quot; He wondered what it all meant.</p><p>Meanwhile the hushed softness of the town held him prisoner and he sought in his muddling, gentle way to find out where the mystery lay, and what it was all about. But his limited French and his constitutional hatred of active investigation made it hard for him to buttonhole anybody and ask questions. He was content to observe, and watch, and remain negative.</p><p>The weather held on calm and hazy, and this just suited him. He wandered about the town till he knew every street and alley. The people suffered him to come and go without let or hindrance, though it became clearer to him every day that he was never free himself from observation. The town watched him as a cat watches a mouse. And he got no nearer to finding out what they were all so busy with or where the main stream of their activities lay. This remained hidden. The people were as soft and mysterious as cats.</p><p>But that he was continually under observation became more evident from day to day.</p><p>For instance, when he strolled to the end of the town and entered a little green public garden beneath the ramparts and seated himself upon one of the empty benches in the sun, he was quite alone--at first. Not another seat was occupied; the little park was empty, the paths deserted. Yet, within ten minutes of his coming, there must have been fully twenty persons scattered about him, some strolling aimlessly along the gravel walks, staring at the flowers, and others seated on the wooden benches enjoying the sun like himself. None of them appeared to take any notice of him; yet he understood quite well they had all come there to watch. They kept him under close observation. In the street they had seemed busy enough, hurrying upon various errands; yet these were suddenly all forgotten and they had nothing to do but loll and laze in the sun, their duties unremembered. Five minutes after he left, the garden was again deserted, the seats vacant. But in the crowded street it was the same thing again; he was never alone. He was ever in their thoughts.</p><p>By degrees, too, he began to see how it was he was so cleverly watched, yet without the appearance of it. The people did nothing <em>directly</em>. They behaved <em>obliquely</em>. He laughed in his mind as the thought thus clothed itself in words, but the phrase exactly described it. They looked at him from angles which naturally should have led their sight in another direction altogether. Their movements were oblique, too, so far as these concerned himself. The straight, direct thing was not their way evidently. They did nothing obviously. If he entered a shop to buy, the woman walked instantly away and busied herself with something at the farther end of the counter, though answering at once when he spoke, showing that she knew he was there and that this was only her way of attending to him. It was the fashion of the cat she followed. Even in the dining-room of the inn, the be-whiskered and courteous waiter, lithe and silent in all his movements, never seemed able to come straight to his table for an order or a dish. He came by zigzags, indirectly, vaguely, so that he appeared to be going to another table altogether, and only turned suddenly at the last moment, and was there beside him.</p><p>Vezin smiled curiously to himself as he described how he began to realize these things. Other tourists there were none in the hostel, but he recalled the figures of one or two old men, inhabitants, who took their <em>dejeuner</em> and dinner there, and remembered how fantastically they entered the room in similar fashion. First, they paused in the doorway, peering about the room, and then, after a temporary inspection, they came in, as it were, sideways, keeping close to the walls so that he wondered which table they were making for, and at the last minute making almost a little quick run to their particular seats. And again he thought of the ways and methods of cats.</p><p>Other small incidents, too, impressed him as all part of this queer, soft town with its muffled, indirect life, for the way some of the people appeared and disappeared with extraordinary swiftness puzzled him exceedingly. It may have been all perfectly natural, he knew, yet he could not make it out how the alleys swallowed them up and shot them forth in a second of time when there were no visible doorways or openings near enough to explain the phenomenon. Once he followed two elderly women who, he felt, had been particularly examining him from across the street--quite near the inn this was--and saw them turn the corner a few feet only in front of him. Yet when he sharply followed on their heels he saw nothing but an utterly deserted alley stretching in front of him with no sign of a living thing. And the only opening through which they could have escaped was a porch some fifty yards away, which not the swiftest human runner could have reached in time.</p><p>And in just such sudden fashion people appeared, when he never expected them. Once when he heard a great noise of fighting going on behind a low wall, and hurried up to see what was going on, what should he see but a group of girls and women engaged in vociferous conversation which instantly hushed itself to the normal whispering note of the town when his head appeared over the wall. And even then none of them turned to look at him directly, but slunk off with the most unaccountable rapidity into doors and sheds across the yard. And their voices, he thought, had sounded so like, so strangely like, the angry snarling of fighting animals, almost of cats.</p><p>The whole spirit of the town, however, continued to evade him as something elusive, protean, screened from the outer world, and at the same time intensely, genuinely vital; and, since he now formed part of its life, this concealment puzzled and irritated him; more--it began rather to frighten him.</p><p>Out of the mists that slowly gathered about his ordinary surface thoughts, there rose again the idea that the inhabitants were waiting for him to declare himself, to take an attitude, to do this, or to do that; and that when he had done so they in their turn would at length make some direct response, accepting or rejecting him. Yet the vital matter concerning which his decision was awaited came no nearer to him.</p><p>Once or twice he purposely followed little processions or groups of the citizens in order to find out, if possible, on what purpose they were bent; but they always discovered him in time and dwindled away, each individual going his or her own way. It was always the same: he never could learn what their main interest was. The cathedral was ever empty, the old church of St. Martin, at the other end of the town, deserted. They shopped because they had to, and not because they wished to. The booths stood neglected, the stalls unvisited, the little <em>cafes</em> desolate. Yet the streets were always full, the townsfolk ever on the bustle.</p><p>&quot;Can it be,&quot; he thought to himself, yet with a deprecating laugh that he should have dared to think anything so odd, &quot;can it be that these people are people of the twilight, that they live only at night their real life, and come out honestly only with the dusk? That during the day they make a sham though brave pretence, and after the sun is down their true life begins? Have they the souls of night-things, and is the whole blessed town in the hands of the cats?&quot;</p><p>The fancy somehow electrified him with little shocks of shrinking and dismay. Yet, though he affected to laugh, he knew that he was beginning to feel more than uneasy, and that strange forces were tugging with a thousand invisible cords at the very centre of his being. Something utterly remote from his ordinary life, something that had not waked for years, began faintly to stir in his soul, sending feelers abroad into his brain and heart, shaping queer thoughts and penetrating even into certain of his minor actions. Something exceedingly vital to himself, to his soul, hung in the balance.</p><p>And, always when he returned to the inn about the hour of sunset, he saw the figures of the townsfolk stealing through the dusk from their shop doors, moving sentry-wise to and fro at the corners of the streets, yet always vanishing silently like shadows at his near approach. And as the inn invariably closed its doors at ten o&#39;clock he had never yet found the opportunity he rather half-heartedly sought to see for himself what account the town could give of itself at night.</p><p>&quot;--<em>a cause du sommeil et a cause des chats</em>&quot;--the words now rang in his ears more and more often, though still as yet without any definite meaning.</p><p>Moreover, something made him sleep like the dead.</p><p>III</p><p>It was, I think, on the fifth day--though in this detail his story sometimes varied--that he made a definite discovery which increased his alarm and brought him up to a rather sharp climax. Before that he had already noticed that a change was going forward and certain subtle transformations being brought about in his character which modified several of his minor habits. And he had affected to ignore them. Here, however, was something he could no longer ignore; and it startled him.</p><p>At the best of times he was never very positive, always negative rather, compliant and acquiescent; yet, when necessity arose he was capable of reasonably vigorous action and could take a strongish decision. The discovery he now made that brought him up with such a sharp turn was that this power had positively dwindled to nothing. He found it impossible to make up his mind. For, on this fifth day, he realised that he had stayed long enough in the town and that for reasons he could only vaguely define to himself it was wiser <em>and safer</em> that he should leave.</p><p>And he found that he could not leave!</p><p>This is difficult to describe in words, and it was more by gesture and the expression of his face that he conveyed to Dr. Silence the state of impotence he had reached. All this spying and watching, he said, had as it were spun a net about his feet so that he was trapped and powerless to escape; he felt like a fly that had blundered into the intricacies of a great web; he was caught, imprisoned, and could not get away. It was a distressing sensation. A numbness had crept over his will till it had become almost incapable of decision. The mere thought of vigorous action--action towards escape--began to terrify him. All the currents of his life had turned inwards upon himself, striving to bring to the surface something that lay buried almost beyond reach, determined to force his recognition of something he had long forgotten--forgotten years upon years, centuries almost ago. It seemed as though a window deep within his being would presently open and reveal an entirely new world, yet somehow a world that was not unfamiliar. Beyond that, again, he fancied a great curtain hung; and when that too rolled up he would see still farther into this region and at last understand something of the secret life of these extraordinary people.</p><p>&quot;Is this why they wait and watch?&quot; he asked himself with rather a shaking heart, &quot;for the time when I shall join them--or refuse to join them? Does the decision rest with me after all, and not with them?&quot;</p><p>And it was at this point that the sinister character of the adventure first really declared itself, and he became genuinely alarmed. The stability of his rather fluid little personality was at stake, he felt, and something in his heart turned coward.</p><p>Why otherwise should he have suddenly taken to walking stealthily, silently, making as little sound as possible, for ever looking behind him? Why else should he have moved almost on tiptoe about the passages of the practically deserted inn, and when he was abroad have found himself deliberately taking advantage of what cover presented itself? And why, if he was not afraid, should the wisdom of staying indoors after sundown have suddenly occurred to him as eminently desirable? Why, indeed?</p><p>And, when John Silence gently pressed him for an explanation of these things, he admitted apologetically that he had none to give.</p><p>&quot;It was simply that I feared something might happen to me unless I kept a sharp look-out. I felt afraid. It was instinctive,&quot; was all he could say. &quot;I got the impression that the whole town was after me--wanted me for something; and that if it got me I should lose myself, or at least the Self I knew, in some unfamiliar state of consciousness. But I am not a psychologist, you know,&quot; he added meekly, &quot;and I cannot define it better than that.&quot;</p><p>It was while lounging in the courtyard half an hour before the evening meal that Vezin made this discovery, and he at once went upstairs to his quiet room at the end of the winding passage to think it over alone. In the yard it was empty enough, true, but there was always the possibility that the big woman whom he dreaded would come out of some door, with her pretence of knitting, to sit and watch him. This had happened several times, and he could not endure the sight of her. He still remembered his original fancy, bizarre though it was, that she would spring upon him the moment his back was turned and land with one single crushing leap upon his neck. Of course it was nonsense, but then it haunted him, and once an idea begins to do that it ceases to be nonsense. It has clothed itself in reality.</p><p>He went upstairs accordingly. It was dusk, and the oil lamps had not yet been lit in the passages. He stumbled over the uneven surface of the ancient flooring, passing the dim outlines of doors along the corridor--doors that he had never once seen opened--rooms that seemed never occupied. He moved, as his habit now was, stealthily and on tiptoe.</p><p>Half-way down the last passage to his own chamber there was a sharp turn, and it was just here, while groping round the walls with outstretched hands, that his fingers touched something that was not wall--something that moved. It was soft and warm in texture, indescribably fragrant, and about the height of his shoulder; and he immediately thought of a furry, sweet-smelling kitten. The next minute he knew it was something quite different.</p><p>Instead of investigating, however,--his nerves must have been too overwrought for that, he said,--he shrank back as closely as possible against the wall on the other side. The thing, whatever it was, slipped past him with a sound of rustling and, retreating with light footsteps down the passage behind him, was gone. A breath of warm, scented air was wafted to his nostrils.</p><p>Vezin caught his breath for an instant and paused, stockstill, half leaning against the wall--and then almost ran down the remaining distance and entered his room with a rush, locking the door hurriedly behind him. Yet it was not fear that made him run: it was excitement, pleasurable excitement. His nerves were tingling, and a delicious glow made itself felt all over his body. In a flash it came to him that this was just what he had felt twenty-five years ago as a boy when he was in love for the first time. Warm currents of life ran all over him and mounted to his brain in a whirl of soft delight. His mood was suddenly become tender, melting, loving.</p><p>The room was quite dark, and he collapsed upon the sofa by the window, wondering what had happened to him and what it all meant. But the only thing he understood clearly in that instant was that something in him had swiftly, magically changed: he no longer wished to leave, or to argue with himself about leaving. The encounter in the passage-way had changed all that. The strange perfume of it still hung about him, bemusing his heart and mind. For he knew that it was a girl who had passed him, a girl&#39;s face that his fingers had brushed in the darkness, and he felt in some extraordinary way as though he had been actually kissed by her, kissed full upon the lips.</p><p>Trembling, he sat upon the sofa by the window and struggled to collect his thoughts. He was utterly unable to understand how the mere passing of a girl in the darkness of a narrow passage-way could communicate so electric a thrill to his whole being that he still shook with the sweetness of it. Yet, there it was! And he found it as useless to deny as to attempt analysis. Some ancient fire had entered his veins, and now ran coursing through his blood; and that he was forty-five instead of twenty did not matter one little jot. Out of all the inner turmoil and confusion emerged the one salient fact that the mere atmosphere, the merest casual touch, of this girl, unseen, unknown in the darkness, had been sufficient to stir dormant fires in the centre of his heart, and rouse his whole being from a state of feeble sluggishness to one of tearing and tumultuous excitement.</p><p>After a time, however, the number of Vezin&#39;s years began to assert their cumulative power; he grew calmer, and when a knock came at length upon his door and he heard the waiter&#39;s voice suggesting that dinner was nearly over, he pulled himself together and slowly made his way downstairs into the dining-room.</p><p>Every one looked up as he entered, for he was very late, but he took his customary seat in the far corner and began to eat. The trepidation was still in his nerves, but the fact that he had passed through the courtyard and hall without catching sight of a petticoat served to calm him a little. He ate so fast that he had almost caught up with the current stage of the table d&#39;hote, when a slight commotion in the room drew his attention.</p><p>His chair was so placed that the door and the greater portion of the long <em>salle a manger</em> were behind him, yet it was not necessary to turn round to know that the same person he had passed in the dark passage had now come into the room. He felt the presence long before he heard or saw any one. Then he became aware that the old men, the only other guests, were rising one by one in their places, and exchanging greetings with some one who passed among them from table to table. And when at length he turned with his heart beating furiously to ascertain for himself, he saw the form of a young girl, lithe and slim, moving down the centre of the room and making straight for his own table in the corner. She moved wonderfully, with sinuous grace, like a young panther, and her approach filled him with such delicious bewilderment that he was utterly unable to tell at first what her face was like, or discover what it was about the whole presentment of the creature that filled him anew with trepidation and delight.</p><p>&quot;Ah, Ma&#39;mselle est de retour!&quot; he heard the old waiter murmur at his side, and he was just able to take in that she was the daughter of the proprietress, when she was upon him, and he heard her voice. She was addressing him. Something of red lips he saw and laughing white teeth, and stray wisps of fine dark hair about the temples; but all the rest was a dream in which his own emotion rose like a thick cloud before his eyes and prevented his seeing accurately, or knowing exactly what he did. He was aware that she greeted him with a charming little bow; that her beautiful large eyes looked searchingly into his own; that the perfume he had noticed in the dark passage again assailed his nostrils, and that she was bending a little towards him and leaning with one hand on the table at this side. She was quite close to him--that was the chief thing he knew--explaining that she had been asking after the comfort of her mother&#39;s guests, and now was introducing herself to the latest arrival--himself.</p><p>&quot;M&#39;sieur has already been here a few days,&quot; he heard the waiter say; and then her own voice, sweet as singing, replied--</p><p>&quot;Ah, but M&#39;sieur is not going to leave us just yet, I hope. My mother is too old to look after the comfort of our guests properly, but now I am here I will remedy all that.&quot; She laughed deliciously. &quot;M&#39;sieur shall be well looked after.&quot;</p><p>Vezin, struggling with his emotion and desire to be polite, half rose to acknowledge the pretty speech, and to stammer some sort of reply, but as he did so his hand by chance touched her own that was resting upon the table, and a shock that was for all the world like a shock of electricity, passed from her skin into his body. His soul wavered and shook deep within him. He caught her eyes fixed upon his own with a look of most curious intentness, and the next moment he knew that he had sat down wordless again on his chair, that the girl was already half-way across the room, and that he was trying to eat his salad with a dessert-spoon and a knife.</p><p>Longing for her return, and yet dreading it, he gulped down the remainder of his dinner, and then went at once to his bedroom to be alone with his thoughts. This time the passages were lighted, and he suffered no exciting contretemps; yet the winding corridor was dim with shadows, and the last portion, from the bend of the walls onwards, seemed longer than he had ever known it. It ran downhill like the pathway on a mountain side, and as he tiptoed softly down it he felt that by rights it ought to have led him clean out of the house into the heart of a great forest. The world was singing with him. Strange fancies filled his brain, and once in the room, with the door securely locked, he did not light the candles, but sat by the open window thinking long, long thoughts that came unbidden in troops to his mind.</p><p>IV</p><p>This part of the story he told to Dr. Silence, without special coaxing, it is true, yet with much stammering embarrassment. He could not in the least understand, he said, how the girl had managed to affect him so profoundly, and even before he had set eyes upon her. For her mere proximity in the darkness had been sufficient to set him on fire. He knew nothing of enchantments, and for years had been a stranger to anything approaching tender relations with any member of the opposite sex, for he was encased in shyness, and realised his overwhelming defects only too well. Yet this bewitching young creature came to him deliberately. Her manner was unmistakable, and she sought him out on every possible occasion. Chaste and sweet she was undoubtedly, yet frankly inviting; and she won him utterly with the first glance of her shining eyes, even if she had not already done so in the dark merely by the magic of her invisible presence.</p><p>&quot;You felt she was altogether wholesome and good!&quot; queried the doctor. &quot;You had no reaction of any sort--for instance, of alarm?&quot;</p><p>Vezin looked up sharply with one of his inimitable little apologetic smiles. It was some time before he replied. The mere memory of the adventure had suffused his shy face with blushes, and his brown eyes sought the floor again before he answered.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think I can quite say that,&quot; he explained presently. &quot;I acknowledged certain qualms, sitting up in my room afterwards. A conviction grew upon me that there was something about her--how shall I express it?--well, something unholy. It is not impurity in any sense, physical or mental, that I mean, but something quite indefinable that gave me a vague sensation of the creeps. She drew me, and at the same time repelled me, more than--than--&quot;</p><p>He hesitated, blushing furiously, and unable to finish the sentence.</p><p>&quot;Nothing like it has ever come to me before or since,&quot; he concluded, with lame confusion. &quot;I suppose it was, as you suggested just now, something of an enchantment. At any rate, it was strong enough to make me feel that I would stay in that awful little haunted town for years if only I could see her every day, hear her voice, watch her wonderful movements, and sometimes, perhaps, touch her hand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you explain to me what you felt was the source of her power?&quot; John Silence asked, looking purposely anywhere but at the narrator.</p><p>&quot;I am surprised that you should ask me such a question,&quot; answered Vezin, with the nearest approach to dignity he could manage. &quot;I think no man can describe to another convincingly wherein lies the magic of the woman who ensnares him. I certainly cannot. I can only say this slip of a girl bewitched me, and the mere knowledge that she was living and sleeping in the same house filled me with an extraordinary sense of delight.</p><p>&quot;But there&#39;s one thing I can tell you,&quot; he went on earnestly, his eyes aglow, &quot;namely, that she seemed to sum up and synthesise in herself all the strange hidden forces that operated so mysteriously in the town and its inhabitants. She had the silken movements of the panther, going smoothly, silently to and fro, and the same indirect, oblique methods as the townsfolk, screening, like them, secret purposes of her own--purposes that I was sure had <em>me</em> for their objective. She kept me, to my terror and delight, ceaselessly under observation, yet so carelessly, so consummately, that another man less sensitive, if I may say so&quot;--he made a deprecating gesture--&quot;or less prepared by what had gone before, would never have noticed it at all. She was always still, always reposeful, yet she seemed to be everywhere at once, so that I never could escape from her. I was continually meeting the stare and laughter of her great eyes, in the corners of the rooms, in the passages, calmly looking at me through the windows, or in the busiest parts of the public streets.&quot;</p><p>Their intimacy, it seems, grew very rapidly after this first encounter which had so violently disturbed the little man&#39;s equilibrium. He was naturally very prim, and prim folk live mostly in so small a world that anything violently unusual may shake them clean out of it, and they therefore instinctively distrust originality. But Vezin began to forget his primness after awhile. The girl was always modestly behaved, and as her mother&#39;s representative she naturally had to do with the guests in the hotel. It was not out of the way that a spirit of camaraderie should spring up. Besides, she was young, she was charmingly pretty, she was French, and--she obviously liked him.</p><p>At the same time, there was something indescribable--a certain indefinable atmosphere of other places, other times--that made him try hard to remain on his guard, and sometimes made him catch his breath with a sudden start. It was all rather like a delirious dream, half delight, half dread, he confided in a whisper to Dr. Silence; and more than once he hardly knew quite what he was doing or saying, as though he were driven forward by impulses he scarcely recognised as his own.</p><p>And though the thought of leaving presented itself again and again to his mind, it was each time with less insistence, so that he stayed on from day to day, becoming more and more a part of the sleepy life of this dreamy mediaeval town, losing more and more of his recognisable personality. Soon, he felt, the Curtain within would roll up with an awful rush, and he would find himself suddenly admitted into the secret purposes of the hidden life that lay behind it all. Only, by that time, he would have become transformed into an entirely different being.</p><p>And, meanwhile, he noticed various little signs of the intention to make his stay attractive to him: flowers in his bedroom, a more comfortable arm-chair in the corner, and even special little extra dishes on his private table in the dining-room. Conversations, too, with &quot;Mademoiselle Ilse&quot; became more and more frequent and pleasant, and although they seldom travelled beyond the weather, or the details of the town, the girl, he noticed, was never in a hurry to bring them to an end, and often contrived to interject little odd sentences that he never properly understood, yet felt to be significant.</p><p>And it was these stray remarks, full of a meaning that evaded him, that pointed to some hidden purpose of her own and made him feel uneasy. They all had to do, he felt sure, with reasons for his staying on in the town indefinitely.</p><p>&quot;And has M&#39;sieur not even yet come to a decision?&quot; she said softly in his ear, sitting beside him in the sunny yard before <em>dejeuner</em>, the acquaintance having progressed with significant rapidity. &quot;Because, if it&#39;s so difficult, we must all try together to help him!&quot;</p><p>The question startled him, following upon his own thoughts. It was spoken with a pretty laugh, and a stray bit of hair across one eye, as she turned and peered at him half roguishly. Possibly he did not quite understand the French of it, for her near presence always confused his small knowledge of the language distressingly. Yet the words, and her manner, and something else that lay behind it all in her mind, frightened him. It gave such point to his feeling that the town was waiting for him to make his mind up on some important matter.</p><p>At the same time, her voice, and the fact that she was there so close beside him in her soft dark dress, thrilled him inexpressibly.</p><p>&quot;It is true I find it difficult to leave,&quot; he stammered, losing his way deliciously in the depths of her eyes, &quot;and especially now that Mademoiselle Ilse has come.&quot;</p><p>He was surprised at the success of his sentence, and quite delighted with the little gallantry of it. But at the same time he could have bitten his tongue off for having said it.</p><p>&quot;Then after all you like our little town, or you would not be pleased to stay on,&quot; she said, ignoring the compliment.</p><p>&quot;I am enchanted with it, and enchanted with you,&quot; he cried, feeling that his tongue was somehow slipping beyond the control of his brain. And he was on the verge of saying all manner of other things of the wildest description, when the girl sprang lightly up from her chair beside him, and made to go.</p><p>&quot;It is <em>soupe a l&#39;onion</em> to-day!&quot; she cried, laughing back at him through the sunlight, &quot;and I must go and see about it. Otherwise, you know, M&#39;sieur will not enjoy his dinner, and then, perhaps, he will leave us!&quot;</p><p>He watched her cross the courtyard, moving with all the grace and lightness of the feline race, and her simple black dress clothed her, he thought, exactly like the fur of the same supple species. She turned once to laugh at him from the porch with the glass door, and then stopped a moment to speak to her mother, who sat knitting as usual in her corner seat just inside the hall-way.</p><p>But how was it, then, that the moment his eye fell upon this ungainly woman, the pair of them appeared suddenly as other than they were? Whence came that transforming dignity and sense of power that enveloped them both as by magic? What was it about that massive woman that made her appear instantly regal, and set her on a throne in some dark and dreadful scenery, wielding a sceptre over the red glare of some tempestuous orgy? And why did this slender stripling of a girl, graceful as a willow, lithe as a young leopard, assume suddenly an air of sinister majesty, and move with flame and smoke about her head, and the darkness of night beneath her feet?</p><p>Vezin caught his breath and sat there transfixed. Then, almost simultaneously with its appearance, the queer notion vanished again, and the sunlight of day caught them both, and he heard her laughing to her mother about the <em>soupe a l&#39;onion</em>, and saw her glancing back at him over her dear little shoulder with a smile that made him think of a dew-kissed rose bending lightly before summer airs.</p><p>And, indeed, the onion soup was particularly excellent that day, because he saw another cover laid at his small table, and, with fluttering heart, heard the waiter murmur by way of explanation that &quot;Ma&#39;mselle Ilse would honour M&#39;sieur to-day at <em>dejeuner</em>, as her custom sometimes is with her mother&#39;s guests.&quot;</p><p>So actually she sat by him all through that delirious meal, talking quietly to him in easy French, seeing that he was well looked after, mixing the salad-dressing, and even helping him with her own hand. And, later in the afternoon, while he was smoking in the courtyard, longing for a sight of her as soon as her duties were done, she came again to his side, and when he rose to meet her, she stood facing him a moment, full of a perplexing sweet shyness before she spoke--</p><p>&quot;My mother thinks you ought to know more of the beauties of our little town, and <em>I</em> think so too! Would M&#39;sieur like me to be his guide, perhaps? I can show him everything, for our family has lived here for many generations.&quot;</p><p>She had him by the hand, indeed, before he could find a single word to express his pleasure, and led him, all unresisting, out into the street, yet in such a way that it seemed perfectly natural she should do so, and without the faintest suggestion of boldness or immodesty. Her face glowed with the pleasure and interest of it, and with her short dress and tumbled hair she looked every bit the charming child of seventeen that she was, innocent and playful, proud of her native town, and alive beyond her years to the sense of its ancient beauty.</p><p>So they went over the town together, and she showed him what she considered its chief interest: the tumble-down old house where her forebears had lived; the sombre, aristocratic-looking mansion where her mother&#39;s family dwelt for centuries, and the ancient market-place where several hundred years before the witches had been burnt by the score. She kept up a lively running stream of talk about it all, of which he understood not a fiftieth part as he trudged along by her side, cursing his forty-five years and feeling all the yearnings of his early manhood revive and jeer at him. And, as she talked, England and Surbiton seemed very far away indeed, almost in another age of the world&#39;s history. Her voice touched something immeasurably old in him, something that slept deep. It lulled the surface parts of his consciousness to sleep, allowing what was far more ancient to awaken. Like the town, with its elaborate pretence of modern active life, the upper layers of his being became dulled, soothed, muffled, and what lay underneath began to stir in its sleep. That big Curtain swayed a little to and fro. Presently it might lift altogether....</p><p>He began to understand a little better at last. The mood of the town was reproducing itself in him. In proportion as his ordinary external self became muffled, that inner secret life, that was far more real and vital, asserted itself. And this girl was surely the high-priestess of it all, the chief instrument of its accomplishment. New thoughts, with new interpretations, flooded his mind as she walked beside him through the winding streets, while the picturesque old gabled town, softly coloured in the sunset, had never appeared to him so wholly wonderful and seductive.</p><p>And only one curious incident came to disturb and puzzle him, slight in itself, but utterly inexplicable, bringing white terror into the child&#39;s face and a scream to her laughing lips. He had merely pointed to a column of blue smoke that rose from the burning autumn leaves and made a picture against the red roofs, and had then run to the wall and called her to his side to watch the flames shooting here and there through the heap of rubbish. Yet, at the sight of it, as though taken by surprise, her face had altered dreadfully, and she had turned and run like the wind, calling out wild sentences to him as she ran, of which he had not understood a single word, except that the fire apparently frightened her, and she wanted to get quickly away from it, and to get him away too.</p><p>Yet five minutes later she was as calm and happy again as though nothing had happened to alarm or waken troubled thoughts in her, and they had both forgotten the incident.</p><p>They were leaning over the ruined ramparts together listening to the weird music of the band as he had heard it the first day of his arrival. It moved him again profoundly as it had done before, and somehow he managed to find his tongue and his best French. The girl leaned across the stones close beside him. No one was about. Driven by some remorseless engine within he began to stammer something--he hardly knew what--of his strange admiration for her. Almost at the first word she sprang lightly off the wall and came up smiling in front of him, just touching his knees as he sat there. She was hatless as usual, and the sun caught her hair and one side of her cheek and throat.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so glad!&quot; she cried, clapping her little hands softly in his face, &quot;so very glad, because that means that if you like me you must also like what I do, and what I belong to.&quot;</p><p>Already he regretted bitterly having lost control of himself. Something in the phrasing of her sentence chilled him. He knew the fear of embarking upon an unknown and dangerous sea.</p><p>&quot;You will take part in our real life, I mean,&quot; she added softly, with an indescribable coaxing of manner, as though she noticed his shrinking. &quot;You will come back to us.&quot;</p><p>Already this slip of a child seemed to dominate him; he felt her power coming over him more and more; something emanated from her that stole over his senses and made him aware that her personality, for all its simple grace, held forces that were stately, imposing, august. He saw her again moving through smoke and flame amid broken and tempestuous scenery, alarmingly strong, her terrible mother by her side. Dimly this shone through her smile and appearance of charming innocence.</p><p>&quot;You will, I know,&quot; she repeated, holding him with her eyes.</p><p>They were quite alone up there on the ramparts, and the sensation that she was overmastering him stirred a wild sensuousness in his blood. The mingled abandon and reserve in her attracted him furiously, and all of him that was man rose up and resisted the creeping influence, at the same time acclaiming it with the full delight of his forgotten youth. An irresistible desire came to him to question her, to summon what still remained to him of his own little personality in an effort to retain the right to his normal self.</p><p>The girl had grown quiet again, and was now leaning on the broad wall close beside him, gazing out across the darkening plain, her elbows on the coping, motionless as a figure carved in stone. He took his courage in both hands.</p><p>&quot;Tell me, Ilse,&quot; he said, unconsciously imitating her own purring softness of voice, yet aware that he was utterly in earnest, &quot;what is the meaning of this town, and what is this real life you speak of? And why is it that the people watch me from morning to night? Tell me what it all means? And, tell me,&quot; he added more quickly with passion in his voice, &quot;what you really are--yourself?&quot;</p><p>She turned her head and looked at him through half-closed eyelids, her growing inner excitement betraying itself by the faint colour that ran like a shadow across her face.</p><p>&quot;It seems to me,&quot;--he faltered oddly under her gaze--&quot;that I have some right to know--&quot;</p><p>Suddenly she opened her eyes to the full. &quot;You love me, then?&quot; she asked softly.</p><p>&quot;I swear,&quot; he cried impetuously, moved as by the force of a rising tide, &quot;I never felt before--I have never known any other girl who--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then you <em>have</em> the right to know,&quot; she calmly interrupted his confused confession, &quot;for love shares all secrets.&quot;</p><p>She paused, and a thrill like fire ran swiftly through him. Her words lifted him off the earth, and he felt a radiant happiness, followed almost the same instant in horrible contrast by the thought of death. He became aware that she had turned her eyes upon his own and was speaking again.</p><p>&quot;The real life I speak of,&quot; she whispered, &quot;is the old, old life within, the life of long ago, the life to which you, too, once belonged, and to which you still belong.&quot;</p><p>A faint wave of memory troubled the deeps of his soul as her low voice sank into him. What she was saying he knew instinctively to be true, even though he could not as yet understand its full purport. His present life seemed slipping from him as he listened, merging his personality in one that was far older and greater. It was this loss of his present self that brought to him the thought of death.</p><p>&quot;You came here,&quot; she went on, &quot;with the purpose of seeking it, and the people felt your presence and are waiting to know what you decide, whether you will leave them without having found it, or whether--&quot;</p><p>Her eyes remained fixed upon his own, but her face began to change, growing larger and darker with an expression of age.</p><p>&quot;It is their thoughts constantly playing about your soul that makes you feel they watch you. They do not watch you with their eyes. The purposes of their inner life are calling to you, seeking to claim you. You were all part of the same life long, long ago, and now they want you back again among them.&quot;</p><p>Vezin&#39;s timid heart sank with dread as he listened; but the girl&#39;s eyes held him with a net of joy so that he had no wish to escape. She fascinated him, as it were, clean out of his normal self.</p><p>&quot;Alone, however, the people could never have caught and held you,&quot; she resumed. &quot;The motive force was not strong enough; it has faded through all these years. But I&quot;--she paused a moment and looked at him with complete confidence in her splendid eyes--&quot;I possess the spell to conquer you and hold you: the spell of old love. I can win you back again and make you live the old life with me, for the force of the ancient tie between us, if I choose to use it, is irresistible. And I do choose to use it. I still want you. And you, dear soul of my dim past&quot;--she pressed closer to him so that her breath passed across his eyes, and her voice positively sang--&quot;I mean to have you, for you love me and are utterly at my mercy.&quot;</p><p>Vezin heard, and yet did not hear; understood, yet did not understand. He had passed into a condition of exaltation. The world was beneath his feet, made of music and flowers, and he was flying somewhere far above it through the sunshine of pure delight. He was breathless and giddy with the wonder of her words. They intoxicated him. And, still, the terror of it all, the dreadful thought of death, pressed ever behind her sentences. For flames shot through her voice out of black smoke and licked at his soul.</p><p>And they communicated with one another, it seemed to him, by a process of swift telepathy, for his French could never have compassed all he said to her. Yet she understood perfectly, and what she said to him was like the recital of verses long since known. And the mingled pain and sweetness of it as he listened were almost more than his little soul could hold.</p><p>&quot;Yet I came here wholly by chance--&quot; he heard himself saying.</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; she cried with passion, &quot;you came here because I called to you. I have called to you for years, and you came with the whole force of the past behind you. You had to come, for I own you, and I claim you.&quot;</p><p>She rose again and moved closer, looking at him with a certain insolence in the face--the insolence of power.</p><p>The sun had set behind the towers of the old cathedral and the darkness rose up from the plain and enveloped them. The music of the band had ceased. The leaves of the plane trees hung motionless, but the chill of the autumn evening rose about them and made Vezin shiver. There was no sound but the sound of their voices and the occasional soft rustle of the girl&#39;s dress. He could hear the blood rushing in his ears. He scarcely realised where he was or what he was doing. Some terrible magic of the imagination drew him deeply down into the tombs of his own being, telling him in no unfaltering voice that her words shadowed forth the truth. And this simple little French maid, speaking beside him with so strange authority, he saw curiously alter into quite another being. As he stared into her eyes, the picture in his mind grew and lived, dressing itself vividly to his inner vision with a degree of reality he was compelled to acknowledge. As once before, he saw her tall and stately, moving through wild and broken scenery of forests and mountain caverns, the glare of flames behind her head and clouds of shifting smoke about her feet. Dark leaves encircled her hair, flying loosely in the wind, and her limbs shone through the merest rags of clothing. Others were about her, too, and ardent eyes on all sides cast delirious glances upon her, but her own eyes were always for One only, one whom she held by the hand. For she was leading the dance in some tempestuous orgy to the music of chanting voices, and the dance she led circled about a great and awful Figure on a throne, brooding over the scene through lurid vapours, while innumerable other wild faces and forms crowded furiously about her in the dance. But the one she held by the hand he knew to be himself, and the monstrous shape upon the throne he knew to be her mother.</p><p>The vision rose within him, rushing to him down the long years of buried time, crying aloud to him with the voice of memory reawakened.... And then the scene faded away and he saw the clear circle of the girl&#39;s eyes gazing steadfastly into his own, and she became once more the pretty little daughter of the innkeeper, and he found his voice again.</p><p>&quot;And you,&quot; he whispered tremblingly--&quot;you child of visions and enchantment, how is it that you so bewitch me that I loved you even before I saw?&quot;</p><p>She drew herself up beside him with an air of rare dignity.</p><p>&quot;The call of the Past,&quot; she said; &quot;and besides,&quot; she added proudly, &quot;in the real life I am a princess--&quot;</p><p>&quot;A princess!&quot; he cried.</p><p>&quot;--and my mother is a queen!&quot;</p><p>At this, little Vezin utterly lost his head. Delight tore at his heart and swept him into sheer ecstasy. To hear that sweet singing voice, and to see those adorable little lips utter such things, upset his balance beyond all hope of control. He took her in his arms and covered her unresisting face with kisses.</p><p>But even while he did so, and while the hot passion swept him, he felt that she was soft and loathsome, and that her answering kisses stained his very soul.... And when, presently, she had freed herself and vanished into the darkness, he stood there, leaning against the wall in a state of collapse, creeping with horror from the touch of her yielding body, and inwardly raging at the weakness that he already dimly realised must prove his undoing.</p><p>And from the shadows of the old buildings into which she disappeared there rose in the stillness of the night a singular, long-drawn cry, which at first he took for laughter, but which later he was sure he recognised as the almost human wailing of a cat.</p><p>V</p><p>For a long time Vezin leant there against the wall, alone with his surging thoughts and emotions. He understood at length that he had done the one thing necessary to call down upon him the whole force of this ancient Past. For in those passionate kisses he had acknowledged the tie of olden days, and had revived it. And the memory of that soft impalpable caress in the darkness of the inn corridor came back to him with a shudder. The girl had first mastered him, and then led him to the one act that was necessary for her purpose. He had been waylaid, after the lapse of centuries--caught, and conquered.</p><p>Dimly he realised this, and sought to make plans for his escape. But, for the moment at any rate, he was powerless to manage his thoughts or will, for the sweet, fantastic madness of the whole adventure mounted to his brain like a spell, and he gloried in the feeling that he was utterly enchanted and moving in a world so much larger and wilder than the one he had ever been accustomed to.</p><p>The moon, pale and enormous, was just rising over the sea-like plain, when at last he rose to go. Her slanting rays drew all the houses into new perspective, so that their roofs, already glistening with dew, seemed to stretch much higher into the sky than usual, and their gables and quaint old towers lay far away in its purple reaches.</p><p>The cathedral appeared unreal in a silver mist. He moved softly, keeping to the shadows; but the streets were all deserted and very silent; the doors were closed, the shutters fastened. Not a soul was astir. The hush of night lay over everything; it was like a town of the dead, a churchyard with gigantic and grotesque tombstones.</p><p>Wondering where all the busy life of the day had so utterly disappeared to, he made his way to a back door that entered the inn by means of the stables, thinking thus to reach his room unobserved. He reached the courtyard safely and crossed it by keeping close to the shadow of the wall. He sidled down it, mincing along on tiptoe, just as the old men did when they entered the <em>salle a manger</em>. He was horrified to find himself doing this instinctively. A strange impulse came to him, catching him somehow in the centre of his body--an impulse to drop upon all fours and run swiftly and silently. He glanced upwards and the idea came to him to leap up upon his window-sill overhead instead of going round by the stairs. This occurred to him as the easiest, and most natural way. It was like the beginning of some horrible transformation of himself into something else. He was fearfully strung up.</p><p>The moon was higher now, and the shadows very dark along the side of the street where he moved. He kept among the deepest of them, and reached the porch with the glass doors.</p><p>But here there was light; the inmates, unfortunately, were still about. Hoping to slip across the hall unobserved and reach the stairs, he opened the door carefully and stole in. Then he saw that the hall was not empty. A large dark thing lay against the wall on his left. At first he thought it must be household articles. Then it moved, and he thought it was an immense cat, distorted in some way by the play of light and shadow. Then it rose straight up before him and he saw that it was the proprietress.</p><p>What she had been doing in this position he could only venture a dreadful guess, but the moment she stood up and faced him he was aware of some terrible dignity clothing her about that instantly recalled the girl&#39;s strange saying that she was a queen. Huge and sinister she stood there under the little oil lamp; alone with him in the empty hall. Awe stirred in his heart, and the roots of some ancient fear. He felt that he must bow to her and make some kind of obeisance. The impulse was fierce and irresistible, as of long habit. He glanced quickly about him. There was no one there. Then he deliberately inclined his head toward her. He bowed.</p><p>&quot;Enfin! M&#39;sieur s&#39;est donc decide. C&#39;est bien alors. J&#39;en suis contente.&quot;</p><p>Her words came to him sonorously as through a great open space.</p><p>Then the great figure came suddenly across the flagged hall at him and seized his trembling hands. Some overpowering force moved with her and caught him.</p><p>&quot;On pourrait faire un p&#39;tit tour ensemble, n&#39;est-ce pas? Nous y allons cette nuit et il faut s&#39;exercer un peu d&#39;avance pour cela. Ilse, Ilse, viens donc ici. Viens vite!&quot;</p><p>And she whirled him round in the opening steps of some dance that seemed oddly and horribly familiar. They made no sound on the stones, this strangely assorted couple. It was all soft and stealthy. And presently, when the air seemed to thicken like smoke, and a red glare as of flame shot through it, he was aware that some one else had joined them and that his hand the mother had released was now tightly held by the daughter. Ilse had come in answer to the call, and he saw her with leaves of vervain twined in her dark hair, clothed in tattered vestiges of some curious garment, beautiful as the night, and horribly, odiously, loathsomely seductive.</p><p>&quot;To the Sabbath! to the Sabbath!&quot; they cried. &quot;On to the Witches&#39; Sabbath!&quot;</p><p>Up and down that narrow hall they danced, the women on each side of him, to the wildest measure he had ever imagined, yet which he dimly, dreadfully remembered, till the lamp on the wall flickered and went out, and they were left in total darkness. And the devil woke in his heart with a thousand vile suggestions and made him afraid.</p><p>Suddenly they released his hands and he heard the voice of the mother cry that it was time, and they must go. Which way they went he did not pause to see. He only realised that he was free, and he blundered through the darkness till he found the stairs and then tore up them to his room as though all hell was at his heels.</p><p>He flung himself on the sofa, with his face in his hands, and groaned. Swiftly reviewing a dozen ways of immediate escape, all equally impossible, he finally decided that the only thing to do for the moment was to sit quiet and wait. He must see what was going to happen. At least in the privacy of his own bedroom he would be fairly safe. The door was locked. He crossed over and softly opened the window which gave upon the courtyard and also permitted a partial view of the hall through the glass doors.</p><p>As he did so the hum and murmur of a great activity reached his ears from the streets beyond--the sound of footsteps and voices muffled by distance. He leaned out cautiously and listened. The moonlight was clear and strong now, but his own window was in shadow, the silver disc being still behind the house. It came to him irresistibly that the inhabitants of the town, who a little while before had all been invisible behind closed doors, were now issuing forth, busy upon some secret and unholy errand. He listened intently.</p><p>At first everything about him was silent, but soon he became aware of movements going on in the house itself. Rustlings and cheepings came to him across that still, moonlit yard. A concourse of living beings sent the hum of their activity into the night. Things were on the move everywhere. A biting, pungent odour rose through the air, coming he knew not whence. Presently his eyes became glued to the windows of the opposite wall where the moonshine fell in a soft blaze. The roof overhead, and behind him, was reflected clearly in the panes of glass, and he saw the outlines of dark bodies moving with long footsteps over the tiles and along the coping. They passed swiftly and silently, shaped like immense cats, in an endless procession across the pictured glass, and then appeared to leap down to a lower level where he lost sight of them. He just caught the soft thudding of their leaps. Sometimes their shadows fell upon the white wall opposite, and then he could not make out whether they were the shadows of human beings or of cats. They seemed to change swiftly from one to the other. The transformation looked horribly real, for they leaped like human beings, yet changed swiftly in the air immediately afterwards, and dropped like animals.</p><p>The yard, too, beneath him, was now alive with the creeping movements of dark forms all stealthily drawing towards the porch with the glass doors. They kept so closely to the wall that he could not determine their actual shape, but when he saw that they passed on to the great congregation that was gathering in the hall, he understood that these were the creatures whose leaping shadows he had first seen reflected in the windowpanes opposite. They were coming from all parts of the town, reaching the appointed meeting-place across the roofs and tiles, and springing from level to level till they came to the yard.</p><p>Then a new sound caught his ear, and he saw that the windows all about him were being softly opened, and that to each window came a face. A moment later figures began dropping hurriedly down into the yard. And these figures, as they lowered themselves down from the windows, were human, he saw; but once safely in the yard they fell upon all fours and changed in the swiftest possible second into--cats--huge, silent cats. They ran in streams to join the main body in the hall beyond.</p><p>So, after all, the rooms in the house had not been empty and unoccupied.</p><p>Moreover, what he saw no longer filled him with amazement. For he remembered it all. It was familiar. It had all happened before just so, hundreds of times, and he himself had taken part in it and known the wild madness of it all. The outline of the old building changed, the yard grew larger, and he seemed to be staring down upon it from a much greater height through smoky vapours. And, as he looked, half remembering, the old pains of long ago, fierce and sweet, furiously assailed him, and the blood stirred horribly as he heard the Call of the Dance again in his heart and tasted the ancient magic of Ilse whirling by his side.</p><p>Suddenly he started back. A great lithe cat had leaped softly up from the shadows below on to the sill close to his face, and was staring fixedly at him with the eyes of a human. &quot;Come,&quot; it seemed to say, &quot;come with us to the Dance! Change as of old! Transform yourself swiftly and come!&quot; Only too well he understood the creature&#39;s soundless call.</p><p>It was gone again in a flash with scarcely a sound of its padded feet on the stones, and then others dropped by the score down the side of the house, past his very eyes, all changing as they fell and darting away rapidly, softly, towards the gathering point. And again he felt the dreadful desire to do likewise; to murmur the old incantation, and then drop upon hands and knees and run swiftly for the great flying leap into the air. Oh, how the passion of it rose within him like a flood, twisting his very entrails, sending his heart&#39;s desire flaming forth into the night for the old, old Dance of the Sorcerers at the Witches&#39; Sabbath! The whirl of the stars was about him; once more he met the magic of the moon. The power of the wind, rushing from precipice and forest, leaping from cliff to cliff across the valleys, tore him away.... He heard the cries of the dancers and their wild laughter, and with this savage girl in his embrace he danced furiously about the dim Throne where sat the Figure with the sceptre of majesty....</p><p>Then, suddenly, all became hushed and still, and the fever died down a little in his heart. The calm moonlight flooded a courtyard empty and deserted. They had started. The procession was off into the sky. And he was left behind--alone.</p><p>Vezin tiptoed softly across the room and unlocked the door. The murmur from the streets, growing momentarily as he advanced, met his ears. He made his way with the utmost caution down the corridor. At the head of the stairs he paused and listened. Below him, the hall where they had gathered was dark and still, but through opened doors and windows on the far side of the building came the sound of a great throng moving farther and farther into the distance.</p><p>He made his way down the creaking wooden stairs, dreading yet longing to meet some straggler who should point the way, but finding no one; across the dark hall, so lately thronged with living, moving things, and out through the opened front doors into the street. He could not believe that he was really left behind, really forgotten, that he had been purposely permitted to escape. It perplexed him.</p><p>Nervously he peered about him, and up and down the street; then, seeing nothing, advanced slowly down the pavement.</p><p>The whole town, as he went, showed itself empty and deserted, as though a great wind had blown everything alive out of it. The doors and windows of the houses stood open to the night; nothing stirred; moonlight and silence lay over all. The night lay about him like a cloak. The air, soft and cool, caressed his cheek like the touch of a great furry paw. He gained confidence and began to walk quickly, though still keeping to the shadowed side. Nowhere could he discover the faintest sign of the great unholy exodus he knew had just taken place. The moon sailed high over all in a sky cloudless and serene.</p><p>Hardly realising where he was going, he crossed the open market-place and so came to the ramparts, whence he knew a pathway descended to the high road and along which he could make good his escape to one of the other little towns that lay to the northward, and so to the railway.</p><p>But first he paused and gazed out over the scene at his feet where the great plain lay like a silver map of some dream country. The still beauty of it entered his heart, increasing his sense of bewilderment and unreality. No air stirred, the leaves of the plane trees stood motionless, the near details were defined with the sharpness of day against dark shadows, and in the distance the fields and woods melted away into haze and shimmering mistiness.</p><p>But the breath caught in his throat and he stood stockstill as though transfixed when his gaze passed from the horizon and fell upon the near prospect in the depth of the valley at his feet. The whole lower slopes of the hill, that lay hid from the brightness of the moon, were aglow, and through the glare he saw countless moving forms, shifting thick and fast between the openings of the trees; while overhead, like leaves driven by the wind, he discerned flying shapes that hovered darkly one moment against the sky and then settled down with cries and weird singing through the branches into the region that was aflame.</p><p>Spellbound, he stood and stared for a time that he could not measure. And then, moved by one of the terrible impulses that seemed to control the whole adventure, he climbed swiftly upon the top of the broad coping, and balanced a moment where the valley gaped at his feet. But in that very instant, as he stood hovering, a sudden movement among the shadows of the houses caught his eye, and he turned to see the outline of a large animal dart swiftly across the open space behind him, and land with a flying leap upon the top of the wall a little lower down. It ran like the wind to his feet and then rose up beside him upon the ramparts. A shiver seemed to run through the moonlight, and his sight trembled for a second. His heart pulsed fearfully. Ilse stood beside him, peering into his face.</p><p>Some dark substance, he saw, stained the girl&#39;s face and skin, shining in the moonlight as she stretched her hands towards him; she was dressed in wretched tattered garments that yet became her mightily; rue and vervain twined about her temples; her eyes glittered with unholy light. He only just controlled the wild impulse to take her in his arms and leap with her from their giddy perch into the valley below.</p><p>&quot;See!&quot; she cried, pointing with an arm on which the rags fluttered in the rising wind towards the forest aglow in the distance. &quot;See where they await us! The woods are alive! Already the Great Ones are there, and the dance will soon begin! The salve is here! Anoint yourself and come!&quot;</p><p>Though a moment before the sky was clear and cloudless, yet even while she spoke the face of the moon grew dark and the wind began to toss in the crests of the plane trees at his feet. Stray gusts brought the sounds of hoarse singing and crying from the lower slopes of the hill, and the pungent odour he had already noticed about the courtyard of the inn rose about him in the air.</p><p>&quot;Transform, transform!&quot; she cried again, her voice rising like a song. &quot;Rub well your skin before you fly. Come! Come with me to the Sabbath, to the madness of its furious delight, to the sweet abandonment of its evil worship! See! the Great Ones are there, and the terrible Sacraments prepared. The Throne is occupied. Anoint and come! Anoint and come!&quot;</p><p>She grew to the height of a tree beside him, leaping upon the wall with flaming eyes and hair strewn upon the night. He too began to change swiftly. Her hands touched the skin of his face and neck, streaking him with the burning salve that sent the old magic into his blood with the power before which fades all that is good.</p><p>A wild roar came up to his ears from the heart of the wood, and the girl, when she heard it, leaped upon the wall in the frenzy of her wicked joy.</p><p>&quot;Satan is there!&quot; she screamed, rushing upon him and striving to draw him with her to the edge of the wall. &quot;Satan has come. The Sacraments call us! Come, with your dear apostate soul, and we will worship and dance till the moon dies and the world is forgotten!&quot;</p><p>Just saving himself from the dreadful plunge, Vezin struggled to release himself from her grasp, while the passion tore at his reins and all but mastered him. He shrieked aloud, not knowing what he said, and then he shrieked again. It was the old impulses, the old awful habits instinctively finding voice; for though it seemed to him that he merely shrieked nonsense, the words he uttered really had meaning in them, and were intelligible. It was the ancient call. And it was heard below. It was answered.</p><p>The wind whistled at the skirts of his coat as the air round him darkened with many flying forms crowding upwards out of the valley. The crying of hoarse voices smote upon his ears, coming closer. Strokes of wind buffeted him, tearing him this way and that along the crumbling top of the stone wall; and Ilse clung to him with her long shining arms, smooth and bare, holding him fast about the neck. But not Ilse alone, for a dozen of them surrounded him, dropping out of the air. The pungent odour of the anointed bodies stifled him, exciting him to the old madness of the Sabbath, the dance of the witches and sorcerers doing honour to the personified Evil of the world.</p><p>&quot;Anoint and away! Anoint and away!&quot; they cried in wild chorus about him. &quot;To the Dance that never dies! To the sweet and fearful fantasy of evil!&quot;</p><p>Another moment and he would have yielded and gone, for his will turned soft and the flood of passionate memory all but overwhelmed him, when--so can a small thing after the whole course of an adventure--he caught his foot upon a loose stone in the edge of the wall, and then fell with a sudden crash on to the ground below. But he fell towards the houses, in the open space of dust and cobblestones, and fortunately not into the gaping depth of the valley on the farther side.</p><p>And they, too, came in a tumbling heap about him, like flies upon a piece of food, but as they fell he was released for a moment from the power of their touch, and in that brief instant of freedom there flashed into his mind the sudden intuition that saved him. Before he could regain his feet he saw them scrabbling awkwardly back upon the wall, as though bat-like they could only fly by dropping from a height, and had no hold upon him in the open. Then, seeing them perched there in a row like cats upon a roof, all dark and singularly shapeless, their eyes like lamps, the sudden memory came back to him of Ilse&#39;s terror at the sight of fire.</p><p>Quick as a flash he found his matches and lit the dead leaves that lay under the wall.</p><p>Dry and withered, they caught fire at once, and the wind carried the flame in a long line down the length of the wall, licking upwards as it ran; and with shrieks and wailings, the crowded row of forms upon the top melted away into the air on the other side, and were gone with a great rush and whirring of their bodies down into the heart of the haunted valley, leaving Vezin breathless and shaken in the middle of the deserted ground.</p><p>&quot;Ilse!&quot; he called feebly; &quot;Ilse!&quot; for his heart ached to think that she was really gone to the great Dance without him, and that he had lost the opportunity of its fearful joy. Yet at the same time his relief was so great, and he was so dazed and troubled in mind with the whole thing, that he hardly knew what he was saying, and only cried aloud in the fierce storm of his emotion....</p><p>The fire under the wall ran its course, and the moonlight came out again, soft and clear, from its temporary eclipse. With one last shuddering look at the ruined ramparts, and a feeling of horrid wonder for the haunted valley beyond, where the shapes still crowded and flew, he turned his face towards the town and slowly made his way in the direction of the hotel.</p><p>And as he went, a great wailing of cries, and a sound of howling, followed him from the gleaming forest below, growing fainter and fainter with the bursts of wind as he disappeared between the houses.</p><p>VI</p><p>&quot;It may seem rather abrupt to you, this sudden tame ending,&quot; said Arthur Vezin, glancing with flushed face and timid eyes at Dr. Silence sitting there with his notebook, &quot;but the fact is--er--from that moment my memory seems to have failed rather. I have no distinct recollection of how I got home or what precisely I did.</p><p>&quot;It appears I never went back to the inn at all. I only dimly recollect racing down a long white road in the moonlight, past woods and villages, still and deserted, and then the dawn came up, and I saw the towers of a biggish town and so came to a station.</p><p>&quot;But, long before that, I remember pausing somewhere on the road and looking back to where the hill-town of my adventure stood up in the moonlight, and thinking how exactly like a great monstrous cat it lay there upon the plain, its huge front paws lying down the two main streets, and the twin and broken towers of the cathedral marking its torn ears against the sky. That picture stays in my mind with the utmost vividness to this day.</p><p>&quot;Another thing remains in my mind from that escape--namely, the sudden sharp reminder that I had not paid my bill, and the decision I made, standing there on the dusty highroad, that the small baggage I had left behind would more than settle for my indebtedness.</p><p>&quot;For the rest, I can only tell you that I got coffee and bread at a cafe on the outskirts of this town I had come to, and soon after found my way to the station and caught a train later in the day. That same evening I reached London.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And how long altogether,&quot; asked John Silence quietly, &quot;do you think you stayed in the town of the adventure?&quot;</p><p>Vezin looked up sheepishly.</p><p>&quot;I was coming to that,&quot; he resumed, with apologetic wrigglings of his body. &quot;In London I found that I was a whole week out in my reckoning of time. I had stayed over a week in the town, and it ought to have been September 15th,--instead of which it was only September 10th!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So that, in reality, you had only stayed a night or two in the inn?&quot; queried the doctor.</p><p>Vezin hesitated before replying. He shuffled upon the mat.</p><p>&quot;I must have gained time somewhere,&quot; he said at length--&quot;somewhere or somehow. I certainly had a week to my credit. I can&#39;t explain it. I can only give you the fact.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And this happened to you last year, since when you have never been back to the place?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Last autumn, yes,&quot; murmured Vezin; &quot;and I have never dared to go back. I think I never want to.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And, tell me,&quot; asked Dr. Silence at length, when he saw that the little man had evidently come to the end of his words and had nothing more to say, &quot;had you ever read up the subject of the old witchcraft practices during the Middle Ages, or been at all interested in the subject?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never!&quot; declared Vezin emphatically. &quot;I had never given a thought to such matters so far as I know--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or to the question of reincarnation, perhaps?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never--before my adventure; but I have since,&quot; he replied significantly.</p><p>There was, however, something still on the man&#39;s mind that he wished to relieve himself of by confession, yet could only with difficulty bring himself to mention; and it was only after the sympathetic tactfulness of the doctor had provided numerous openings that he at length availed himself of one of them, and stammered that he would like to show him the marks he still had on his neck where, he said, the girl had touched him with her anointed hands.</p><p>He took off his collar after infinite fumbling hesitation, and lowered his shirt a little for the doctor to see. And there, on the surface of the skin, lay a faint reddish line across the shoulder and extending a little way down the back towards the spine. It certainly indicated exactly the position an arm might have taken in the act of embracing. And on the other side of the neck, slightly higher up, was a similar mark, though not quite so clearly defined.</p><p>&quot;That was where she held me that night on the ramparts,&quot; he whispered, a strange light coming and going in his eyes.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>It was some weeks later when I again found occasion to consult John Silence concerning another extraordinary case that had come under my notice, and we fell to discussing Vezin&#39;s story. Since hearing it, the doctor had made investigations on his own account, and one of his secretaries had discovered that Vezin&#39;s ancestors had actually lived for generations in the very town where the adventure came to him. Two of them, both women, had been tried and convicted as witches, and had been burned alive at the stake. Moreover, it had not been difficult to prove that the very inn where Vezin stayed was built about 1700 upon the spot where the funeral pyres stood and the executions took place. The town was a sort of headquarters for all the sorcerers and witches of the entire region, and after conviction they were burnt there literally by scores.</p><p>&quot;It seems strange,&quot; continued the doctor, &quot;that Vezin should have remained ignorant of all this; but, on the other hand, it was not the kind of history that successive generations would have been anxious to keep alive, or to repeat to their children. Therefore I am inclined to think he still knows nothing about it.</p><p>&quot;The whole adventure seems to have been a very vivid revival of the memories of an earlier life, caused by coming directly into contact with the living forces still intense enough to hang about the place, and, by a most singular chance, too, with the very souls who had taken part with him in the events of that particular life. For the mother and daughter who impressed him so strangely must have been leading actors, with himself, in the scenes and practices of witchcraft which at that period dominated the imaginations of the whole country.</p><p>&quot;One has only to read the histories of the times to know that these witches claimed the power of transforming themselves into various animals, both for the purposes of disguise and also to convey themselves swiftly to the scenes of their imaginary orgies. Lycanthropy, or the power to change themselves into wolves, was everywhere believed in, and the ability to transform themselves into cats by rubbing their bodies with a special salve or ointment provided by Satan himself, found equal credence. The witchcraft trials abound in evidences of such universal beliefs.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence quoted chapter and verse from many writers on the subject, and showed how every detail of Vezin&#39;s adventure had a basis in the practices of those dark days.</p><p>&quot;But that the entire affair took place subjectively in the man&#39;s own consciousness, I have no doubt,&quot; he went on, in reply to my questions; &quot;for my secretary who has been to the town to investigate, discovered his signature in the visitors&#39; book, and proved by it that he had arrived on September 8th, and left suddenly without paying his bill. He left two days later, and they still were in possession of his dirty brown bag and some tourist clothes. I paid a few francs in settlement of his debt, and have sent his luggage on to him. The daughter was absent from home, but the proprietress, a large woman very much as he described her, told my secretary that he had seemed a very strange, absent-minded kind of gentleman, and after his disappearance she had feared for a long time that he had met with a violent end in the neighbouring forest where he used to roam about alone.</p><p>&quot;I should like to have obtained a personal interview with the daughter so as to ascertain how much was subjective and how much actually took place with her as Vezin told it. For her dread of fire and the sight of burning must, of course, have been the intuitive memory of her former painful death at the stake, and have thus explained why he fancied more than once that he saw her through smoke and flame.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And that mark on his skin, for instance?&quot; I inquired.</p><p>&quot;Merely the marks produced by hysterical brooding,&quot; he replied, &quot;like the stigmata of the <em>religieuses</em>, and the bruises which appear on the bodies of hypnotised subjects who have been told to expect them. This is very common and easily explained. Only it seems curious that these marks should have remained so long in Vezin&#39;s case. Usually they disappear quickly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Obviously he is still thinking about it all, brooding, and living it all over again,&quot; I ventured.</p><p>&quot;Probably. And this makes me fear that the end of his trouble is not yet. We shall hear of him again. It is a case, alas! I can do little to alleviate.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence spoke gravely and with sadness in his voice.</p><p>&quot;And what do you make of the Frenchman in the train?&quot; I asked further--&quot;the man who warned him against the place, <em>a cause du sommeil et a cause des chats?</em> Surely a very singular incident?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A very singular incident indeed,&quot; he made answer slowly, &quot;and one I can only explain on the basis of a highly improbable coincidence--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Namely?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That the man was one who had himself stayed in the town and undergone there a similar experience. I should like to find this man and ask him. But the crystal is useless here, for I have no slightest clue to go upon, and I can only conclude that some singular psychic affinity, some force still active in his being out of the same past life, drew him thus to the personality of Vezin, and enabled him to fear what might happen to him, and thus to warn him as he did.</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he presently continued, half talking to himself, &quot;I suspect in this case that Vezin was swept into the vortex of forces arising out of the intense activities of a past life, and that he lived over again a scene in which he had often played a leading part centuries before. For strong actions set up forces that are so slow to exhaust themselves, they may be said in a sense never to die. In this case they were not vital enough to render the illusion complete, so that the little man found himself caught in a very distressing confusion of the present and the past; yet he was sufficiently sensitive to recognise that it was true, and to fight against the degradation of returning, even in memory, to a former and lower state of development.</p><p>&quot;Ah yes!&quot; he continued, crossing the floor to gaze at the darkening sky, and seemingly quite oblivious of my presence, &quot;subliminal up-rushes of memory like this can be exceedingly painful, and sometimes exceedingly dangerous. I only trust that this gentle soul may soon escape from this obsession of a passionate and tempestuous past. But I doubt it, I doubt it.&quot;</p><p>His voice was hushed with sadness as he spoke, and when he turned back into the room again there was an expression of profound yearning upon his face, the yearning of a soul whose desire to help is sometimes greater than his power.</p><p>CASE III: THE NEMESIS OF FIRE</p><p>I</p><p>By some means which I never could fathom, John Silence always contrived to keep the compartment to himself, and as the train had a clear run of two hours before the first stop, there was ample time to go over the preliminary facts of the case. He had telephoned to me that very morning, and even through the disguise of the miles of wire the thrill of incalculable adventure had sounded in his voice.</p><p>&quot;As if it were an ordinary country visit,&quot; he called, in reply to my question; &quot;and don&#39;t forgot to bring your gun.&quot;</p><p>&quot;With blank cartridges, I suppose?&quot; for I knew his rigid principles with regard to the taking of life, and guessed that the guns were merely for some obvious purpose of disguise.</p><p>Then he thanked me for coming, mentioned the train, snapped down the receiver, and left me, vibrating with the excitement of anticipation, to do my packing. For the honour of accompanying Dr. John Silence on one of his big cases was what many would have considered an empty honour--and risky. Certainly the adventure held all manner of possibilities, and I arrived at Waterloo with the feelings of a man who is about to embark on some dangerous and peculiar mission in which the dangers he expects to run will not be the ordinary dangers to life and limb, but of some secret character difficult to name and still more difficult to cope with.</p><p>&quot;The Manor House has a high sound,&quot; he told me, as we sat with our feet up and talked, &quot;but I believe it is little more than an overgrown farmhouse in the desolate heather country beyond D----, and its owner, Colonel Wragge, a retired soldier with a taste for books, lives there practically alone, I understand, with an elderly invalid sister. So you need not look forward to a lively visit, unless the case provides some excitement of its own.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which is likely?&quot;</p><p>By way of reply he handed me a letter marked &quot;Private.&quot; It was dated a week ago, and signed &quot;Yours faithfully, Horace Wragge.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He heard of me, you see, through Captain Anderson,&quot; the doctor explained modestly, as though his fame were not almost world-wide; &quot;you remember that Indian obsession case--&quot;</p><p>I read the letter. Why it should have been marked private was difficult to understand. It was very brief, direct, and to the point. It referred by way of introduction to Captain Anderson, and then stated quite simply that the writer needed help of a peculiar kind and asked for a personal interview--a morning interview, since it was impossible for him to be absent from the house at night. The letter was dignified even to the point of abruptness, and it is difficult to explain how it managed to convey to me the impression of a strong man, shaken and perplexed. Perhaps the restraint of the wording, and the mystery of the affair had something to do with it; and the reference to the Anderson case, the horror of which lay still vivid in my memory, may have touched the sense of something rather ominous and alarming. But, whatever the cause, there was no doubt that an impression of serious peril rose somehow out of that white paper with the few lines of firm writing, and the spirit of a deep uneasiness ran between the words and reached the mind without any visible form of expression.</p><p>&quot;And when you saw him--?&quot; I asked, returning the letter as the train rushed clattering noisily through Clapham Junction.</p><p>&quot;I have not seen him,&quot; was the reply. &quot;The man&#39;s mind was charged to the brim when he wrote that; full of vivid mental pictures. Notice the restraint of it. For the main character of his case psychometry could be depended upon, and the scrap of paper his hand has touched is sufficient to give to another mind--a sensitive and sympathetic mind--clear mental pictures of what is going on. I think I have a very sound general idea of his problem.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So there may be excitement, after all?&quot;</p><p>John Silence waited a moment before he replied.</p><p>&quot;Something very serious is amiss there,&quot; he said gravely, at length. &quot;Some one--not himself, I gather,--has been meddling with a rather dangerous kind of gunpowder. So--yes, there may be excitement, as you put it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And my duties?&quot; I asked, with a decidedly growing interest. &quot;Remember, I am your &#39;assistant.&#39;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Behave like an intelligent confidential secretary. Observe everything, without seeming to. Say nothing--nothing that means anything. Be present at all interviews. I may ask a good deal of you, for if my impressions are correct this is--&quot;</p><p>He broke off suddenly.</p><p>&quot;But I won&#39;t tell you my impressions yet,&quot; he resumed after a moment&#39;s thought. &quot;Just watch and listen as the case proceeds. Form your own impressions and cultivate your intuitions. We come as ordinary visitors, of course,&quot; he added, a twinkle showing for an instant in his eye; &quot;hence, the guns.&quot;</p><p>Though disappointed not to hear more, I recognised the wisdom of his words and knew how valueless my impressions would be once the powerful suggestion of having heard his own lay behind them. I likewise reflected that intuition joined to a sense of humour was of more use to a man than double the quantity of mere &quot;brains,&quot; as such.</p><p>Before putting the letter away, however, he handed it back, telling me to place it against my forehead for a few moments and then describe any pictures that came spontaneously into my mind.</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t deliberately look for anything. Just imagine you see the inside of the eyelid, and wait for pictures that rise against its dark screen.&quot;</p><p>I followed his instructions, making my mind as nearly blank as possible. But no visions came. I saw nothing but the lines of light that pass to and fro like the changes of a kaleidoscope across the blackness. A momentary sensation of warmth came and went curiously.</p><p>&quot;You see--what?&quot; he asked presently.</p><p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; I was obliged to admit disappointedly; &quot;nothing but the usual flashes of light one always sees. Only, perhaps, they are more vivid than usual.&quot;</p><p>He said nothing by way of comment or reply.</p><p>&quot;And they group themselves now and then,&quot; I continued, with painful candour, for I longed to see the pictures he had spoken of, &quot;group themselves into globes and round balls of fire, and the lines that flash about sometimes look like triangles and crosses--almost like geometrical figures. Nothing more.&quot;</p><p>I opened my eyes again, and gave him back the letter.</p><p>&quot;It makes my head hot,&quot; I said, feeling somehow unworthy for not seeing anything of interest. But the look in his eyes arrested my attention at once.</p><p>&quot;That sensation of heat is important,&quot; he said significantly.</p><p>&quot;It was certainly real, and rather uncomfortable,&quot; I replied, hoping he would expand and explain. &quot;There was a distinct feeling of warmth--internal warmth somewhere--oppressive in a sense.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is interesting,&quot; he remarked, putting the letter back in his pocket, and settling himself in the corner with newspapers and books. He vouchsafed nothing more, and I knew the uselessness of trying to make him talk. Following his example I settled likewise with magazines into my corner. But when I closed my eyes again to look for the flashing lights and the sensation of heat, I found nothing but the usual phantasmagoria of the day&#39;s events--faces, scenes, memories,--and in due course I fell asleep and then saw nothing at all of any kind.</p><p>When we left the train, after six hours&#39; travelling, at a little wayside station standing without trees in a world of sand and heather, the late October shadows had already dropped their sombre veil upon the landscape, and the sun dipped almost out of sight behind the moorland hills. In a high dogcart, behind a fast horse, we were soon rattling across the undulating stretches of an open and bleak country, the keen air stinging our cheeks and the scents of pine and bracken strong about us. Bare hills were faintly visible against the horizon, and the coachman pointed to a bank of distant shadows on our left where he told us the sea lay. Occasional stone farmhouses, standing back from the road among straggling fir trees, and large black barns that seemed to shift past us with a movement of their own in the gloom, were the only signs of humanity and civilisation that we saw, until at the end of a bracing five miles the lights of the lodge gates flared before us and we plunged into a thick grove of pine trees that concealed the Manor House up to the moment of actual arrival.</p><p>Colonel Wragge himself met us in the hall. He was the typical army officer who had seen service, real service, and found himself in the process. He was tall and well built, broad in the shoulders, but lean as a greyhound, with grave eyes, rather stern, and a moustache turning grey. I judged him to be about sixty years of age, but his movements showed a suppleness of strength and agility that contradicted the years. The face was full of character and resolution, the face of a man to be depended upon, and the straight grey eyes, it seemed to me, wore a veil of perplexed anxiety that he made no attempt to disguise. The whole appearance of the man at once clothed the adventure with gravity and importance. A matter that gave such a man cause for serious alarm, I felt, must be something real and of genuine moment.</p><p>His speech and manner, as he welcomed us, were like his letter, simple and sincere. He had a nature as direct and undeviating as a bullet. Thus, he showed plainly his surprise that Dr. Silence had not come alone.</p><p>&quot;My confidential secretary, Mr. Hubbard,&quot; the doctor said, introducing me, and the steady gaze and powerful shake of the hand I then received were well calculated, I remember thinking, to drive home the impression that here was a man who was not to be trifled with, and whose perplexity must spring from some very real and tangible cause. And, quite obviously, he was relieved that we had come. His welcome was unmistakably genuine.</p><p>He led us at once into a room, half library, half smoking-room, that opened out of the low-ceilinged hall. The Manor House gave the impression of a rambling and glorified farmhouse, solid, ancient, comfortable, and wholly unpretentious. And so it was. Only the heat of the place struck me as unnatural. This room with the blazing fire may have seemed uncomfortably warm after the long drive through the night air; yet it seemed to me that the hall itself, and the whole atmosphere of the house, breathed a warmth that hardly belonged to well-filled grates or the pipes of hot air and water. It was not the heat of the greenhouse; it was an oppressive heat that somehow got into the head and mind. It stirred a curious sense of uneasiness in me, and I caught myself thinking of the sensation of warmth that had emanated from the letter in the train.</p><p>I heard him thanking Dr. Silence for having come; there was no preamble, and the exchange of civilities was of the briefest description. Evidently here was a man who, like my companion, loved action rather than talk. His manner was straightforward and direct. I saw him in a flash: puzzled, worried, harassed into a state of alarm by something he could not comprehend; forced to deal with things he would have preferred to despise, yet facing it all with dogged seriousness and making no attempt to conceal that he felt secretly ashamed of his incompetence.</p><p>&quot;So I cannot offer you much entertainment beyond that of my own company, and the queer business that has been going on here, and is still going on,&quot; he said, with a slight inclination of the head towards me by way of including me in his confidence.</p><p>&quot;I think, Colonel Wragge,&quot; replied John Silence impressively, &quot;that we shall none of us find the time hangs heavy. I gather we shall have our hands full.&quot;</p><p>The two men looked at one another for the space of some seconds, and there was an indefinable quality in their silence which for the first time made me admit a swift question into my mind; and I wondered a little at my rashness in coming with so little reflection into a big case of this incalculable doctor. But no answer suggested itself, and to withdraw was, of course, inconceivable. The gates had closed behind me now, and the spirit of the adventure was already besieging my mind with its advance guard of a thousand little hopes and fears.</p><p>Explaining that he would wait till after dinner to discuss anything serious, as no reference was ever made before his sister, he led the way upstairs and showed us personally to our rooms; and it was just as I was finishing dressing that a knock came at my door and Dr. Silence entered.</p><p>He was always what is called a serious man, so that even in moments of comedy you felt he never lost sight of the profound gravity of life, but as he came across the room to me I caught the expression of his face and understood in a flash that he was now in his most grave and earnest mood. He looked almost troubled. I stopped fumbling with my black tie and stared.</p><p>&quot;It is serious,&quot; he said, speaking in a low voice, &quot;more so even than I imagined. Colonel Wragge&#39;s control over his thoughts concealed a great deal in my psychometrising of the letter. I looked in to warn you to keep yourself well in hand--generally speaking.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Haunted house?&quot; I asked, conscious of a distinct shiver down my back.</p><p>But he smiled gravely at the question.</p><p>&quot;Haunted House of Life more likely,&quot; he replied, and a look came into his eyes which I had only seen there when a human soul was in the toils and he was thick in the fight of rescue. He was stirred in the deeps.</p><p>&quot;Colonel Wragge--or the sister?&quot; I asked hurriedly, for the gong was sounding.</p><p>&quot;Neither directly,&quot; he said from the door. &quot;Something far older, something very, very remote indeed. This thing has to do with the ages, unless I am mistaken greatly, the ages on which the mists of memory have long lain undisturbed.&quot;</p><p>He came across the floor very quickly with a finger on his lips, looking at me with a peculiar searchingness of gaze.</p><p>&quot;Are you aware yet of anything--odd here?&quot; he asked in a whisper. &quot;Anything you cannot quite define, for instance. Tell me, Hubbard, for I want to know all your impressions. They may help me.&quot;</p><p>I shook my head, avoiding his gaze, for there was something in the eyes that scared me a little. But he was so in earnest that I set my mind keenly searching.</p><p>&quot;Nothing yet,&quot; I replied truthfully, wishing I could confess to a real emotion; &quot;nothing but the strange heat of the place.&quot;</p><p>He gave a little jump forward in my direction.</p><p>&quot;The heat again, that&#39;s it!&quot; he exclaimed, as though glad of my corroboration. &quot;And how would you describe it, perhaps?&quot; he asked quickly, with a hand on the door knob.</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t seem like ordinary physical heat,&quot; I said, casting about in my thoughts for a definition.</p><p>&quot;More a mental heat,&quot; he interrupted, &quot;a glowing of thought and desire, a sort of feverish warmth of the spirit. Isn&#39;t that it?&quot;</p><p>I admitted that he had exactly described my sensations.</p><p>&quot;Good!&quot; he said, as he opened the door, and with an indescribable gesture that combined a warning to be ready with a sign of praise for my correct intuition, he was gone.</p><p>I hurried after him, and found the two men waiting for me in front of the fire.</p><p>&quot;I ought to warn you,&quot; our host was saying as I came in, &quot;that my sister, whom you will meet at dinner, is not aware of the real object of your visit. She is under the impression that we are interested in the same line of study--folklore--and that your researches have led to my seeking acquaintance. She comes to dinner in her chair, you know. It will be a great pleasure to her to meet you both. We have few visitors.&quot;</p><p>So that on entering the dining-room we were prepared to find Miss Wragge already at her place, seated in a sort of bath-chair. She was a vivacious and charming old lady, with smiling expression and bright eyes, and she chatted all through dinner with unfailing spontaneity. She had that face, unlined and fresh, that some people carry through life from the cradle to the grave; her smooth plump cheeks were all pink and white, and her hair, still dark, was divided into two glossy and sleek halves on either side of a careful parting. She wore gold-rimmed glasses, and at her throat was a large scarab of green jasper that made a very handsome brooch.</p><p>Her brother and Dr. Silence talked little, so that most of the conversation was carried on between herself and me, and she told me a great deal about the history of the old house, most of which I fear I listened to with but half an ear.</p><p>&quot;And when Cromwell stayed here,&quot; she babbled on, &quot;he occupied the very rooms upstairs that used to be mine. But my brother thinks it safer for me to sleep on the ground floor now in case of fire.&quot;</p><p>And this sentence has stayed in my memory only because of the sudden way her brother interrupted her and instantly led the conversation on to another topic. The passing reference to fire seemed to have disturbed him, and thenceforward he directed the talk himself.</p><p>It was difficult to believe that this lively and animated old lady, sitting beside me and taking so eager an interest in the affairs of life, was practically, we understood, without the use of her lower limbs, and that her whole existence for years had been passed between the sofa, the bed, and the bath-chair in which she chatted so naturally at the dinner table. She made no allusion to her affliction until the dessert was reached, and then, touching a bell, she made us a witty little speech about leaving us &quot;like time, on noiseless feet,&quot; and was wheeled out of the room by the butler and carried off to her apartments at the other end of the house.</p><p>And the rest of us were not long in following suit, for Dr. Silence and myself were quite as eager to learn the nature of our errand as our host was to impart it to us. He led us down a long flagged passage to a room at the very end of the house, a room provided with double doors, and windows, I saw, heavily shuttered. Books lined the walls on every side, and a large desk in the bow window was piled up with volumes, some open, some shut, some showing scraps of paper stuck between the leaves, and all smothered in a general cataract of untidy foolscap and loose-half sheets.</p><p>&quot;My study and workroom,&quot; explained Colonel Wragge, with a delightful touch of innocent pride, as though he were a very serious scholar. He placed arm-chairs for us round the fire. &quot;Here,&quot; he added significantly, &quot;we shall be safe from interruption and can talk securely.&quot;</p><p>During dinner the manner of the doctor had been all that was natural and spontaneous, though it was impossible for me, knowing him as I did, not to be aware that he was subconsciously very keenly alert and already receiving upon the ultra-sensitive surface of his mind various and vivid impressions; and there was now something in the gravity of his face, as well as in the significant tone of Colonel Wragge&#39;s speech, and something, too, in the fact that we three were shut away in this private chamber about to listen to things probably strange, and certainly mysterious--something in all this that touched my imagination sharply and sent an undeniable thrill along my nerves. Taking the chair indicated by my host, I lit my cigar and waited for the opening of the attack, fully conscious that we were now too far gone in the adventure to admit of withdrawal, and wondering a little anxiously where it was going to lead.</p><p>What I expected precisely, it is hard to say. Nothing definite, perhaps. Only the sudden change was dramatic. A few hours before the prosaic atmosphere of Piccadilly was about me, and now I was sitting in a secret chamber of this remote old building waiting to hear an account of things that held possibly the genuine heart of terror. I thought of the dreary moors and hills outside, and the dark pine copses soughing in the wind of night; I remembered my companion&#39;s singular words up in my bedroom before dinner; and then I turned and noted carefully the stern countenance of the Colonel as he faced us and lit his big black cigar before speaking.</p><p>The threshold of an adventure, I reflected as I waited for the first words, is always the most thrilling moment--until the climax comes.</p><p>But Colonel Wragge hesitated--mentally--a long time before he began. He talked briefly of our journey, the weather, the country, and other comparatively trivial topics, while he sought about in his mind for an appropriate entry into the subject that was uppermost in the thoughts of all of us. The fact was he found it a difficult matter to speak of at all, and it was Dr. Silence who finally showed him the way over the hedge.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Hubbard will take a few notes when you are ready--you won&#39;t object,&quot; he suggested; &quot;I can give my undivided attention in this way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By all means,&quot; turning to reach some of the loose sheets on the writing table, and glancing at me. He still hesitated a little, I thought. &quot;The fact is,&quot; he said apologetically, &quot;I wondered if it was quite fair to trouble you so soon. The daylight might suit you better to hear what I have to tell. Your sleep, I mean, might be less disturbed, perhaps.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I appreciate your thoughtfulness,&quot; John Silence replied with his gentle smile, taking command as it were from that moment, &quot;but really we are both quite immune. There is nothing, I think, that could prevent either of us sleeping, except--an outbreak of fire, or some such very physical disturbance.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge raised his eyes and looked fixedly at him. This reference to an outbreak of fire I felt sure was made with a purpose. It certainly had the desired effect of removing from our host&#39;s manner the last signs of hesitancy.</p><p>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course, I know nothing of your methods in matters of this kind--so, perhaps, you would like me to begin at once and give you an outline of the situation?&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence bowed his agreement. &quot;I can then take my precautions accordingly,&quot; he added calmly.</p><p>The soldier looked up for a moment as though he did not quite gather the meaning of these words; but he made no further comment and turned at once to tackle a subject on which he evidently talked with diffidence and unwillingness.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s all so utterly out of my line of things,&quot; he began, puffing out clouds of cigar smoke between his words, &quot;and there&#39;s so little to tell with any real evidence behind it, that it&#39;s almost impossible to make a consecutive story for you. It&#39;s the total cumulative effect that is so--so disquieting.&quot; He chose his words with care, as though determined not to travel one hair&#39;s breadth beyond the truth.</p><p>&quot;I came into this place twenty years ago when my elder brother died,&quot; he continued, &quot;but could not afford to live here then. My sister, whom you met at dinner, kept house for him till the end, and during all these years, while I was seeing service abroad, she had an eye to the place--for we never got a satisfactory tenant--and saw that it was not allowed to go to ruin. I myself took possession, however, only a year ago.</p><p>&quot;My brother,&quot; he went on, after a perceptible pause, &quot;spent much of his time away, too. He was a great traveller, and filled the house with stuff he brought home from all over the world. The laundry--a small detached building beyond the servants&#39; quarters--he turned into a regular little museum. The curios and things I have cleared away--they collected dust and were always getting broken--but the laundry-house you shall see tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge spoke with such deliberation and with so many pauses that this beginning took him a long time. But at this point he came to a full stop altogether. Evidently there was something he wished to say that cost him considerable effort. At length he looked up steadily into my companion&#39;s face.</p><p>&quot;May I ask you--that is, if you won&#39;t think it strange,&quot; he said, and a sort of hush came over his voice and manner, &quot;whether you have noticed anything at all unusual--anything queer, since you came into the house?&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence answered without a moment&#39;s hesitation.</p><p>&quot;I have,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a curious sensation of heat in the place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed the other, with a slight start. &quot;You <em>have</em> noticed it. This unaccountable heat--&quot;</p><p>&quot;But its cause, I gather, is not in the house itself--but outside,&quot; I was astonished to hear the doctor add.</p><p>Colonel Wragge rose from his chair and turned to unhook a framed map that hung upon the wall. I got the impression that the movement was made with the deliberate purpose of concealing his face.</p><p>&quot;Your diagnosis, I believe, is amazingly accurate,&quot; he said after a moment, turning round with the map in his hands. &quot;Though, of course, I can have no idea how you should guess--&quot;</p><p>John Silence shrugged his shoulders expressively. &quot;Merely my impression,&quot; he said. &quot;If you pay attention to impressions, and do not allow them to be confused by deductions of the intellect, you will often find them surprisingly, uncannily, accurate.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge resumed his seat and laid the map upon his knees. His face was very thoughtful as he plunged abruptly again into his story.</p><p>&quot;On coming into possession,&quot; he said, looking us alternately in the face, &quot;I found a crop of stories of the most extraordinary and impossible kind I had ever heard--stories which at first I treated with amused indifference, but later was forced to regard seriously, if only to keep my servants. These stories I thought I traced to the fact of my brother&#39;s death--and, in a way, I think so still.&quot;</p><p>He leant forward and handed the map to Dr. Silence.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s an old plan of the estate,&quot; he explained, &quot;but accurate enough for our purpose, and I wish you would note the position of the plantations marked upon it, especially those near the house. That one,&quot; indicating the spot with his finger, &quot;is called the Twelve Acre Plantation. It was just there, on the side nearest the house, that my brother and the head keeper met their deaths.&quot;</p><p>He spoke as a man forced to recognise facts that he deplored, and would have preferred to leave untouched--things he personally would rather have treated with ridicule if possible. It made his words peculiarly dignified and impressive, and I listened with an increasing uneasiness as to the sort of help the doctor would look to me for later. It seemed as though I were a spectator of some drama of mystery in which any moment I might be summoned to play a part.</p><p>&quot;It was twenty years ago,&quot; continued the Colonel, &quot;but there was much talk about it at the time, unfortunately, and you may, perhaps, have heard of the affair. Stride, the keeper, was a passionate, hot-tempered man but I regret to say, so was my brother, and quarrels between them seem to have been frequent.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not recall the affair,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;May I ask what was the cause of death?&quot; Something in his voice made me prick up my ears for the reply.</p><p>&quot;The keeper, it was said, from suffocation. And at the inquest the doctors averred that both men had been dead the same length of time when found.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And your brother?&quot; asked John Silence, noticing the omission, and listening intently.</p><p>&quot;Equally mysterious,&quot; said our host, speaking in a low voice with effort. &quot;But there was one distressing feature I think I ought to mention. For those who saw the face--I did not see it myself--and though Stride carried a gun its chambers were undischarged--&quot; He stammered and hesitated with confusion. Again that sense of terror moved between his words. He stuck.</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the chief listener sympathetically.</p><p>&quot;My brother&#39;s face, they said, looked as though it had been scorched. It had been swept, as it were, by something that burned--blasted. It was, I am told, quite dreadful. The bodies were found lying side by side, faces downwards, both pointing away from the wood, as though they had been in the act of running, and not more than a dozen yards from its edge.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence made no comment. He appeared to be studying the map attentively.</p><p>&quot;I did not see the face myself,&quot; repeated the other, his manner somehow expressing the sense of awe he contrived to keep out of his voice, &quot;but my sister unfortunately did, and her present state I believe to be entirely due to the shock it gave to her nerves. She never can be brought to refer to it, naturally, and I am even inclined to think that the memory has mercifully been permitted to vanish from her mind. But she spoke of it at the time as a face swept by flame--blasted.&quot;</p><p>John Silence looked up from his contemplation of the map, but with the air of one who wished to listen, not to speak, and presently Colonel Wragge went on with his account. He stood on the mat, his broad shoulders hiding most of the mantelpiece.</p><p>&quot;They all centred about this particular plantation, these stories. That was to be expected, for the people here are as superstitious as Irish peasantry, and though I made one or two examples among them to stop the foolish talk, it had no effect, and new versions came to my ears every week. You may imagine how little good dismissals did, when I tell you that the servants dismissed themselves. It was not the house servants, but the men who worked on the estate outside. The keepers gave notice one after another, none of them with any reason I could accept; the foresters refused to enter the wood, and the beaters to beat in it. Word flew all over the countryside that Twelve Acre Plantation was a place to be avoided, day or night.</p><p>&quot;There came a point,&quot; the Colonel went on, now well in his swing, &quot;when I felt compelled to make investigations on my own account. I could not kill the thing by ignoring it; so I collected and analysed the stories at first hand. For this Twelve Acre Wood, you will see by the map, comes rather near home. Its lower end, if you will look, almost touches the end of the back lawn, as I will show you tomorrow, and its dense growth of pines forms the chief protection the house enjoys from the east winds that blow up from the sea. And in olden days, before my brother interfered with it and frightened all the game away, it was one of the best pheasant coverts on the whole estate.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what form, if I may ask, did this interference take?&quot; asked Dr. Silence.</p><p>&quot;In detail, I cannot tell you, for I do not know--except that I understand it was the subject of his frequent differences with the head keeper; but during the last two years of his life, when he gave up travelling and settled down here, he took a special interest in this wood, and for some unaccountable reason began to build a low stone wall around it. This wall was never finished, but you shall see the ruins tomorrow in the daylight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the result of your investigations--these stories, I mean?&quot; the doctor broke in, anxious to keep him to the main issues.</p><p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;m coming to that,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;but the wood first, for this wood out of which they grew like mushrooms has nothing in any way peculiar about it. It is very thickly grown, and rises to a clearer part in the centre, a sort of mound where there is a circle of large boulders--old Druid stones, I&#39;m told. At another place there&#39;s a small pond. There&#39;s nothing distinctive about it that I could mention--just an ordinary pine-wood, a very ordinary pine-wood--only the trees are a bit twisted in the trunks, some of &#39;em, and very dense. Nothing more.</p><p>&quot;And the stories? Well, none of them had anything to do with my poor brother, or the keeper, as you might have expected; and they were all odd--such odd things, I mean, to invent or imagine. I never could make out how these people got such notions into their heads.&quot;</p><p>He paused a moment to relight his cigar.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no regular path through it,&quot; he resumed, puffing vigorously, &quot;but the fields round it are constantly used, and one of the gardeners whose cottage lies over that way declared he often saw moving lights in it at night, and luminous shapes like globes of fire over the tops of the trees, skimming and floating, and making a soft hissing sound--most of &#39;em said that, in fact--and another man saw shapes flitting in and out among the trees, things that were neither men nor animals, and all faintly luminous. No one ever pretended to see human forms--always queer, huge things they could not properly describe. Sometimes the whole wood was lit up, and one fellow--he&#39;s still here and you shall see him--has a most circumstantial yarn about having seen great stars lying on the ground round the edge of the wood at regular intervals--&quot;</p><p>&quot;What kind of stars?&quot; put in John Silence sharply, in a sudden way that made me start.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know quite; ordinary stars, I think he said, only very large, and apparently blazing as though the ground was alight. He was too terrified to go close and examine, and he has never seen them since.&quot;</p><p>He stooped and stirred the fire into a welcome blaze--welcome for its blaze of light rather than for its heat. In the room there was already a strange pervading sensation of warmth that was oppressive in its effect and far from comforting.</p><p>&quot;Of course,&quot; he went on, straightening up again on the mat, &quot;this was all commonplace enough--this seeing lights and figures at night. Most of these fellows drink, and imagination and terror between them may account for almost anything. But others saw things in broad daylight. One of the woodmen, a sober, respectable man, took the shortcut home to his midday meal, and swore he was followed the whole length of the wood by something that never showed itself, but dodged from tree to tree, always keeping out of sight, yet solid enough to make the branches sway and the twigs snap on the ground. And it made a noise, he declared--but really&quot;--the speaker stopped and gave a short laugh--&quot;it&#39;s too absurd--&quot;</p><p>&quot;<em>Please!</em>&quot; insisted the doctor; &quot;for it is these small details that give me the best clues always.&quot;</p><p>&quot;--it made a crackling noise, he said, like a bonfire. Those were his very words: like the crackling of a bonfire,&quot; finished the soldier, with a repetition of his short laugh.</p><p>&quot;Most interesting,&quot; Dr. Silence observed gravely. &quot;Please omit nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he went on, &quot;and it was soon after that the fires began--the fires in the wood. They started mysteriously burning in the patches of coarse white grass that cover the more open parts of the plantation. No one ever actually saw them start, but many, myself among the number, have seen them burning and smouldering. They are always small and circular in shape, and for all the world like a picnic fire. The head keeper has a dozen explanations, from sparks flying out of the house chimneys to the sunlight focusing through a dewdrop, but none of them, I must admit, convince me as being in the least likely or probable. They are most singular, I consider, most singular, these mysterious fires, and I am glad to say that they come only at rather long intervals and never seem to spread.</p><p>&quot;But the keeper had other queer stories as well, and about things that are verifiable. He declared that no life ever willingly entered the plantation; more, that no life existed in it at all. No birds nested in the trees, or flew into their shade. He set countless traps, but never caught so much as a rabbit or a weasel. Animals avoided it, and more than once he had picked up dead creatures round the edges that bore no obvious signs of how they had met their death.</p><p>&quot;Moreover, he told me one extraordinary tale about his retriever chasing some invisible creature across the field one day when he was out with his gun. The dog suddenly pointed at something in the field at his feet, and then gave chase, yelping like a mad thing. It followed its imaginary quarry to the borders of the wood, and then went in--a thing he had never known it to do before. The moment it crossed the edge--it is darkish in there even in daylight--it began fighting in the most frenzied and terrific fashion. It made him afraid to interfere, he said. And at last, when the dog came out, hanging its tail down and panting, he found something like white hair stuck to its jaws, and brought it to show me. I tell you these details because--&quot;</p><p>&quot;They are important, believe me,&quot; the doctor stopped him. &quot;And you have it still, this hair?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;It disappeared in the oddest way,&quot; the Colonel explained. &quot;It was curious looking stuff, something like asbestos, and I sent it to be analysed by the local chemist. But either the man got wind of its origin, or else he didn&#39;t like the look of it for some reason, because he returned it to me and said it was neither animal, vegetable, nor mineral, so far as he could make out, and he didn&#39;t wish to have anything to do with it. I put it away in paper, but a week later, on opening the package--it was gone! Oh, the stories are simply endless. I could tell you hundreds all on the same lines.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And personal experiences of your own, Colonel Wragge?&quot; asked John Silence earnestly, his manner showing the greatest possible interest and sympathy.</p><p>The soldier gave an almost imperceptible start. He looked distinctly uncomfortable.</p><p>&quot;Nothing, I think,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;nothing--er--I should like to rely on. I mean nothing I have the right to speak of, perhaps--yet.&quot;</p><p>His mouth closed with a snap. Dr. Silence, after waiting a little to see if he would add to his reply, did not seek to press him on the point.</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; he resumed presently, and as though he would speak contemptuously, yet dared not, &quot;this sort of thing has gone on at intervals ever since. It spreads like wildfire, of course, mysterious chatter of this kind, and people began trespassing all over the estate, coming to see the wood, and making themselves a general nuisance. Notices of man-traps and spring-guns only seemed to increase their persistence; and--think of it,&quot; he snorted, &quot;some local Research Society actually wrote and asked permission for one of their members to spend a night in the wood! Bolder fools, who didn&#39;t write for leave, came and took away bits of bark from the trees and gave them to clairvoyants, who invented in their turn a further batch of tales. There was simply no end to it all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Most distressing and annoying, I can well believe,&quot; interposed the doctor.</p><p>&quot;Then suddenly, the phenomena ceased as mysteriously as they had begun, and the interest flagged. The tales stopped. People got interested in something else. It all seemed to die out. This was last July. I can tell you exactly, for I&#39;ve kept a diary more or less of what happened.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p><p>&quot;But now, quite recently, within the past three weeks, it has all revived again with a rush--with a kind of furious attack, so to speak. It has really become unbearable. You may imagine what it means, and the general state of affairs, when I say that the possibility of leaving has occurred to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Incendiarism?&quot; suggested Dr. Silence, half under his breath, but not so low that Colonel Wragge did not hear him.</p><p>&quot;By Jove, sir, you take the very words out of my mouth!&quot; exclaimed the astonished man, glancing from the doctor to me and from me to the doctor, and rattling the money in his pocket as though some explanation of my friend&#39;s divining powers were to be found that way.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s only that you are thinking very vividly,&quot; the doctor said quietly, &quot;and your thoughts form pictures in my mind before you utter them. It&#39;s merely a little elementary thought-reading.&quot;</p><p>His intention, I saw, was not to perplex the good man, but to impress him with his powers so as to ensure obedience later.</p><p>&quot;Good Lord! I had no idea--&quot; He did not finish the sentence, and dived again abruptly into his narrative.</p><p>&quot;I did not see anything myself, I must admit, but the stories of independent eye-witnesses were to the effect that lines of light, like streams of thin fire, moved through the wood and sometimes were seen to shoot out precisely as flames might shoot out--in the direction of this house. There,&quot; he explained, in a louder voice that made me jump, pointing with a thick finger to the map, &quot;where the westerly fringe of the plantation comes up to the end of the lower lawn at the back of the house--where it links on to those dark patches, which are laurel shrubberies, running right up to the back premises--that&#39;s where these lights were seen. They passed from the wood to the shrubberies, and in this way reached the house itself. Like silent rockets, one man described them, rapid as lightning and exceedingly bright.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And this evidence you spoke of?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They actually reached the sides of the house. They&#39;ve left a mark of scorching on the walls--the walls of the laundry building at the other end. You shall see &#39;em tomorrow.&quot; He pointed to the map to indicate the spot, and then straightened himself and glared about the room as though he had said something no one could believe and expected contradiction.</p><p>&quot;Scorched--just as the faces were,&quot; the doctor murmured, looking significantly at me.</p><p>&quot;Scorched--yes,&quot; repeated the Colonel, failing to catch the rest of the sentence in his excitement.</p><p>There was a prolonged silence in the room, in which I heard the gurgling of the oil in the lamp and the click of the coals and the heavy breathing of our host. The most unwelcome sensations were creeping about my spine, and I wondered whether my companion would scorn me utterly if I asked to sleep on the sofa in his room. It was eleven o&#39;clock, I saw by the clock on the mantelpiece. We had crossed the dividing line and were now well in the movement of the adventure. The fight between my interest and my dread became acute. But, even if turning back had been possible, I think the interest would have easily gained the day.</p><p>&quot;I have enemies, of course,&quot; I heard the Colonel&#39;s rough voice break into the pause presently, &quot;and have discharged a number of servants---&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; put in John Silence briefly.</p><p>&quot;You think not? In a sense I am glad, and yet--there are some things that can be met and dealt with--&quot;</p><p>He left the sentence unfinished, and looked down at the floor with an expression of grim severity that betrayed a momentary glimpse of character. This fighting man loathed and abhorred the thought of an enemy he could not see and come to grips with. Presently he moved over and sat down in the chair between us. Something like a sigh escaped him. Dr. Silence said nothing.</p><p>&quot;My sister, of course, is kept in ignorance, as far as possible, of all this,&quot; he said disconnectedly, and as if talking to himself. &quot;But even if she knew she would find matter-of-fact explanations. I only wish I could. I&#39;m sure they exist.&quot;</p><p>There came then an interval in the conversation that was very significant. It did not seem a real pause, or the silence real silence, for both men continued to think so rapidly and strongly that one almost imagined their thoughts clothed themselves in words in the air of the room. I was more than a little keyed up with the strange excitement of all I had heard, but what stimulated my nerves more than anything else was the obvious fact that the doctor was clearly upon the trail of discovery. In his mind at that moment, I believe, he had already solved the nature of this perplexing psychical problem. His face was like a mask, and he employed the absolute minimum of gesture and words. All his energies were directed inwards, and by those incalculable methods and processes he had mastered with such infinite patience and study, I felt sure he was already in touch with the forces behind these singular phenomena and laying his deep plans for bringing them into the open, and then effectively dealing with them.</p><p>Colonel Wragge meanwhile grew more and more fidgety. From time to time he turned towards my companion, as though about to speak, yet always changing his mind at the last moment. Once he went over and opened the door suddenly, apparently to see if any one were listening at the keyhole, for he disappeared a moment between the two doors, and I then heard him open the outer one. He stood there for some seconds and made a noise as though he were sniffing the air like a dog. Then he closed both doors cautiously and came back to the fireplace. A strange excitement seemed growing upon him. Evidently he was trying to make up his mind to say something that he found it difficult to say. And John Silence, as I rightly judged, was waiting patiently for him to choose his own opportunity and his own way of saying it. At last he turned and faced us, squaring his great shoulders, and stiffening perceptibly.</p><p>Dr. Silence looked up sympathetically.</p><p>&quot;Your own experiences help me most,&quot; he observed quietly.</p><p>&quot;The fact is,&quot; the Colonel said, speaking very low, &quot;this past week there have been outbreaks of fire in the house itself. Three separate outbreaks--and all--in my sister&#39;s room.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the doctor said, as if this was just what he had expected to hear.</p><p>&quot;Utterly unaccountable--all of them,&quot; added the other, and then sat down. I began to understand something of the reason of his excitement. He was realising at last that the &quot;natural&quot; explanation he had held to all along was becoming impossible, and he hated it. It made him angry.</p><p>&quot;Fortunately,&quot; he went on, &quot;she was out each time and does not know. But I have made her sleep now in a room on the ground floor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A wise precaution,&quot; the doctor said simply. He asked one or two questions. The fires had started in the curtains--once by the window and once by the bed. The third time smoke had been discovered by the maid coming from the cupboard, and it was found that Miss Wragge&#39;s clothes hanging on the hooks were smouldering. The doctor listened attentively, but made no comment.</p><p>&quot;And now can you tell me,&quot; he said presently, &quot;what your own feeling about it is--your general impression?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It sounds foolish to say so,&quot; replied the soldier, after a moment&#39;s hesitation, &quot;but I feel exactly as I have often felt on active service in my Indian campaigns: just as if the house and all in it were in a state of siege; as though a concealed enemy were encamped about us--in ambush somewhere.&quot; He uttered a soft nervous laugh. &quot;As if the next sign of smoke would precipitate a panic--a dreadful panic.&quot;</p><p>The picture came before me of the night shadowing the house, and the twisted pine trees he had described crowding about it, concealing some powerful enemy; and, glancing at the resolute face and figure of the old soldier, forced at length to his confession, I understood something of all he had been through before he sought the assistance of John Silence.</p><p>&quot;And tomorrow, unless I am mistaken, is full moon,&quot; said the doctor suddenly, watching the other&#39;s face for the effect of his apparently careless words.</p><p>Colonel Wragge gave an uncontrollable start, and his face for the first time showed unmistakable pallor.</p><p>&quot;What in the world---?&quot; he began, his lip quivering.</p><p>&quot;Only that I am beginning to see light in this extraordinary affair,&quot; returned the other calmly, &quot;and, if my theory is correct, each month when the moon is at the full should witness an increase in the activity of the phenomena.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t see the connection,&quot; Colonel Wragge answered almost savagely, &quot;but I am bound to say my diary bears you out.&quot; He wore the most puzzled expression I have ever seen upon an honest face, but he abhorred this additional corroboration of an explanation that perplexed him.</p><p>&quot;I confess,&quot; he repeated, &quot;I cannot see the connection.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why should you?&quot; said the doctor, with his first laugh that evening. He got up and hung the map upon the wall again. &quot;But I do--because these things are my special study--and let me add that I have yet to come across a problem that is not natural, and has not a natural explanation. It&#39;s merely a question of how much one knows--and admits.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge eyed him with a new and curious respect in his face. But his feelings were soothed. Moreover, the doctor&#39;s laugh and change of manner came as a relief to all, and broke the spell of grave suspense that had held us so long. We all rose and stretched our limbs, and took little walks about the room.</p><p>&quot;I am glad, Dr. Silence, if you will allow me to say so, that you are here,&quot; he said simply, &quot;very glad indeed. And now I fear I have kept you both up very late,&quot; with a glance to include me, &quot;for you must be tired, and ready for your beds. I have told you all there is to tell,&quot; he added, &quot;and tomorrow you must feel perfectly free to take any steps you think necessary.&quot;</p><p>The end was abrupt, yet natural, for there was nothing more to say, and neither of these men talked for mere talking&#39;s sake.</p><p>Out in the cold and chilly hall he lit our candles and took us upstairs. The house was at rest and still, every one asleep. We moved softly. Through the windows on the stairs we saw the moonlight falling across the lawn, throwing deep shadows. The nearer pine trees were just visible in the distance, a wall of impenetrable blackness.</p><p>Our host came for a moment to our rooms to see that we had everything. He pointed to a coil of strong rope lying beside the window, fastened to the wall by means of an iron ring. Evidently it had been recently put in.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think we shall need it,&quot; Dr. Silence said, with a smile.</p><p>&quot;I trust not,&quot; replied our host gravely. &quot;I sleep quite close to you across the landing,&quot; he whispered, pointing to his door, &quot;and if you--if you want anything in the night you will know where to find me.&quot;</p><p>He wished us pleasant dreams and disappeared down the passage into his room, shading the candle with his big muscular hand from the draughts.</p><p>John Silence stopped me a moment before I went.</p><p>&quot;You know what it is?&quot; I asked, with an excitement that even overcame my weariness.</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m almost sure. And you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not the smallest notion.&quot;</p><p>He looked disappointed, but not half as disappointed as I felt.</p><p>&quot;Egypt,&quot; he whispered, &quot;Egypt!&quot;</p><p>II</p><p>Nothing happened to disturb me in the night--nothing, that is, except a nightmare in which Colonel Wragge chased me amid thin streaks of fire, and his sister always prevented my escape by suddenly rising up out of the ground in her chair--dead. The deep baying of dogs woke me once, just before the dawn, it must have been, for I saw the window frame against the sky; there was a flash of lightning, too, I thought, as I turned over in bed. And it was warm, for October oppressively warm.</p><p>It was after eleven o&#39;clock when our host suggested going out with the guns, these, we understood, being a somewhat thin disguise for our true purpose. Personally, I was glad to be in the open air, for the atmosphere of the house was heavy with presentiment. The sense of impending disaster hung over all. Fear stalked the passages, and lurked in the corners of every room. It was a house haunted, but really haunted; not by some vague shadow of the dead, but by a definite though incalculable influence that was actively alive, and dangerous. At the least smell of smoke the entire household quivered. An odour of burning, I was convinced, would paralyse all the inmates. For the servants, though professedly ignorant by the master&#39;s unspoken orders, yet shared the common dread; and the hideous uncertainty, joined with this display of so spiteful and calculated a spirit of malignity, provided a kind of black doom that draped not only the walls, but also the minds of the people living within them.</p><p>Only the bright and cheerful vision of old Miss Wragge being pushed about the house in her noiseless chair, chatting and nodding briskly to every one she met, prevented us from giving way entirely to the depression which governed the majority. The sight of her was like a gleam of sunshine through the depths of some ill-omened wood, and just as we went out I saw her being wheeled along by her attendant into the sunshine of the back lawn, and caught her cheery smile as she turned her head and wished us good sport.</p><p>The morning was October at its best. Sunshine glistened on the dew-drenched grass and on leaves turned golden-red. The dainty messengers of coming hoar-frost were already in the air, a search for permanent winter quarters. From the wide moors that everywhere swept up against the sky, like a purple sea splashed by the occasional grey of rocky clefts, there stole down the cool and perfumed wind of the west. And the keen taste of the sea ran through all like a master-flavour, borne over the spaces perhaps by the seagulls that cried and circled high in the air.</p><p>But our host took little interest in this sparkling beauty, and had no thought of showing off the scenery of his property. His mind was otherwise intent, and, for that matter, so were our own.</p><p>&quot;Those bleak moors and hills stretch unbroken for hours,&quot; he said, with a sweep of the hand; &quot;and over there, some four miles,&quot; pointing in another direction, &quot;lies S---- Bay, a long, swampy inlet of the sea, haunted by myriads of seabirds. On the other side of the house are the plantations and pine-woods. I thought we would get the dogs and go first to the Twelve Acre Wood I told you about last night. It&#39;s quite near.&quot;</p><p>We found the dogs in the stable, and I recalled the deep baying of the night when a fine bloodhound and two great Danes leaped out to greet us. Singular companions for guns, I thought to myself, as we struck out across the fields and the great creatures bounded and ran beside us, nose to ground.</p><p>The conversation was scanty. John Silence&#39;s grave face did not encourage talk. He wore the expression I knew well--that look of earnest solicitude which meant that his whole being was deeply absorbed and preoccupied. Frightened, I had never seen him, but anxious often--it always moved me to witness it--and he was anxious now.</p><p>&quot;On the way back you shall see the laundry building,&quot; Colonel Wragge observed shortly, for he, too, found little to say. &quot;We shall attract less attention then.&quot;</p><p>Yet not all the crisp beauty of the morning seemed able to dispel the feelings of uneasy dread that gathered increasingly about our minds as we went.</p><p>In a very few minutes a clump of pine trees concealed the house from view, and we found ourselves on the outskirts of a densely grown plantation of conifers. Colonel Wragge stopped abruptly, and, producing a map from his pocket, explained once more very briefly its position with regard to the house. He showed how it ran up almost to the walls of the laundry building--though at the moment beyond our actual view--and pointed to the windows of his sister&#39;s bedroom where the fires had been. The room, now empty, looked straight on to the wood. Then, glancing nervously about him, and calling the dogs to heel, he proposed that we should enter the plantation and make as thorough examination of it as we thought worth while. The dogs, he added, might perhaps be persuaded to accompany us a little way--and he pointed to where they cowered at his feet--but he doubted it. &quot;Neither voice nor whip will get them very far, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; he said. &quot;I know by experience.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you have no objection,&quot; replied Dr. Silence, with decision, and speaking almost for the first time, &quot;we will make our examination alone--Mr. Hubbard and myself. It will be best so.&quot;</p><p>His tone was absolutely final, and the Colonel acquiesced so politely that even a less intuitive man than myself must have seen that he was genuinely relieved.</p><p>&quot;You doubtless have good reasons,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Merely that I wish to obtain my impressions uncoloured. This delicate clue I am working on might be so easily blurred by the thought-currents of another mind with strongly preconceived ideas.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perfectly. I understand,&quot; rejoined the soldier, though with an expression of countenance that plainly contradicted his words. &quot;Then I will wait here with the dogs; and we&#39;ll have a look at the laundry on our way home.&quot;</p><p>I turned once to look back as we clambered over the low stone wall built by the late owner, and saw his straight, soldierly figure standing in the sunlit field watching us with a curiously intent look on his face. There was something to me incongruous, yet distinctly pathetic, in the man&#39;s efforts to meet all far-fetched explanations of the mystery with contempt, and at the same time in his stolid, unswerving investigation of it all. He nodded at me and made a gesture of farewell with his hand. That picture of him, standing in the sunshine with his big dogs, steadily watching us, remains with me to this day.</p><p>Dr. Silence led the way in among the twisted trunks, planted closely together in serried ranks, and I followed sharp at his heels. The moment we were out of sight he turned and put down his gun against the roots of a big tree, and I did likewise.</p><p>&quot;We shall hardly want these cumbersome weapons of murder,&quot; he observed, with a passing smile.</p><p>&quot;You are sure of your clue, then?&quot; I asked at once, bursting with curiosity, yet fearing to betray it lest he should think me unworthy. His own methods were so absolutely simple and untheatrical.</p><p>&quot;I am sure of my clue,&quot; he answered gravely. &quot;And I think we have come just in time. You shall know in due course. For the present--be content to follow and observe. And think, steadily. The support of your mind will help me.&quot;</p><p>His voice had that quiet mastery in it which leads men to face death with a sort of happiness and pride. I would have followed him anywhere at that moment. At the same time his words conveyed a sense of dread seriousness. I caught the thrill of his confidence; but also, in this broad light of day, I felt the measure of alarm that lay behind.</p><p>&quot;You still have no strong impressions?&quot; he asked. &quot;Nothing happened in the night, for instance? No vivid dreamings?&quot;</p><p>He looked closely for my answer, I was aware.</p><p>&quot;I slept almost an unbroken sleep. I was tremendously tired, you know, and, but for the oppressive heat--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good! You still notice the heat, then,&quot; he said to himself, rather than expecting an answer. &quot;And the lightning?&quot; he added, &quot;that lightning out of a clear sky--that flashing--did you notice <em>that</em>?&quot;</p><p>I answered truly that I thought I had seen a flash during a moment of wakefulness, and he then drew my attention to certain facts before moving on.</p><p>&quot;You remember the sensation of warmth when you put the letter to your forehead in the train; the heat generally in the house last evening, and, as you now mention, in the night. You heard, too, the Colonel&#39;s stories about the appearances of fire in this wood and in the house itself, and the way his brother and the gamekeeper came to their deaths twenty years ago.&quot;</p><p>I nodded, wondering what in the world it all meant.</p><p>&quot;And you get no clue from these facts?&quot; he asked, a trifle surprised.</p><p>I searched every corner of my mind and imagination for some inkling of his meaning, but was obliged to admit that I understood nothing so far.</p><p>&quot;Never mind, you will later. And now,&quot; he added, &quot;we will go over the wood and see what we can find.&quot;</p><p>His words explained to me something of his method. We were to keep our minds alert and report to each other the least fancy that crossed the picture-gallery of our thoughts. Then, just as we started, he turned again to me with a final warning.</p><p>&quot;And, for your safety,&quot; he said earnestly, &quot;imagine <em>now</em>--and for that matter, imagine always until we leave this place--imagine with the utmost keenness, that you are surrounded by a shell that protects you. Picture yourself inside a protective envelope, and build it up with the most intense imagination you can evoke. Pour the whole force of your thought and will into it. Believe vividly all through this adventure that such a shell, constructed of your thought, will and imagination, surrounds you completely, and that nothing can pierce it to attack.&quot;</p><p>He spoke with dramatic conviction, gazing hard at me as though to enforce his meaning, and then moved forward and began to pick his way over the rough, tussocky ground into the wood. And meanwhile, knowing the efficacy of his prescription, I adopted it to the best of my ability.</p><p>The trees at once closed about us like the night. Their branches met overhead in a continuous tangle, their stems crept closer and closer, the brambly undergrowth thickened and multiplied. We tore our trousers, scratched our hands, and our eyes filled with fine dust that made it most difficult to avoid the clinging, prickly network of branches and creepers. Coarse white grass that caught our feet like string grew here and there in patches. It crowned the lumps of peaty growth that stuck up like human heads, fantastically dressed, thrusting up at us out of the ground with crests of dead hair. We stumbled and floundered among them. It was hard going, and I could well conceive it impossible to find a way at all in the night-time. We jumped, when possible, from tussock to tussock, and it seemed as though we were springing among heads on a battlefield, and that this dead white grass concealed eyes that turned to stare as we passed.</p><p>Here and there the sunlight shot in with vivid spots of white light, dazzling the sight, but only making the surrounding gloom deeper by contrast. And on two occasions we passed dark circular places in the grass where fires had eaten their mark and left a ring of ashes. Dr. Silence pointed to them, but without comment and without pausing, and the sight of them woke in me a singular realisation of the dread that lay so far only just out of sight in this adventure.</p><p>It was exhausting work, and heavy going. We kept close together. The warmth, too, was extraordinary. Yet it did not seem the warmth of the body due to violent exertion, but rather an inner heat of the mind that laid glowing hands of fire upon the heart and set the brain in a kind of steady blaze. When my companion found himself too far in advance, he waited for me to come up. The place had evidently been untouched by hand of man, keeper, forester or sportsman, for many a year; and my thoughts, as we advanced painfully, were not unlike the state of the wood itself--dark, confused, full of a haunting wonder and the shadow of fear.</p><p>By this time all signs of the open field behind us were hid. No single gleam penetrated. We might have been groping in the heart of some primeval forest. Then, suddenly, the brambles and tussocks and stringlike grass came to an end; the trees opened out; and the ground began to slope upwards towards a large central mound. We had reached the middle of the plantation, and before us stood the broken Druid stones our host had mentioned. We walked easily up the little hill, between the sparser stems, and, resting upon one of the ivy-covered boulders, looked round upon a comparatively open space, as large, perhaps, as a small London Square.</p><p>Thinking of the ceremonies and sacrifices this rough circle of prehistoric monoliths might have witnessed, I looked up into my companion&#39;s face with an unspoken question. But he read my thought and shook his head.</p><p>&quot;Our mystery has nothing to do with these dead symbols,&quot; he said, &quot;but with something perhaps even more ancient, and of another country altogether.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Egypt?&quot; I said half under my breath, hopelessly puzzled, but recalling his words in my bedroom.</p><p>He nodded. Mentally I still floundered, but he seemed intensely preoccupied and it was no time for asking questions; so while his words circled unintelligibly in my mind I looked round at the scene before me, glad of the opportunity to recover breath and some measure of composure. But hardly had I time to notice the twisted and contorted shapes of many of the pine trees close at hand when Dr. Silence leaned over and touched me on the shoulder. He pointed down the slope. And the look I saw in his eyes keyed up every nerve in my body to its utmost pitch.</p><p>A thin, almost imperceptible column of blue smoke was rising among the trees some twenty yards away at the foot of the mound. It curled up and up, and disappeared from sight among the tangled branches overhead. It was scarcely thicker than the smoke from a small brand of burning wood.</p><p>&quot;Protect yourself! Imagine your shell strongly,&quot; whispered the doctor sharply, &quot;and follow me closely.&quot;</p><p>He rose at once and moved swiftly down the slope towards the smoke, and I followed, afraid to remain alone. I heard the soft crunching of our steps on the pine needles. Over his shoulder I watched the thin blue spiral, without once taking my eyes off it. I hardly know how to describe the peculiar sense of vague horror inspired in me by the sight of that streak of smoke pencilling its way upwards among the dark trees. And the sensation of increasing heat as we approached was phenomenal. It was like walking towards a glowing yet invisible fire.</p><p>As we drew nearer his pace slackened. Then he stopped and pointed, and I saw a small circle of burnt grass upon the ground. The tussocks were blackened and smouldering, and from the centre rose this line of smoke, pale, blue, steady. Then I noticed a movement of the atmosphere beside us, as if the warm air were rising and the cooler air rushing in to take its place: a little centre of wind in the stillness. Overhead the boughs stirred and trembled where the smoke disappeared. Otherwise, not a tree sighed, not a sound made itself heard. The wood was still as a graveyard. A horrible idea came to me that the course of nature was about to change without warning, had changed a little already, that the sky would drop, or the surface of the earth crash inwards like a broken bubble. Something, certainly, reached up to the citadel of my reason, causing its throne to shake.</p><p>John Silence moved forward again. I could not see his face, but his attitude was plainly one of resolution, of muscles and mind ready for vigorous action. We were within ten feet of the blackened circle when the smoke of a sudden ceased to rise, and vanished. The tail of the column disappeared in the air above, and at the same instant it seemed to me that the sensation of heat passed from my face, and the motion of the wind was gone. The calm spirit of the fresh October day resumed command.</p><p>Side by side we advanced and examined the place. The grass was smouldering, the ground still hot. The circle of burned earth was a foot to a foot and a half in diameter. It looked like an ordinary picnic fireplace. I bent down cautiously to look, but in a second I sprang back with an involuntary cry of alarm, for, as the doctor stamped on the ashes to prevent them spreading, a sound of hissing rose from the spot as though he had kicked a living creature. This hissing was faintly audible in the air. It moved past us, away towards the thicker portion of the wood in the direction of our field, and in a second Dr. Silence had left the fire and started in pursuit.</p><p>And then began the most extraordinary hunt of invisibility I can ever conceive.</p><p>He went fast even at the beginning, and, of course, it was perfectly obvious that he was following something. To judge by the poise of his head he kept his eyes steadily at a certain level--just above the height of a man--and the consequence was he stumbled a good deal over the roughness of the ground. The hissing sound had stopped. There was no sound of any kind, and what he saw to follow was utterly beyond me. I only know, that in mortal dread of being left behind, and with a biting curiosity to see whatever there was to be seen, I followed as quickly as I could, and even then barely succeeded in keeping up with him.</p><p>And, as we went, the whole mad jumble of the Colonel&#39;s stories ran through my brain, touching a sense of frightened laughter that was only held in check by the sight of this earnest, hurrying figure before me. For John Silence at work inspired me with a kind of awe. He looked so diminutive among these giant twisted trees, while yet I knew that his purpose and his knowledge were so great, and even in hurry he was dignified. The fancy that we were playing some queer, exaggerated game together met the fact that we were two men dancing upon the brink of some possible tragedy, and the mingling of the two emotions in my mind was both grotesque and terrifying.</p><p>He never turned in his mad chase, but pushed rapidly on, while I panted after him like a figure in some unreasoning nightmare. And, as I ran, it came upon me that he had been aware all the time, in his quiet, internal way, of many things that he had kept for his own secret consideration; he had been watching, waiting, planning from the very moment we entered the shade of the wood. By some inner, concentrated process of mind, dynamic if not actually magical, he had been in direct contact with the source of the whole adventure, the very essence of the real mystery. And now the forces were moving to a climax. Something was about to happen, something important, something possibly dreadful. Every nerve, every sense, every significant gesture of the plunging figure before me proclaimed the fact just as surely as the skies, the winds, and the face of the earth tell the birds the time to migrate and warn the animals that danger lurks and they must move.</p><p>In a few moments we reached the foot of the mound and entered the tangled undergrowth that lay between us and the sunlight of the field. Here the difficulties of fast travelling increased a hundredfold. There were brambles to dodge, low boughs to dive under, and countless tree trunks closing up to make a direct path impossible. Yet Dr. Silence never seemed to falter or hesitate. He went, diving, jumping, dodging, ducking, but ever in the same main direction, following a clean trail. Twice I tripped and fell, and both times, when I picked myself up again, I saw him ahead of me, still forcing a way like a dog after its quarry. And sometimes, like a dog, he stopped and pointed--human pointing it was, psychic pointing, and each time he stopped to point I heard that faint high hissing in the air beyond us. The instinct of an infallible dowser possessed him, and he made no mistakes.</p><p>At length, abruptly, I caught up with him, and found that we stood at the edge of the shallow pond Colonel Wragge had mentioned in his account the night before. It was long and narrow, filled with dark brown water, in which the trees were dimly reflected. Not a ripple stirred its surface.</p><p>&quot;Watch!&quot; he cried out, as I came up. &quot;It&#39;s going to cross. It&#39;s bound to betray itself. The water is its natural enemy, and we shall see the direction.&quot;</p><p>And, even as he spoke, a thin line like the track of a water-spider, shot swiftly across the shiny surface; there was a ghost of steam in the air above; and immediately I became aware of an odour of burning.</p><p>Dr. Silence turned and shot a glance at me that made me think of lightning. I began to shake all over.</p><p>&quot;Quick!&quot; he cried with excitement, &quot;to the trail again! We must run around. It&#39;s going to the house!&quot;</p><p>The alarm in his voice quite terrified me. Without a false step I dashed round the slippery banks and dived again at his heels into the sea of bushes and tree trunks. We were now in the thick of the very dense belt that ran around the outer edge of the plantation, and the field was near; yet so dark was the tangle that it was some time before the first shafts of white sunlight became visible. The doctor now ran in zigzags. He was following something that dodged and doubled quite wonderfully, yet had begun, I fancied, to move more slowly than before.</p><p>&quot;Quick!&quot; he cried. &quot;In the light we shall lose it!&quot;</p><p>I still saw nothing, heard nothing, caught no suggestion of a trail; yet this man, guided by some interior divining that seemed infallible, made no false turns, though how he failed to crash headlong into the trees has remained a mystery to me ever since. And then, with a sudden rush, we found ourselves on the skirts of the wood with the open field lying in bright sunshine before our eyes.</p><p>&quot;Too late!&quot; I heard him cry, a note of anguish in his voice. &quot;It&#39;s out--and, by God, it&#39;s making for the house!&quot;</p><p>I saw the Colonel standing in the field with his dogs where we had left him. He was bending double, peering into the wood where he heard us running, and he straightened up like a bent whip released. John Silence dashed passed, calling him to follow.</p><p>&quot;We shall lose the trail in the light,&quot; I heard him cry as he ran. &quot;But quick! We may yet get there in time!&quot;</p><p>That wild rush across the open field, with the dogs at our heels, leaping and barking, and the elderly Colonel behind us running as though for his life, shall I ever forget it? Though I had only vague ideas of the meaning of it all, I put my best foot forward, and, being the youngest of the three, I reached the house an easy first. I drew up, panting, and turned to wait for the others. But, as I turned, something moving a little distance away caught my eye, and in that moment I swear I experienced the most overwhelming and singular shock of surprise and terror I have ever known, or can conceive as possible.</p><p>For the front door was open, and the waist of the house being narrow, I could see through the hall into the dining-room beyond, and so out on to the back lawn, and there I saw no less a sight than the figure of Miss Wragge--running. Even at that distance it was plain that she had seen me, and was coming fast towards me, running with the frantic gait of a terror-stricken woman. She had recovered the use of her legs.</p><p>Her face was a livid grey, as of death itself, but the general expression was one of laughter, for her mouth was gaping, and her eyes, always bright, shone with the light of a wild merriment that seemed the merriment of a child, yet was singularly ghastly. And that very second, as she fled past me into her brother&#39;s arms behind, I smelt again most unmistakably the odour of burning, and to this day the smell of smoke and fire can come very near to turning me sick with the memory of what I had seen.</p><p>Fast on her heels, too, came the terrified attendant, more mistress of herself, and able to speak--which the old lady could not do--but with a face almost, if not quite, as fearful.</p><p>&quot;We were down by the bushes in the sun,&quot;--she gasped and screamed in reply to Colonel Wragge&#39;s distracted questionings,--&quot;I was wheeling the chair as usual when she shrieked and leaped--I don&#39;t know exactly--I was too frightened to see--Oh, my God! she jumped clean out of the chair--<em>and ran</em>! There was a blast of hot air from the wood, and she hid her face and jumped. She didn&#39;t make a sound--she didn&#39;t cry out, or make a sound. She just ran.&quot;</p><p>But the nightmare horror of it all reached the breaking point a few minutes later, and while I was still standing in the hall temporarily bereft of speech and movement; for while the doctor, the Colonel and the attendant were half-way up the staircase, helping the fainting woman to the privacy of her room, and all in a confused group of dark figures, there sounded a voice behind me, and I turned to see the butler, his face dripping with perspiration, his eyes starting out of his head.</p><p>&quot;The laundry&#39;s on fire!&quot; he cried; &quot;the laundry building&#39;s a-caught!&quot;</p><p>I remember his odd expression &quot;a-caught,&quot; and wanting to laugh, but finding my face rigid and inflexible.</p><p>&quot;The devil&#39;s about again, s&#39;help me Gawd!&quot; he cried, in a voice thin with terror, running about in circles.</p><p>And then the group on the stairs scattered as at the sound of a shot, and the Colonel and Dr. Silence came down three steps at a time, leaving the afflicted Miss Wragge to the care of her single attendant.</p><p>We were out across the front lawn in a moment and round the corner of the house, the Colonel leading, Silence and I at his heels, and the portly butler puffing some distance in the rear, getting more and more mixed in his addresses to God and the devil; and the moment we passed the stables and came into view of the laundry building, we saw a wicked-looking volume of smoke pouring out of the narrow windows, and the frightened women-servants and grooms running hither and thither, calling aloud as they ran.</p><p>The arrival of the master restored order instantly, and this retired soldier, poor thinker perhaps, but capable man of action, had the matter in hand from the start. He issued orders like a martinet, and, almost before I could realise it, there were streaming buckets on the scene and a line of men and women formed between the building and the stable pump.</p><p>&quot;Inside,&quot; I heard John Silence cry, and the Colonel followed him through the door, while I was just quick enough at their heels to hear him add, &quot;the smoke&#39;s the worst part of it. There&#39;s no fire yet, I think.&quot;</p><p>And, true enough, there was no fire. The interior was thick with smoke, but it speedily cleared and not a single bucket was used upon the floor or walls. The air was stifling, the heat fearful.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s precious little to burn in here; it&#39;s all stone,&quot; the Colonel exclaimed, coughing. But the doctor was pointing to the wooden covers of the great cauldron in which the clothes were washed, and we saw that these were smouldering and charred. And when we sprinkled half a bucket of water on them the surrounding bricks hissed and fizzed and sent up clouds of steam. Through the open door and windows this passed out with the rest of the smoke, and we three stood there on the brick floor staring at the spot and wondering, each in our own fashion, how in the name of natural law the place could have caught fire or smoked at all. And each was silent--myself from sheer incapacity and befuddlement, the Colonel from the quiet pluck that faces all things yet speaks little, and John Silence from the intense mental grappling with this latest manifestation of a profound problem that called for concentration of thought rather than for any words.</p><p>There was really nothing to say. The facts were indisputable.</p><p>Colonel Wragge was the first to utter.</p><p>&quot;My sister,&quot; he said briefly, and moved off. In the yard I heard him sending the frightened servants about their business in an excellently matter-of-fact voice, scolding some one roundly for making such a big fire and letting the flues get over-heated, and paying no heed to the stammering reply that no fire had been lit there for several days. Then he dispatched a groom on horseback for the local doctor.</p><p>Then Dr. Silence turned and looked at me. The absolute control he possessed, not only over the outward expression of emotion by gesture, change of colour, light in the eyes, and so forth, but also, as I well knew, over its very birth in his heart, the masklike face of the dead he could assume at will, made it extremely difficult to know at any given moment what was at work in his inner consciousness. But now, when he turned and looked at me, there was no sphinx-expression there, but rather the keen triumphant face of a man who had solved a dangerous and complicated problem, and saw his way to a clean victory.</p><p>&quot;<em>Now</em> do you guess?&quot; he asked quietly, as though it were the simplest matter in the world, and ignorance were impossible.</p><p>I could only stare stupidly and remain silent. He glanced down at the charred cauldron-lids, and traced a figure in the air with his finger. But I was too excited, or too mortified, or still too dazed, perhaps, to see what it was he outlined, or what it was he meant to convey. I could only go on staring and shaking my puzzled head.</p><p>&quot;A fire-elemental,&quot; he cried, &quot;a fire-elemental of the most powerful and malignant kind--&quot;</p><p>&quot;A what?&quot; thundered the voice of Colonel Wragge behind us, having returned suddenly and overheard.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a fire-elemental,&quot; repeated Dr. Silence more calmly, but with a note of triumph in his voice he could not keep out, &quot;and a fire-elemental enraged.&quot;</p><p>The light began to dawn in my mind at last. But the Colonel--who had never heard the term before, and was besides feeling considerably worked up for a plain man with all this mystery he knew not how to grapple with--the Colonel stood, with the most dumfoundered look ever seen on a human countenance, and continued to roar, and stammer, and stare.</p><p>&quot;And why,&quot; he began, savage with the desire to find something visible he could fight--&quot;why, in the name of all the blazes--?&quot; and then stopped as John Silence moved up and took his arm.</p><p>&quot;There, my dear Colonel Wragge,&quot; he said gently, &quot;you touch the heart of the whole thing. You ask &#39;Why.&#39; That is precisely our problem.&quot; He held the soldier&#39;s eyes firmly with his own. &quot;And that, too, I think, we shall soon know. Come and let us talk over a plan of action--that room with the double doors, perhaps.&quot;</p><p>The word &quot;action&quot; calmed him a little, and he led the way, without further speech, back into the house, and down the long stone passage to the room where we had heard his stories on the night of our arrival. I understood from the doctor&#39;s glance that my presence would not make the interview easier for our host, and I went upstairs to my own room--shaking.</p><p>But in the solitude of my room the vivid memories of the last hour revived so mercilessly that I began to feel I should never in my whole life lose the dreadful picture of Miss Wragge running--that dreadful human climax after all the non-human mystery in the wood--and I was not sorry when a servant knocked at my door and said that Colonel Wragge would be glad if I would join them in the little smoking-room.</p><p>&quot;I think it is better you should be present,&quot; was all Colonel Wragge said as I entered the room. I took the chair with my back to the window. There was still an hour before lunch, though I imagine that the usual divisions of the day hardly found a place in the thoughts of any one of us.</p><p>The atmosphere of the room was what I might call electric. The Colonel was positively bristling; he stood with his back to the fire, fingering an unlit black cigar, his face flushed, his being obviously roused and ready for action. He hated this mystery. It was poisonous to his nature, and he longed to meet something face to face--something he could gauge and fight. Dr. Silence, I noticed at once, was sitting before the map of the estate which was spread upon a table. I knew by his expression the state of his mind. He was in the thick of it all, knew it, delighted in it, and was working at high pressure. He recognised my presence with a lifted eyelid, and the flash of the eye, contrasted with his stillness and composure, told me volumes.</p><p>&quot;I was about to explain to our host briefly what seems to me afoot in all this business,&quot; he said without looking up, &quot;when he asked that you should join us so that we can all work together.&quot; And, while signifying my assent, I caught myself wondering what quality it was in the calm speech of this undemonstrative man that was so full of power, so charged with the strange, virile personality behind it and that seemed to inspire us with his own confidence as by a process of radiation.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Hubbard,&quot; he went on gravely, turning to the soldier, &quot;knows something of my methods, and in more than one--er--interesting situation has proved of assistance. What we want now&quot;--and here he suddenly got up and took his place on the mat beside the Colonel, and looked hard at him--&quot;is men who have self-control, who are sure of themselves, whose minds at the critical moment will emit positive forces, instead of the wavering and uncertain currents due to negative feelings--due, for instance, to fear.&quot;</p><p>He looked at us each in turn. Colonel Wragge moved his feet farther apart, and squared his shoulders; and I felt guilty but said nothing, conscious that my latent store of courage was being deliberately hauled to the front. He was winding me up like a clock.</p><p>&quot;So that, in what is yet to come,&quot; continued our leader, &quot;each of us will contribute his share of power, and ensure success for my plan.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not afraid of anything I can <em>see</em>,&quot; said the Colonel bluntly.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; I heard myself say, as it were automatically, &quot;for anything,&quot; and then added, feeling the declaration was lamely insufficient, &quot;and everything.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence left the mat and began walking to and fro about the room, both hands plunged deep into the pockets of his shooting-jacket. Tremendous vitality streamed from him. I never took my eyes off the small, moving figure; small yes,--and yet somehow making me think of a giant plotting the destruction of worlds. And his manner was gentle, as always, soothing almost, and his words uttered quietly without emphasis or emotion. Most of what he said was addressed, though not too obviously, to the Colonel.</p><p>&quot;The violence of this sudden attack,&quot; he said softly, pacing to and fro beneath the bookcase at the end of the room, &quot;is due, of course, partly to the fact that tonight the moon is at the full&quot;--here he glanced at me for a moment--&quot;and partly to the fact that we have all been so deliberately concentrating upon the matter. Our thinking, our investigation, has stirred it into unusual activity. I mean that the intelligent force behind these manifestations has realised that some one is busied about its destruction. And it is now on the defensive: more, it is aggressive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But &#39;it&#39;--what is &#39;it&#39;?&quot; began the soldier, fuming. &quot;What, in the name of all that&#39;s dreadful, <em>is</em> a fire-elemental?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I cannot give you at this moment,&quot; replied Dr. Silence, turning to him, but undisturbed by the interruption, &quot;a lecture on the nature and history of magic, but can only say that an Elemental is the active force behind the elements,--whether earth, air, water, <em>or fire</em>,--it is impersonal in its essential nature, but can be focused, personified, ensouled, so to say, by those who know how--by magicians, if you will--for certain purposes of their own, much in the same way that steam and electricity can be harnessed by the practical man of this century.</p><p>&quot;Alone, these blind elemental energies can accomplish little, but governed and directed by the trained will of a powerful manipulator they may become potent activities for good or evil. They are the basis of all magic, and it is the motive behind them that constitutes the magic &#39;black&#39; or &#39;white&#39;; they can be the vehicles of curses or of blessings, for a curse is nothing more than the thought of a violent will perpetuated. And in such cases--cases like this--the conscious, directing will of the mind that is using the elemental stands always behind the phenomena--&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think that my brother--!&quot; broke in the Colonel, aghast.</p><p>&quot;Has nothing whatever to do with it--directly. The fire-elemental that has here been tormenting you and your household was sent upon its mission long before you, or your family, or your ancestors, or even the nation you belong to--unless I am much mistaken--was even in existence. We will come to that a little later; after the experiment I propose to make we shall be more positive. At present I can only say we have to deal now, not only with the phenomenon of Attacking Fire merely, but with the vindictive and enraged intelligence that is directing it from behind the scenes--vindictive and enraged,&quot;--he repeated the words.</p><p>&quot;That explains--&quot; began Colonel Wragge, seeking furiously for words he could not find quickly enough.</p><p>&quot;Much,&quot; said John Silence, with a gesture to restrain him.</p><p>He stopped a moment in the middle of his walk, and a deep silence came down over the little room. Through the windows the sunlight seemed less bright, the long line of dark hills less friendly, making me think of a vast wave towering to heaven and about to break and overwhelm us. Something formidable had crept into the world about us. For, undoubtedly, there was a disquieting thought, holding terror as well as awe, in the picture his words conjured up: the conception of a human will reaching its deathless hand, spiteful and destructive, down through the ages, to strike the living and afflict the innocent.</p><p>&quot;But what is its object?&quot; burst out the soldier, unable to restrain himself longer in the silence. &quot;Why does it come from that plantation? And why should it attack us, or any one in particular?&quot; Questions began to pour from him in a stream.</p><p>&quot;All in good time,&quot; the doctor answered quietly, having let him run on for several minutes. &quot;But I must first discover positively what, or who, it is that directs this particular fire-elemental. And, to do that, we must first&quot;--he spoke with slow deliberation--&quot;seek to capture--to confine by visibility--to limit its sphere in a concrete form.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good heavens almighty!&quot; exclaimed the soldier, mixing his words in his unfeigned surprise.</p><p>&quot;Quite so,&quot; pursued the other calmly; &quot;for in so doing I think we can release it from the purpose that binds it, restore it to its normal condition of latent fire, and also&quot;--he lowered his voice perceptibly --&quot;also discover the face and form of the Being that ensouls it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The man behind the gun!&quot; cried the Colonel, beginning to understand something, and leaning forward so as not to miss a single syllable.</p><p>&quot;I mean that in the last resort, before it returns to the womb of potential fire, it will probably assume the face and figure of its Director, of the man of magical knowledge who originally bound it with his incantations and sent it forth upon its mission of centuries.&quot;</p><p>The soldier sat down and gasped openly in his face, breathing hard; but it was a very subdued voice that framed the question.</p><p>&quot;And how do you propose to make it visible? How capture and confine it? What d&#39;ye mean, Dr. John Silence?&quot;</p><p>&quot;By furnishing it with the materials for a form. By the process of materialisation simply. Once limited by dimensions, it will become slow, heavy, visible. We can then dissipate it. Invisible fire, you see, is dangerous and incalculable; locked up in a form we can perhaps manage it. We must betray it--to its death.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And this material?&quot; we asked in the same breath, although I think I had already guessed.</p><p>&quot;Not pleasant, but effective,&quot; came the quiet reply; &quot;the exhalations of freshly spilled blood.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not human blood!&quot; cried Colonel Wragge, starting up from his chair with a voice like an explosion. I thought his eyes would start from their sockets.</p><p>The face of Dr. Silence relaxed in spite of himself, and his spontaneous little laugh brought a welcome though momentary relief.</p><p>&quot;The days of human sacrifice, I hope, will never come again,&quot; he explained. &quot;Animal blood will answer the purpose, and we can make the experiment as pleasant as possible. Only, the blood must be freshly spilled and strong with the vital emanations that attract this peculiar class of elemental creature. Perhaps--perhaps if some pig on the estate is ready for the market--&quot;</p><p>He turned to hide a smile; but the passing touch of comedy found no echo in the mind of our host, who did not understand how to change quickly from one emotion to another. Clearly he was debating many things laboriously in his honest brain. But, in the end, the earnestness and scientific disinterestedness of the doctor, whose influence over him was already very great, won the day, and he presently looked up more calmly, and observed shortly that he thought perhaps the matter could be arranged.</p><p>&quot;There are other and pleasanter methods,&quot; Dr. Silence went on to explain, &quot;but they require time and preparation, and things have gone much too far, in my opinion, to admit of delay. And the process need cause you no distress: we sit round the bowl and await results. Nothing more. The emanations of blood--which, as Levi says, is the first incarnation of the universal fluid--furnish the materials out of which the creatures of discarnate life, spirits if you prefer, can fashion themselves a temporary appearance. The process is old, and lies at the root of all blood sacrifice. It was known to the priests of Baal, and it is known to the modern ecstasy dancers who cut themselves to produce objective phantoms who dance with them. And the least gifted clairvoyant could tell you that the forms to be seen in the vicinity of slaughter-houses, or hovering above the deserted battlefields, are--well, simply beyond all description. I do not mean,&quot; he added, noticing the uneasy fidgeting of his host, &quot;that anything in our laundry-experiment need appear to terrify us, for this case seems a comparatively simple one, and it is only the vindictive character of the intelligence directing this fire-elemental that causes anxiety and makes for personal danger.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is curious,&quot; said the Colonel, with a sudden rush of words, drawing a deep breath, and as though speaking of things distasteful to him, &quot;that during my years among the Hill Tribes of Northern India I came across--personally came across--instances of the sacrifices of blood to certain deities being stopped suddenly, and all manner of disasters happening until they were resumed. Fires broke out in the huts, and even on the clothes, of the natives--and--and I admit I have read, in the course of my studies,&quot;--he made a gesture toward his books and heavily laden table,--&quot;of the Yezidis of Syria evoking phantoms by means of cutting their bodies with knives during their whirling dances--enormous globes of fire which turned into monstrous and terrible forms--and I remember an account somewhere, too, how the emaciated forms and pallid countenances of the spectres, that appeared to the Emperor Julian, claimed to be the true Immortals, and told him to renew the sacrifices of blood &#39;for the fumes of which, since the establishment of Christianity, they had been pining&#39;--that these were in reality the phantoms evoked by the rites of blood.&quot;</p><p>Both Dr. Silence and myself listened in amazement, for this sudden speech was so unexpected, and betrayed so much more knowledge than we had either of us suspected in the old soldier.</p><p>&quot;Then perhaps you have read, too,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;how the Cosmic Deities of savage races, elemental in their nature, have been kept alive through many ages by these blood rites?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; he answered; &quot;that is new to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In any case,&quot; Dr. Silence added, &quot;I am glad you are not wholly unfamiliar with the subject, for you will now bring more sympathy, and therefore more help, to our experiment. For, of course, in this case, we only want the blood to tempt the creature from its lair and enclose it in a form--&quot;</p><p>&quot;I quite understand. And I only hesitated just now,&quot; he went on, his words coming much more slowly, as though he felt he had already said too much, &quot;because I wished to be quite sure it was no mere curiosity, but an actual sense of necessity that dictated this horrible experiment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is your safety, and that of your household, and of your sister, that is at stake,&quot; replied the doctor. &quot;Once I have <em>seen</em>, I hope to discover whence this elemental comes, and what its real purpose is.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge signified his assent with a bow.</p><p>&quot;And the moon will help us,&quot; the other said, &quot;for it will be full in the early hours of the morning, and this kind of elemental-being is always most active at the period of full moon. Hence, you see, the clue furnished by your diary.&quot;</p><p>So it was finally settled. Colonel Wragge would provide the materials for the experiment, and we were to meet at midnight. How he would contrive at that hour--but that was his business. I only know we both realised that he would keep his word, and whether a pig died at midnight, or at noon, was after all perhaps only a question of the sleep and personal comfort of the executioner.</p><p>&quot;Tonight, then, in the laundry,&quot; said Dr. Silence finally, to clinch the plan; &quot;we three alone--and at midnight, when the household is asleep and we shall be free from disturbance.&quot;</p><p>He exchanged significant glances with our host, who, at that moment, was called away by the announcement that the family doctor had arrived, and was ready to see him in his sister&#39;s room.</p><p>For the remainder of the afternoon John Silence disappeared. I had my suspicions that he made a secret visit to the plantation and also to the laundry building; but, in any case, we saw nothing of him, and he kept strictly to himself. He was preparing for the night, I felt sure, but the nature of his preparations I could only guess. There was movement in his room, I heard, and an odour like incense hung about the door, and knowing that he regarded rites as the vehicles of energies, my guesses were probably not far wrong.</p><p>Colonel Wragge, too, remained absent the greater part of the afternoon, and, deeply afflicted, had scarcely left his sister&#39;s bedside, but in response to my inquiry when we met for a moment at tea-time, he told me that although she had moments of attempted speech, her talk was quite incoherent and hysterical, and she was still quite unable to explain the nature of what she had seen. The doctor, he said, feared she had recovered the use of her limbs, only to lose that of her memory, and perhaps even of her mind.</p><p>&quot;Then the recovery of her legs, I trust, may be permanent, at any rate,&quot; I ventured, finding it difficult to know what sympathy to offer. And he replied with a curious short laugh, &quot;Oh yes; about that there can be no doubt whatever.&quot;</p><p>And it was due merely to the chance of my overhearing a fragment of conversation--unwillingly, of course--that a little further light was thrown upon the state in which the old lady actually lay. For, as I came out of my room, it happened that Colonel Wragge and the doctor were going downstairs together, and their words floated up to my ears before I could make my presence known by so much as a cough.</p><p>&quot;Then you must find a way,&quot; the doctor was saying with decision; &quot;for I cannot insist too strongly upon that--and at all costs she must be kept quiet. These attempts to go out must be prevented--if necessary, by force. This desire to visit some wood or other she keeps talking about is, of course, hysterical in nature. It cannot be permitted for a moment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It shall not be permitted,&quot; I heard the soldier reply, as they reached the hall below.</p><p>&quot;It has impressed her mind for some reason--&quot; the doctor went on, by way evidently of soothing explanation, and then the distance made it impossible for me to hear more.</p><p>At dinner Dr. Silence was still absent, on the public plea of a headache, and though food was sent to his room, I am inclined to believe he did not touch it, but spent the entire time fasting.</p><p>We retired early, desiring that the household should do likewise, and I must confess that at ten o&#39;clock when I bid my host a temporary good-night, and sought my room to make what mental preparation I could, I realised in no very pleasant fashion that it was a singular and formidable assignation, this midnight meeting in the laundry building, and that there were moments in every adventure of life when a wise man, and one who knew his own limitations, owed it to his dignity to withdraw discreetly. And, but for the character of our leader, I probably should have then and there offered the best excuse I could think of, and have allowed myself quietly to fall asleep and wait for an exciting story in the morning of what had happened. But with a man like John Silence, such a lapse was out of the question, and I sat before my fire counting the minutes and doing everything I could think of to fortify my resolution and fasten my will at the point where I could be reasonably sure that my self-control would hold against all attacks of men, devils, or elementals.</p><p>III</p><p>At a quarter before midnight, clad in a heavy ulster, and with slippered feet, I crept cautiously from my room and stole down the passage to the top of the stairs. Outside the doctor&#39;s door I waited a moment to listen. All was still; the house in utter darkness; no gleam of light beneath any door; only, down the length of the corridor, from the direction of the sick-room, came faint sounds of laughter and incoherent talk that were not things to reassure a mind already half a-tremble, and I made haste to reach the hall and let myself out through the front door into the night.</p><p>The air was keen and frosty, perfumed with night smells, and exquisitely fresh; all the million candles of the sky were alight, and a faint breeze rose and fell with far-away sighings in the tops of the pine trees. My blood leaped for a moment in the spaciousness of the night, for the splendid stars brought courage; but the next instant, as I turned the corner of the house, moving stealthily down the gravel drive, my spirits sank again ominously. For, yonder, over the funereal plumes of the Twelve Acre Plantation, I saw the broken, yellow disc of the half-moon just rising in the east, staring down like some vast Being come to watch upon the progress of our doom. Seen through the distorting vapours of the earth&#39;s atmosphere, her face looked weirdly unfamiliar, her usual expression of benignant vacancy somehow a-twist. I slipped along by the shadows of the wall, keeping my eyes upon the ground.</p><p>The laundry-house, as already described, stood detached from the other offices, with laurel shrubberies crowding thickly behind it, and the kitchen-garden so close on the other side that the strong smells of soil and growing things came across almost heavily. The shadows of the haunted plantation, hugely lengthened by the rising moon behind them, reached to the very walls and covered the stone tiles of the roof with a dark pall. So keenly were my senses alert at this moment that I believe I could fill a chapter with the endless small details of the impression I received--shadows, odour, shapes, sounds--in the space of the few seconds I stood and waited before the closed wooden door.</p><p>Then I became aware of some one moving towards me through the moonlight, and the figure of John Silence, without overcoat and bareheaded, came quickly and without noise to join me. His eyes, I saw at once, were wonderfully bright, and so marked was the shining pallor of his face that I could hardly tell when he passed from the moonlight into the shade.</p><p>He passed without a word, beckoning me to follow, and then pushed the door open, and went in.</p><p>The chill air of the place met us like that of an underground vault; and the brick floor and whitewashed walls, streaked with damp and smoke, threw back the cold in our faces. Directly opposite gaped the black throat of the huge open fireplace, the ashes of wood fires still piled and scattered about the hearth, and on either side of the projecting chimney-column were the deep recesses holding the big twin cauldrons for boiling clothes. Upon the lids of these cauldrons stood the two little oil lamps, shaded red, which gave all the light there was, and immediately in front of the fireplace there was a small circular table with three chairs set about it. Overhead, the narrow slit windows, high up the walls, pointed to a dim network of wooden rafters half lost among the shadows, and then came the dark vault of the roof. Cheerless and unalluring, for all the red light, it certainly was, reminding me of some unused conventicle, bare of pews or pulpit, ugly and severe, and I was forcibly struck by the contrast between the normal uses to which the place was ordinarily put, and the strange and medieval purpose which had brought us under its roof tonight.</p><p>Possibly an involuntary shudder ran over me, for my companion turned with a confident look to reassure me, and he was so completely master of himself that I at once absorbed from his abundance, and felt the chinks of my failing courage beginning to close up. To meet his eye in the presence of danger was like finding a mental railing that guided and supported thought along the giddy edges of alarm.</p><p>&quot;I am quite ready,&quot; I whispered, turning to listen for approaching footsteps.</p><p>He nodded, still keeping his eyes on mine. Our whispers sounded hollow as they echoed overhead among the rafters.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m glad you are here,&quot; he said. &quot;Not all would have the courage. Keep your thoughts controlled, and imagine the protective shell round you--round your inner being.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; I repeated, cursing my chattering teeth.</p><p>He took my hand and shook it, and the contact seemed to shake into me something of his supreme confidence. The eyes and hands of a strong man can touch the soul. I think he guessed my thought, for a passing smile flashed about the corners of his mouth.</p><p>&quot;You will feel more comfortable,&quot; he said, in a low tone, &quot;when the chain is complete. The Colonel we can count on, of course. Remember, though,&quot; he added warningly, &quot;he may perhaps become controlled--possessed--when the thing comes, because he won&#39;t know how to resist. And to explain the business to such a man--!&quot; He shrugged his shoulders expressively. &quot;But it will only be temporary, and I will see that no harm comes to him.&quot;</p><p>He glanced round at the arrangements with approval.</p><p>&quot;Red light,&quot; he said, indicating the shaded lamps, &quot;has the lowest rate of vibration. Materialisations are dissipated by strong light--won&#39;t form, or hold together--in rapid vibrations.&quot;</p><p>I was not sure that I approved altogether of this dim light, for in complete darkness there is something protective--the knowledge that one cannot be seen, probably--which a half-light destroys, but I remembered the warning to keep my thoughts steady, and forbore to give them expression.</p><p>There was a step outside, and the figure of Colonel Wragge stood in the doorway. Though entering on tiptoe, he made considerable noise and clatter, for his free movements were impeded by the burden he carried, and we saw a large yellowish bowl held out at arms&#39; length from his body, the mouth covered with a white cloth. His face, I noted, was rigidly composed. He, too, was master of himself. And, as I thought of this old soldier moving through the long series of alarms, worn with watching and wearied with assault, unenlightened yet undismayed, even down to the dreadful shock of his sister&#39;s terror, and still showing the dogged pluck that persists in the face of defeat, I understood what Dr. Silence meant when he described him as a man &quot;to be counted on.&quot;</p><p>I think there was nothing beyond this rigidity of his stern features, and a certain greyness of the complexion, to betray the turmoil of the emotions that were doubtless going on within; and the quality of these two men, each in his own way, so keyed me up that, by the time the door was shut and we had exchanged silent greetings, all the latent courage I possessed was well to the fore, and I felt as sure of myself as I knew I ever could feel.</p><p>Colonel Wragge set the bowl carefully in the centre of the table.</p><p>&quot;Midnight,&quot; he said shortly, glancing at his watch, and we all three moved to our chairs.</p><p>There, in the middle of that cold and silent place, we sat, with the vile bowl before us, and a thin, hardly perceptible steam rising through the damp air from the surface of the white cloth and disappearing upwards the moment it passed beyond the zone of red light and entered the deep shadows thrown forward by the projecting wall of chimney.</p><p>The doctor had indicated our respective places, and I found myself seated with my back to the door and opposite the black hearth. The Colonel was on my left, and Dr. Silence on my right, both half facing me, the latter more in shadow than the former. We thus divided the little table into even sections, and sitting back in our chairs we awaited events in silence.</p><p>For something like an hour I do not think there was even the faintest sound within those four walls and under the canopy of that vaulted roof. Our slippers made no scratching on the gritty floor, and our breathing was suppressed almost to nothing; even the rustle of our clothes as we shifted from time to time upon our seats was inaudible. Silence smothered us absolutely--the silence of night, of listening, the silence of a haunted expectancy. The very gurgling of the lamps was too soft to be heard, and if light itself had sound, I do not think we should have noticed the silvery tread of the moonlight as it entered the high narrow windows and threw upon the floor the slender traces of its pallid footsteps.</p><p>Colonel Wragge and the doctor, and myself too for that matter, sat thus like figures of stone, without speech and without gesture. My eyes passed in ceaseless journeys from the bowl to their faces, and from their faces to the bowl. They might have been masks, however, for all the signs of life they gave; and the light steaming from the horrid contents beneath the white cloth had long ceased to be visible.</p><p>Then presently, as the moon rose higher, the wind rose with it. It sighed, like the lightest of passing wings, over the roof; it crept most softly round the walls; it made the brick floor like ice beneath our feet. With it I saw mentally the desolate moorland flowing like a sea about the old house, the treeless expanse of lonely hills, the nearer copses, sombre and mysterious in the night. The plantation, too, in particular I saw, and imagined I heard the mournful whisperings that must now be a-stirring among its tree-tops as the breeze played down between the twisted stems. In the depth of the room behind us the shafts of moonlight met and crossed in a growing network.</p><p>It was after an hour of this wearing and unbroken attention, and I should judge about one o&#39;clock in the morning, when the baying of the dogs in the stableyard first began, and I saw John Silence move suddenly in his chair and sit up in an attitude of attention. Every force in my being instantly leaped into the keenest vigilance. Colonel Wragge moved too, though slowly, and without raising his eyes from the table before him.</p><p>The doctor stretched his arm out and took the white cloth from the bowl.</p><p>It was perhaps imagination that persuaded me the red glare of the lamps grew fainter and the air over the table before us thickened. I had been expecting something for so long that the movement of my companions, and the lifting of the cloth, may easily have caused the momentary delusion that something hovered in the air before my face, touching the skin of my cheeks with a silken run. But it was certainly not a delusion that the Colonel looked up at the same moment and glanced over his shoulder, as though his eyes followed the movements of something to and fro about the room, and that he then buttoned his overcoat more tightly about him and his eyes sought my own face first, and then the doctor&#39;s. And it was no delusion that his face seemed somehow to have turned dark, become spread as it were with a shadowy blackness. I saw his lips tighten and his expression grow hard and stern, and it came to me then with a rush that, of course, this man had told us but a part of the experiences he had been through in the house, and that there was much more he had never been able to bring himself to reveal at all. I felt sure of it. The way he turned and stared about him betrayed a familiarity with other things than those he had described to us. It was not merely a sight of fire he looked for; it was a sight of something alive, intelligent, something able to evade his searching; it was <em>a person</em>. It was the watch for the ancient Being who sought to obsess him.</p><p>And the way in which Dr. Silence answered his look--though it was only by a glance of subtlest sympathy--confirmed my impression.</p><p>&quot;We may be ready now,&quot; I heard him say in a whisper, and I understood that his words were intended as a steadying warning, and braced myself mentally to the utmost of my power.</p><p>Yet long before Colonel Wragge had turned to stare about the room, and long before the doctor had confirmed my impression that things were at last beginning to stir, I had become aware in most singular fashion that the place held more than our three selves. With the rising of the wind this increase to our numbers had first taken place. The baying of the hounds almost seemed to have signalled it. I cannot say how it may be possible to realise that an empty place has suddenly become--not empty, when the new arrival is nothing that appeals to any one of the senses; for this recognition of an &quot;invisible,&quot; as of the change in the balance of personal forces in a human group, is indefinable and beyond proof. Yet it is unmistakable. And I knew perfectly well at what given moment the atmosphere within these four walls became charged with the presence of other living beings besides ourselves. And, on reflection, I am convinced that both my companions knew it too.</p><p>&quot;Watch the light,&quot; said the doctor under his breath, and then I knew too that it was no fancy of my own that had turned the air darker, and the way he turned to examine the face of our host sent an electric thrill of wonder and expectancy shivering along every nerve in my body.</p><p>Yet it was no kind of terror that I experienced, but rather a sort of mental dizziness, and a sensation as of being suspended in some remote and dreadful altitude where things might happen, indeed were about to happen, that had never before happened within the ken of man. Horror may have formed an ingredient, but it was not chiefly horror, and in no sense ghostly horror.</p><p>Uncommon thoughts kept beating on my brain like tiny hammers, soft yet persistent, seeking admission; their unbidden tide began to wash along the far fringes of my mind, the currents of unwonted sensations to rise over the remote frontiers of my consciousness. I was aware of thoughts, and the fantasies of thoughts, that I never knew before existed. Portions of my being stirred that had never stirred before, and things ancient and inexplicable rose to the surface and beckoned me to follow. I felt as though I were about to fly off, at some immense tangent, into an outer space hitherto unknown even in dreams. And so singular was the result produced upon me that I was uncommonly glad to anchor my mind, as well as my eyes, upon the masterful personality of the doctor at my side, for there, I realised, I could draw always upon the forces of sanity and safety.</p><p>With a vigorous effort of will I returned to the scene before me, and tried to focus my attention, with steadier thoughts, upon the table, and upon the silent figures seated round it. And then I saw that certain changes had come about in the place where we sat.</p><p>The patches of moonlight on the floor, I noted, had become curiously shaded; the faces of my companions opposite were not so clearly visible as before; and the forehead and cheeks of Colonel Wragge were glistening with perspiration. I realised further, that an extraordinary change had come about in the temperature of the atmosphere. The increased warmth had a painful effect, not alone on Colonel Wragge, but upon all of us. It was oppressive and unnatural. We gasped figuratively as well as actually.</p><p>&quot;You are the first to feel it,&quot; said Dr. Silence in low tones, looking across at him. &quot;You are in more intimate touch, of course--&quot;</p><p>The Colonel was trembling, and appeared to be in considerable distress. His knees shook, so that the shuffling of his slippered feet became audible. He inclined his head to show that he had heard, but made no other reply. I think, even then, he was sore put to it to keep himself in hand. I knew what he was struggling against. As Dr. Silence had warned me, he was about to be obsessed, and was savagely, though vainly, resisting.</p><p>But, meanwhile, a curious and whirling sense of exhilaration began to come over me. The increasing heat was delightful, bringing a sensation of intense activity, of thoughts pouring through the mind at high speed, of vivid pictures in the brain, of fierce desires and lightning energies alive in every part of the body. I was conscious of no physical distress, such as the Colonel felt, but only of a vague feeling that it might all grow suddenly too intense--that I might be consumed--that my personality as well as my body, might become resolved into the flame of pure spirit. I began to live at a speed too intense to last. It was as if a thousand ecstasies besieged me--</p><p>&quot;Steady!&quot; whispered the voice of John Silence in my ear, and I looked up with a start to see that the Colonel had risen from his chair. The doctor rose too. I followed suit, and for the first time saw down into the bowl. To my amazement and horror I saw that the contents were troubled. The blood was astir with movement.</p><p>The rest of the experiment was witnessed by us standing. It came, too, with a curious suddenness. There was no more dreaming, for me at any rate.</p><p>I shall never forget the figure of Colonel Wragge standing there beside me, upright and unshaken, squarely planted on his feet, looking about him, puzzled beyond belief, yet full of a fighting anger. Framed by the white walls, the red glow of the lamps upon his streaming cheeks, his eyes glowing against the deathly pallor of his skin, breathing hard and making convulsive efforts of hands and body to keep himself under control, his whole being roused to the point of savage fighting, yet with nothing visible to get at anywhere--he stood there, immovable against odds. And the strange contrast of the pale skin and the burning face I had never seen before, or wish to see again.</p><p>But what has left an even sharper impression on my memory was the blackness that then began crawling over his face, obliterating the features, concealing their human outline, and hiding him inch by inch from view. This was my first realisation that the process of materialisation was at work. His visage became shrouded. I moved from one side to the other to keep him in view, and it was only then I understood that, properly speaking, the blackness was not upon the countenance of Colonel Wragge, but that something had inserted itself between me and him, thus screening his face with the effect of a dark veil. Something that apparently rose through the floor was passing slowly into the air above the table and above the bowl. The blood in the bowl, moreover, was considerably less than before.</p><p>And, with this change in the air before us, there came at the same time a further change, I thought, in the face of the soldier. One-half was turned towards the red lamps, while the other caught the pale illumination of the moonlight falling aslant from the high windows, so that it was difficult to estimate this change with accuracy of detail. But it seemed to me that, while the features--eyes, nose, mouth--remained the same, the life informing them had undergone some profound transformation. The signature of a new power had crept into the face and left its traces there--an expression dark, and in some unexplained way, terrible.</p><p>Then suddenly he opened his mouth and spoke, and the sound of this changed voice, deep and musical though it was, made me cold and set my heart beating with uncomfortable rapidity. The Being, as he had dreaded, was already in control of his brain, using his mouth.</p><p>&quot;I see a blackness like the blackness of Egypt before my face,&quot; said the tones of this unknown voice that seemed half his own and half another&#39;s. &quot;And out of this darkness they come, they come.&quot;</p><p>I gave a dreadful start. The doctor turned to look at me for an instant, and then turned to centre his attention upon the figure of our host, and I understood in some intuitive fashion that he was there to watch over the strangest contest man ever saw--to watch over and, if necessary, to protect.</p><p>&quot;He is being controlled--possessed,&quot; he whispered to me through the shadows. His face wore a wonderful expression, half triumph, half admiration.</p><p>Even as Colonel Wragge spoke, it seemed to me that this visible darkness began to increase, pouring up thickly out of the ground by the hearth, rising up in sheets and veils, shrouding our eyes and faces. It stole up from below--an awful blackness that seemed to drink in all the radiations of light in the building, leaving nothing but the ghost of a radiance in their place. Then, out of this rising sea of shadows, issued a pale and spectral light that gradually spread itself about us, and from the heart of this light I saw the shapes of fire crowd and gather. And these were not human shapes, or the shapes of anything I recognised as alive in the world, but outlines of fire that traced globes, triangles, crosses, and the luminous bodies of various geometrical figures. They grew bright, faded, and then grew bright again with an effect almost of pulsation. They passed swiftly to and fro through the air, rising and falling, and particularly in the immediate neighbourhood of the Colonel, often gathering about his head and shoulders, and even appearing to settle upon him like giant insects of flame. They were accompanied, moreover, by a faint sound of hissing--the same sound we had heard that afternoon in the plantation.</p><p>&quot;The fire-elementals that precede their master,&quot; the doctor said in an undertone. &quot;Be ready.&quot;</p><p>And while this weird display of the shapes of fire alternately flashed and faded, and the hissing echoed faintly among the dim rafters overhead, we heard the awful voice issue at intervals from the lips of the afflicted soldier. It was a voice of power, splendid in some way I cannot describe, and with a certain sense of majesty in its cadences, and, as I listened to it with quickly beating heart, I could fancy it was some ancient voice of Time itself, echoing down immense corridors of stone, from the depths of vast temples, from the very heart of mountain tombs.</p><p>&quot;I have seen my divine Father, Osiris,&quot; thundered the great tones. &quot;I have scattered the gloom of the night. I have burst through the earth, and am one with the starry Deities!&quot;</p><p>Something grand came into the soldier&#39;s face. He was staring fixedly before him, as though seeing nothing.</p><p>&quot;Watch,&quot; whispered Dr. Silence in my ear, and his whisper seemed to come from very far away.</p><p>Again the mouth opened and the awesome voice issued forth.</p><p>&quot;Thoth,&quot; it boomed, &quot;has loosened the bandages of Set which fettered my mouth. I have taken my place in the great winds of heaven.&quot;</p><p>I heard the little wind of night, with its mournful voice of ages, sighing round the walls and over the roof.</p><p>&quot;Listen!&quot; came from the doctor at my side, and the thunder of the voice continued--</p><p>&quot;I have hidden myself with you, O ye stars that never diminish. I remember my name--in--the--House--of--Fire!&quot;</p><p>The voice ceased and the sound died away. Something about the face and figure of Colonel Wragge relaxed, I thought. The terrible look passed from his face. The Being that obsessed him was gone.</p><p>&quot;The great Ritual,&quot; said Dr. Silence aside to me, very low, &quot;the Book of the Dead. Now it&#39;s leaving him. Soon the blood will fashion it a body.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge, who had stood absolutely motionless all this time, suddenly swayed, so that I thought he was going to fall,--and, but for the quick support of the doctor&#39;s arm, he probably would have fallen, for he staggered as in the beginning of collapse.</p><p>&quot;I am drunk with the wine of Osiris,&quot; he cried,--and it was half with his own voice this time--&quot;but Horus, the Eternal Watcher, is about my path--for--safety.&quot; The voice dwindled and failed, dying away into something almost like a cry of distress.</p><p>&quot;Now, watch closely,&quot; said Dr. Silence, speaking loud, &quot;for after the cry will come the Fire!&quot;</p><p>I began to tremble involuntarily; an awful change had come without warning into the air; my legs grew weak as paper beneath my weight and I had to support myself by leaning on the table. Colonel Wragge, I saw, was also leaning forward with a kind of droop. The shapes of fire had vanished all, but his face was lit by the red lamps and the pale, shifting moonlight rose behind him like mist.</p><p>We were both gazing at the bowl, now almost empty; the Colonel stooped so low I feared every minute he would lose his balance and drop into it; and the shadow, that had so long been in process of forming, now at length began to assume material outline in the air before us.</p><p>Then John Silence moved forward quickly. He took his place between us and the shadow. Erect, formidable, absolute master of the situation, I saw him stand there, his face calm and almost smiling, and fire in his eyes. His protective influence was astounding and incalculable. Even the abhorrent dread I felt at the sight of the creature growing into life and substance before us, lessened in some way so that I was able to keep my eyes fixed on the air above the bowl without too vivid a terror.</p><p>But as it took shape, rising out of nothing as it were, and growing momentarily more defined in outline, a period of utter and wonderful silence settled down upon the building and all it contained. A hush of ages, like the sudden centre of peace at the heart of the travelling cyclone, descended through the night, and out of this hush, as out of the emanations of the steaming blood, issued the form of the ancient being who had first sent the elemental of fire upon its mission. It grew and darkened and solidified before our eyes. It rose from just beyond the table so that the lower portions remained invisible, but I saw the outline limn itself upon the air, as though slowly revealed by the rising of a curtain. It apparently had not then quite concentrated to the normal proportions, but was spread out on all sides into space, huge, though rapidly condensing, for I saw the colossal shoulders, the neck, the lower portion of the dark jaws, the terrible mouth, and then the teeth and lips--and, as the veil seemed to lift further upon the tremendous face--I saw the nose and cheek bones. In another moment I should have looked straight into the eyes--</p><p>But what Dr. Silence did at that moment was so unexpected, and took me so by surprise, that I have never yet properly understood its nature, and he has never yet seen fit to explain in detail to me. He uttered some sound that had a note of command in it--and, in so doing, stepped forward and intervened between me and the face. The figure, just nearing completeness, he therefore hid from my sight--and I have always thought purposely hid from my sight.</p><p>&quot;The fire!&quot; he cried out. &quot;The fire! Beware!&quot;</p><p>There was a sudden roar as of flame from the very mouth of the pit, and for the space of a single second all grew light as day. A blinding flash passed across my face, and there was heat for an instant that seemed to shrivel skin, and flesh, and bone. Then came steps, and I heard Colonel Wragge utter a great cry, wilder than any human cry I have ever known. The heat sucked all the breath out of my lungs with a rush, and the blaze of light, as it vanished, swept my vision with it into enveloping darkness.</p><p>When I recovered the use of my senses a few moments later I saw that Colonel Wragge with a face of death, its whiteness strangely stained, had moved closer to me. Dr. Silence stood beside him, an expression of triumph and success in his eyes. The next minute the soldier tried to clutch me with his hand. Then he reeled, staggered, and, unable to save himself, fell with a great crash upon the brick floor.</p><p>After the sheet of flame, a wind raged round the building as though it would lift the roof off, but then passed as suddenly as it came. And in the intense calm that followed I saw that the form had vanished, and the doctor was stooping over Colonel Wragge upon the floor, trying to lift him to a sitting position.</p><p>&quot;Light,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;more light. Take the shades off.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge sat up and the glare of the unshaded lamps fell upon his face. It was grey and drawn, still running heat, and there was a look in the eyes and about the corners of the mouth that seemed in this short space of time to have added years to its age. At the same time, the expression of effort and anxiety had left it. It showed relief.</p><p>&quot;Gone!&quot; he said, looking up at the doctor in a dazed fashion, and struggling to his feet. &quot;Thank God! it&#39;s gone at last.&quot; He stared round the laundry as though to find out where he was. &quot;Did it control me--take possession of me? Did I talk nonsense?&quot; he asked bluntly. &quot;After the heat came, I remember nothing--&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;ll feel yourself again in a few minutes,&quot; the doctor said. To my infinite horror I saw that he was surreptitiously wiping sundry dark stains from the face. &quot;Our experiment has been a success and--&quot;</p><p>He gave me a swift glance to hide the bowl, standing between me and our host while I hurriedly stuffed it down under the lid of the nearest cauldron.</p><p>&quot;--and none of us the worse for it,&quot; he finished.</p><p>&quot;And fires?&quot; he asked, still dazed, &quot;there&#39;ll be no more fires?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is dissipated--partly, at any rate,&quot; replied Dr. Silence cautiously.</p><p>&quot;And the man behind the gun,&quot; he went on, only half realising what he was saying, I think; &quot;have you discovered <em>that?</em>&quot;</p><p>&quot;A form materialised,&quot; said the doctor briefly. &quot;I know for certain now what the directing intelligence was behind it all.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge pulled himself together and got upon his feet. The words conveyed no clear meaning to him yet. But his memory was returning gradually, and he was trying to piece together the fragments into a connected whole. He shivered a little, for the place had grown suddenly chilly. The air was empty again, lifeless.</p><p>&quot;You feel all right again now,&quot; Dr. Silence said, in the tone of a man stating a fact rather than asking a question.</p><p>&quot;Thanks to you--both, yes.&quot; He drew a deep breath, and mopped his face, and even attempted a smile. He made me think of a man coming from the battlefield with the stains of fighting still upon him, but scornful of his wounds. Then he turned gravely towards the doctor with a question in his eyes. Memory had returned and he was himself again.</p><p>&quot;Precisely what I expected,&quot; the doctor said calmly; &quot;a fire-elemental sent upon its mission in the days of Thebes, centuries before Christ, and tonight, for the first time all these thousands of years, released from the spell that originally bound it.&quot;</p><p>We stared at him in amazement, Colonel Wragge opening his lips for words that refused to shape themselves.</p><p>&quot;And, if we dig,&quot; he continued significantly, pointing to the floor where the blackness had poured up, &quot;we shall find some underground connection--a tunnel most likely--leading to the Twelve Acre Wood. It was made by--your predecessor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A tunnel made by my brother!&quot; gasped the soldier. &quot;Then my sister should know--she lived here with him--&quot; He stopped suddenly.</p><p>John Silence inclined his head slowly. &quot;I think so,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Your brother, no doubt, was as much tormented as you have been,&quot; he continued after a pause in which Colonel Wragge seemed deeply preoccupied with his thoughts, &quot;and tried to find peace by burying it in the wood, and surrounding the wood then, like a large magic circle, with the enchantments of the old formulae. So the stars the man saw blazing--&quot;</p><p>&quot;But burying what?&quot; asked the soldier faintly, stepping backwards towards the support of the wall.</p><p>Dr. Silence regarded us both intently for a moment before he replied. I think he weighed in his mind whether to tell us now, or when the investigation was absolutely complete.</p><p>&quot;The mummy,&quot; he said softly, after a moment; &quot;the mummy that your brother took from its resting place of centuries, and brought home--here.&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge dropped down upon the nearest chair, hanging breathlessly on every word. He was far too amazed for speech.</p><p>&quot;The mummy of some important person--a priest most likely--protected from disturbance and desecration by the ceremonial magic of the time. For they understood how to attach to the mummy, to lock up with it in the tomb, an elemental force that would direct itself even after ages upon any one who dared to molest it. In this case it was an elemental of fire.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence crossed the floor and turned out the lamps one by one. He had nothing more to say for the moment. Following his example, I folded the table together and took up the chairs, and our host, still dazed and silent, mechanically obeyed him and moved to the door.</p><p>We removed all traces of the experiment, taking the empty bowl back to the house concealed beneath an ulster.</p><p>The air was cool and fragrant as we walked to the house, the stars beginning to fade overhead and a fresh wind of early morning blowing up out of the east where the sky was already hinting of the coming day. It was after five o&#39;clock.</p><p>Stealthily we entered the front hall and locked the door, and as we went on tiptoe upstairs to our rooms, the Colonel, peering at us over his candle as he nodded good-night, whispered that if we were ready the digging should be begun that very day.</p><p>Then I saw him steal along to his sister&#39;s room and disappear.</p><p>IV</p><p>But not even the mysterious references to the mummy, or the prospect of a revelation by digging, were able to hinder the reaction that followed the intense excitement of the past twelve hours, and I slept the sleep of the dead, dreamless and undisturbed. A touch on the shoulder woke me, and I saw Dr. Silence standing beside the bed, dressed to go out.</p><p>&quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#39;s tea-time. You&#39;ve slept the best part of a dozen hours.&quot;</p><p>I sprang up and made a hurried toilet, while my companion sat and talked. He looked fresh and rested, and his manner was even quieter than usual.</p><p>&quot;Colonel Wragge has provided spades and pickaxes. We&#39;re going out to unearth this mummy at once,&quot; he said; &quot;and there&#39;s no reason we should not get away by the morning train.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m ready to go tonight, if you are,&quot; I said honestly.</p><p>But Dr. Silence shook his head.</p><p>&quot;I must see this through to the end,&quot; he said gravely, and in a tone that made me think he still anticipated serious things, perhaps. He went on talking while I dressed.</p><p>&quot;This case is really typical of all stories of mummy-haunting, and none of them are cases to trifle with,&quot; he explained, &quot;for the mummies of important people--kings, priests, magicians--were laid away with profoundly significant ceremonial, and were very effectively protected, as you have seen, against desecration, and especially against destruction.</p><p>&quot;The general belief,&quot; he went on, anticipating my questions, &quot;held, of course, that the perpetuity of the mummy guaranteed that of its Ka,--the owner&#39;s spirit,--but it is not improbable that the magical embalming was also used to retard reincarnation, the preservation of the body preventing the return of the spirit to the toil and discipline of earth-life; and, in any case, they knew how to attach powerful guardian-forces to keep off trespassers. And any one who dared to remove the mummy, or especially to unwind it--well,&quot; he added, with meaning, &quot;you have seen--and you will see.&quot;</p><p>I caught his face in the mirror while I struggled with my collar. It was deeply serious. There could be no question that he spoke of what he believed and knew.</p><p>&quot;The traveller-brother who brought it here must have been haunted too,&quot; he continued, &quot;for he tried to banish it by burial in the wood, making a magic circle to enclose it. Something of genuine ceremonial he must have known, for the stars the man saw were of course the remains of the still flaming pentagrams he traced at intervals in the circle. Only he did not know enough, or possibly was ignorant that the mummy&#39;s guardian was a fire-force. Fire cannot be enclosed by fire, though, as you saw, it can be released by it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then that awful figure in the laundry?&quot; I asked, thrilled to find him so communicative.</p><p>&quot;Undoubtedly the actual Ka of the mummy operating always behind its agent, the elemental, and most likely thousands of years old.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And Miss Wragge--?&quot; I ventured once more.</p><p>&quot;Ah, Miss Wragge,&quot; he repeated with increased gravity, &quot;Miss Wragge--&quot;</p><p>A knock at the door brought a servant with word that tea was ready, and the Colonel had sent to ask if we were coming down. The thread was broken. Dr. Silence moved to the door and signed to me to follow. But his manner told me that in any case no real answer would have been forthcoming to my question.</p><p>&quot;And the place to dig in,&quot; I asked, unable to restrain my curiosity, &quot;will you find it by some process of divination or--?&quot;</p><p>He paused at the door and looked back at me, and with that he left me to finish my dressing.</p><p>It was growing dark when the three of us silently made our way to the Twelve Acre Plantation; the sky was overcast, and a black wind came out of the east. Gloom hung about the old house and the air seemed full of sighings. We found the tools ready laid at the edge of the wood, and each shouldering his piece, we followed our leader at once in among the trees. He went straight forward for some twenty yards and then stopped. At his feet lay the blackened circle of one of the burned places. It was just discernible against the surrounding white grass.</p><p>&quot;There are three of these,&quot; he said, &quot;and they all lie in a line with one another. Any one of them will tap the tunnel that connects the laundry--the former Museum--with the chamber where the mummy now lies buried.&quot;</p><p>He at once cleared away the burnt grass and began to dig; we all began to dig. While I used the pick, the others shovelled vigorously. No one spoke. Colonel Wragge worked the hardest of the three. The soil was light and sandy, and there were only a few snake-like roots and occasional loose stones to delay us. The pick made short work of these. And meanwhile the darkness settled about us and the biting wind swept roaring through the trees overhead.</p><p>Then, quite suddenly, without a cry, Colonel Wragge disappeared up to his neck.</p><p>&quot;The tunnel!&quot; cried the doctor, helping to drag him out, red, breathless, and covered with sand and perspiration. &quot;Now, let me lead the way.&quot; And he slipped down nimbly into the hole, so that a moment later we heard his voice, muffled by sand and distance, rising up to us.</p><p>&quot;Hubbard, you come next, and then Colonel Wragge--if he wishes,&quot; we heard.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll follow you, of course,&quot; he said, looking at me as I scrambled in.</p><p>The hole was bigger now, and I got down on all-fours in a channel not much bigger than a large sewer-pipe and found myself in total darkness. A minute later a heavy thud, followed by a cataract of loose sand, announced the arrival of the Colonel.</p><p>&quot;Catch hold of my heel,&quot; called Dr. Silence, &quot;and Colonel Wragge can take yours.&quot;</p><p>In this slow, laborious fashion we wormed our way along a tunnel that had been roughly dug out of the shifting sand, and was shored up clumsily by means of wooden pillars and posts. Any moment, it seemed to me, we might be buried alive. We could not see an inch before our eyes, but had to grope our way feeling the pillars and the walls. It was difficult to breathe, and the Colonel behind me made but slow progress, for the cramped position of our bodies was very severe.</p><p>We had travelled in this way for ten minutes, and gone perhaps as much as ten yards, when I lost my grasp of the doctor&#39;s heel.</p><p>&quot;Ah!&quot; I heard his voice, sounding above me somewhere. He was standing up in a clear space, and the next moment I was standing beside him. Colonel Wragge came heavily after, and he too rose up and stood. Then Dr. Silence produced his candles and we heard preparations for striking matches.</p><p>Yet even before there was light, an indefinable sensation of awe came over us all. In this hole in the sand, some three feet under ground, we stood side by side, cramped and huddled, struck suddenly with an over whelming apprehension of something ancient, something formidable, something incalculably wonderful, that touched in each one of us a sense of the sublime and the terrible even before we could see an inch before our faces. I know not how to express in language this singular emotion that caught us here in utter darkness, touching no sense directly, it seemed, yet with the recognition that before us in the blackness of this underground night there lay something that was mighty with the mightiness of long past ages.</p><p>I felt Colonel Wragge press in closely to my side, and I understood the pressure and welcomed it. No human touch, to me at least, has ever been more eloquent.</p><p>Then the match flared, a thousand shadows fled on black wings, and I saw John Silence fumbling with the candle, his face lit up grotesquely by the flickering light below it.</p><p>I had dreaded this light, yet when it came there was apparently nothing to explain the profound sensations of dread that preceded it. We stood in a small vaulted chamber in the sand, the sides and roof shored with bars of wood, and the ground laid roughly with what seemed to be tiles. It was six feet high, so that we could all stand comfortably, and may have been ten feet long by eight feet wide. Upon the wooden pillars at the side I saw that Egyptian hieroglyphics had been rudely traced by burning.</p><p>Dr. Silence lit three candles and handed one to each of us. He placed a fourth in the sand against the wall on his right, and another to mark the entrance to the tunnel. We stood and stared about us, instinctively holding our breath.</p><p>&quot;Empty, by God!&quot; exclaimed Colonel Wragge. His voice trembled with excitement. And then, as his eyes rested on the ground, he added, &quot;And footsteps--look--footsteps in the sand!&quot;</p><p>Dr. Silence said nothing. He stooped down and began to make a search of the chamber, and as he moved, my eyes followed his crouching figure and noted the queer distorted shadows that poured over the walls and ceiling after him. Here and there thin trickles of loose sand ran fizzing down the sides. The atmosphere, heavily charged with faint yet pungent odours, lay utterly still, and the flames of the candles might have been painted on the air for all the movement they betrayed.</p><p>And, as I watched, it was almost necessary to persuade myself forcibly that I was only standing upright with difficulty in this little sand-hole of a modern garden in the south of England, for it seemed to me that I stood, as in vision, at the entrance of some vast rock-hewn Temple far, far down the river of Time. The illusion was powerful, and persisted. Granite columns, that rose to heaven, piled themselves about me, majestically uprearing, and a roof like the sky itself spread above a line of colossal figures that moved in shadowy procession along endless and stupendous aisles. This huge and splendid fantasy, borne I knew not whence, possessed me so vividly that I was actually obliged to concentrate my attention upon the small stooping figure of the doctor, as he groped about the walls, in order to keep the eye of imagination on the scene before me.</p><p>But the limited space rendered a long search out of the question, and his footsteps, instead of shuffling through loose sand, presently struck something of a different quality that gave forth a hollow and resounding echo. He stooped to examine more closely.</p><p>He was standing exactly in the centre of the little chamber when this happened, and he at once began scraping away the sand with his feet. In less than a minute a smooth surface became visible--the surface of a wooden covering. The next thing I saw was that he had raised it and was peering down into a space below. Instantly, a strong odour of nitre and bitumen, mingled with the strange perfume of unknown and powdered aromatics, rose up from the uncovered space and filled the vault, stinging the throat and making the eyes water and smart.</p><p>&quot;The mummy!&quot; whispered Dr. Silence, looking up into our faces over his candle; and as he said the word I felt the soldier lurch against me, and heard his breathing in my very ear.</p><p>&quot;The mummy!&quot; he repeated under his breath, as we pressed forward to look.</p><p>It is difficult to say exactly why the sight should have stirred in me so prodigious an emotion of wonder and veneration, for I have had not a little to do with mummies, have unwound scores of them, and even experimented magically with not a few. But there was something in the sight of that grey and silent figure, lying in its modern box of lead and wood at the bottom of this sandy grave, swathed in the bandages of centuries and wrapped in the perfumed linen that the priests of Egypt had prayed over with their mighty enchantments thousands of years before--something in the sight of it lying there and breathing its own spice-laden atmosphere even in the darkness of its exile in this remote land, something that pierced to the very core of my being and touched that root of awe which slumbers in every man near the birth of tears and the passion of true worship.</p><p>I remember turning quickly from the Colonel, lest he should see my emotion, yet fail to understand its cause, turn and clutch John Silence by the arm, and then fall trembling to see that he, too, had lowered his head and was hiding his face in his hands.</p><p>A kind of whirling storm came over me, rising out of I know not what utter deeps of memory, and in a whiteness of vision I heard the magical old chauntings from the Book of the Dead, and saw the Gods pass by in dim procession, the mighty, immemorial Beings who were yet themselves only the personified attributes of the true Gods, the God with the Eyes of Fire, the God with the Face of Smoke. I saw again Anubis, the dog-faced deity, and the children of Horus, eternal watcher of the ages, as they swathed Osiris, the first mummy of the world, in the scented and mystic bands, and I tasted again something of the ecstasy of the justified soul as it embarked in the golden Boat of Ra, and journeyed onwards to rest in the fields of the blessed.</p><p>And then, as Dr. Silence, with infinite reverence, stooped and touched the still face, so dreadfully staring with its painted eyes, there rose again to our nostrils wave upon wave of this perfume of thousands of years, and time fled backwards like a thing of naught, showing me in haunted panorama the most wonderful dream of the whole world.</p><p>A gentle hissing became audible in the air, and the doctor moved quickly backwards. It came close to our faces and then seemed to play about the walls and ceiling.</p><p>&quot;The last of the Fire--still waiting for its full accomplishment,&quot; he muttered; but I heard both words and hissing as things far away, for I was still busy with the journey of the soul through the Seven Halls of Death, listening for echoes of the grandest ritual ever known to men.</p><p>The earthen plates covered with hieroglyphics still lay beside the mummy, and round it, carefully arranged at the points of the compass, stood the four jars with the heads of the hawk, the jackal, the cynocephalus, and man, the jars in which were placed the hair, the nail parings, the heart, and other special portions of the body. Even the amulets, the mirror, the blue clay statues of the Ka, and the lamp with seven wicks were there. Only the sacred scarabaeus was missing.</p><p>&quot;Not only has it been torn from its ancient resting-place,&quot; I heard Dr. Silence saying in a solemn voice as he looked at Colonel Wragge with fixed gaze, &quot;but it has been partially unwound,&quot;--he pointed to the wrappings of the breast,--&quot;and--the scarabaeus has been removed from the throat.&quot;</p><p>The hissing, that was like the hissing of an invisible flame, had ceased; only from time to time we heard it as though it passed backwards and forwards in the tunnel; and we stood looking into each other&#39;s faces without speaking.</p><p>Presently Colonel Wragge made a great effort and braced himself. I heard the sound catch in his throat before the words actually became audible.</p><p>&quot;My sister,&quot; he said, very low. And then there followed a long pause, broken at length by John Silence.</p><p>&quot;It must be replaced,&quot; he said significantly.</p><p>&quot;I knew nothing,&quot; the soldier said, forcing himself to speak the words he hated saying. &quot;Absolutely nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It must be returned,&quot; repeated the other, &quot;if it is not now too late. For I fear--I fear--&quot;</p><p>Colonel Wragge made a movement of assent with his head.</p><p>&quot;It shall be,&quot; he said.</p><p>The place was still as the grave.</p><p>I do not know what it was then that made us all three turn round with so sudden a start, for there was no sound audible to my ears, at least.</p><p>The doctor was on the point of replacing the lid over the mummy, when he straightened up as if he had been shot.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s something coming,&quot; said Colonel Wragge under his breath, and the doctor&#39;s eyes, peering down the small opening of the tunnel, showed me the true direction.</p><p>A distant shuffling noise became distinctly audible coming from a point about half-way down the tunnel we had so laboriously penetrated.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s the sand falling in,&quot; I said, though I knew it was foolish.</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; said the Colonel calmly, in a voice that seemed to have the ring of iron, &quot;I&#39;ve heard it for some time past. It is something alive--and it is coming nearer.&quot;</p><p>He stared about him with a look of resolution that made his face almost noble. The horror in his heart was overmastering, yet he stood there prepared for anything that might come.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no other way out,&quot; John Silence said.</p><p>He leaned the lid against the sand, and waited. I knew by the masklike expression of his face, the pallor, and the steadiness of the eyes, that he anticipated something that might be very terrible--appalling.</p><p>The Colonel and myself stood on either side of the opening. I still held my candle and was ashamed of the way it shook, dripping the grease all over me; but the soldier had set his into the sand just behind his feet.</p><p>Thoughts of being buried alive, of being smothered like rats in a trap, of being caught and done to death by some invisible and merciless force we could not grapple with, rushed into my mind. Then I thought of fire--of suffocation--of being roasted alive. The perspiration began to pour from my face.</p><p>&quot;Steady!&quot; came the voice of Dr. Silence to me through the vault.</p><p>For five minutes, that seemed fifty, we stood waiting, looking from each other&#39;s faces to the mummy, and from the mummy to the hole, and all the time the shuffling sound, soft and stealthy, came gradually nearer. The tension, for me at least, was very near the breaking point when at last the cause of the disturbance reached the edge. It was hidden for a moment just behind the broken rim of soil. A jet of sand, shaken by the close vibration, trickled down on to the ground; I have never in my life seen anything fall with such laborious leisure. The next second, uttering a cry of curious quality, it came into view.</p><p>And it was far more distressingly horrible than anything I had anticipated.</p><p>For the sight of some Egyptian monster, some god of the tombs, or even of some demon of fire, I think I was already half prepared; but when, instead, I saw the white visage of Miss Wragge framed in that round opening of sand, followed by her body crawling on all fours, her eyes bulging and reflecting the yellow glare of the candles, my first instinct was to turn and run like a frantic animal seeking a way of escape.</p><p>But Dr. Silence, who seemed no whit surprised, caught my arm and steadied me, and we both saw the Colonel then drop upon his knees and come thus to a level with his sister. For more than a whole minute, as though struck in stone, the two faces gazed silently at each other: hers, for all the dreadful emotion in it, more like a gargoyle than anything human; and his, white and blank with an expression that was beyond either astonishment or alarm. She looked up; he looked down. It was a picture in a nightmare, and the candle, stuck in the sand close to the hole, threw upon it the glare of impromptu footlights.</p><p>Then John Silence moved forward and spoke in a voice that was very low, yet perfectly calm and natural.</p><p>&quot;I am glad you have come,&quot; he said. &quot;You are the one person whose presence at this moment is most required. And I hope that you may yet be in time to appease the anger of the Fire, and to bring peace again to your household, and,&quot; he added lower still so that no one heard it but myself, &quot;<em>safety to yourself</em>.&quot;</p><p>And while her brother stumbled backwards, crushing a candle into the sand in his awkwardness, the old lady crawled farther into the vaulted chamber and slowly rose upon her feet.</p><p>At the sight of the wrapped figure of the mummy I was fully prepared to see her scream and faint, but on the contrary, to my complete amazement, she merely bowed her head and dropped quietly upon her knees. Then, after a pause of more than a minute, she raised her eyes to the roof and her lips began to mutter as in prayer. Her right hand, meanwhile, which had been fumbling for some time at her throat suddenly came away, and before the gaze of all of us she held it out, palm upwards, over the grey and ancient figure outstretched below. And in it we beheld glistening the green jasper of the stolen scarabaeus.</p><p>Her brother, leaning heavily against the wall behind, uttered a sound that was half cry, half exclamation, but John Silence, standing directly in front of her, merely fixed his eyes on her and pointed downwards to the staring face below.</p><p>&quot;Replace it,&quot; he said sternly, &quot;where it belongs.&quot;</p><p>Miss Wragge was kneeling at the feet of the mummy when this happened. We three men all had our eyes riveted on what followed. Only the reader who by some remote chance may have witnessed a line of mummies, freshly laid from their tombs upon the sand, slowly stir and bend as the heat of the Egyptian sun warms their ancient bodies into the semblance of life, can form any conception of the ultimate horror we experienced when the silent figure before us moved in its grave of lead and sand. Slowly, before our eyes, it writhed, and, with a faint rustling of the immemorial cerements, rose up, and, through sightless and bandaged eyes, stared across the yellow candlelight at the woman who had violated it.</p><p>I tried to move--her brother tried to move--but the sand seemed to hold our feet. I tried to cry--her brother tried to cry--but the sand seemed to fill our lungs and throat. We could only stare--and, even so, the sand seemed to rise like a desert storm and cloud our vision ...</p><p>And when I managed at length to open my eyes again, the mummy was lying once more upon its back, motionless, the shrunken and painted face upturned towards the ceiling, and the old lady had tumbled forward and was lying in the semblance of death with her head and arms upon its crumbling body.</p><p>But upon the wrappings of the throat I saw the green jasper of the sacred scarabaeus shining again like a living eye.</p><p>Colonel Wragge and the doctor recovered themselves long before I did, and I found myself helping them clumsily and unintelligently to raise the frail body of the old lady, while John Silence carefully replaced the covering over the grave and scraped back the sand with his foot, while he issued brief directions.</p><p>I heard his voice as in a dream; but the journey back along that cramped tunnel, weighted by a dead woman, blinded with sand, suffocated with heat, was in no sense a dream. It took us the best part of half an hour to reach the open air. And, even then, we had to wait a considerable time for the appearance of Dr. Silence. We carried her undiscovered into the house and up to her own room.</p><p>&quot;The mummy will cause no further disturbance,&quot; I heard Dr. Silence say to our host later that evening as we prepared to drive for the night train, &quot;provided always,&quot; he added significantly, &quot;that you, and yours, cause it no disturbance.&quot;</p><p>It was in a dream, too, that we left.</p><p>&quot;You did not see her face, I know,&quot; he said to me as we wrapped our rugs about us in the empty compartment. And when I shook my head, quite unable to explain the instinct that had come to me not to look, he turned toward me, his face pale, and genuinely sad.</p><p>&quot;Scorched and blasted,&quot; he whispered.</p><p>End of # Three John Silence Stories, by Algernon Blackwood</p><p>*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THREE JOHN SILENCE STORIES ***</p><p>***** This file should be named 10624.txt or 10624.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/6/2/10624/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/6/2/10624/</a></p><p>Produced by Suzanne Shell, Dave Morgan and PG Distributed Proofreaders</p><p>ll use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</p><ul><li><p>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work.</p></li><li><p>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</p></li></ul><p>1.E.9.
