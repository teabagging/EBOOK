Some of the most open patterns are suitable for Shetland shawls; and as the majority of the chair covers are now done in coloured wool, the colours and number of shades will be described; though, if wished in white, the linen thread, No. 1, is the proper material to be used.</p><p>I.</p><p>German Pattern of Open Double Knitting, both Sides alike.</p><p>Large wooden pins are required for this pattern, which is done in double or eight-threaded wool, in 5 colours that contrast well--claret, gold colour, blue, white, scarlet; and 4 rows of each, worked in the order they are here placed. Cast on 71 stitches.</p><p>First row:--Seam 1, make 1, slip 1: this row is only to begin with, and is not repeated, the whole of the knitting being done as the</p><p>Second row:--Seam 2 together, make 1, by passing the wool round the pin, slip 1, and repeat. At the end of the row, if correctly knitted, there will be 1 stitch, which seam. When the colours have been repeated 6 times, the cover will be the proper size.</p><p>To finish it round, work fringe No. 2, work claret for the head, and put in two lengths of each colour in the fringe.</p><p>II.</p><p>Nun&#39;s Pattern.</p><p>Pins No. 10, 8 stitches to a pattern: 14 shades of orange 4-threaded German wool, beginning with the darkest, and working 6 rows of each: 4 plain rows to begin and end the cover; and 4 plain stitches at the beginning and end of every row, for an edge. These edge stitches are not mentioned with the pattern, but will be included in the number cast on. Cast on 112 stitches.</p><p>First row:--Make 1, knit 1, make 1, knit 2, slip 1, knit 2 together, pass the slipped stitch over, knit 2, and repeat.</p><p>Second row:--Seamed.</p><p>Third row:--Make 1, knit 3, make 1, knit 1, slip 1, knit 2 together, pass the slipped stitch over, knit 1, and repeat.</p><p>Fourth row:--Seamed.</p><p>Fifth row:--Make 1, knit 5, make 1, slip 1, knit 2 together, pass the slipped stitch over, and repeat.</p><p>Sixth row:--Seamed.

When deep enough, diminish your stitches to 60. Knit 2 seamed rows in colour, then 2 plain white, and 6 rows of bars, formed by knitting 2 plain and 2 seamed stitches alternately for 3 rows, and then 2 plain rounds, then reverse the ribbing, and so on, with 2 plain rounds between. Divide the back and front--on the 2 back pins 32 stitches, 28 on the front; on the back pins knit 2 more plain rows, on the front continue the bars 6 more rows, and at the end knit 4 plain rows. This finishes the stocking part.</p><p>For the shoe, set on 32 stitches of coloured wool on a separate pin: 1 plain row, and 1 row of holes for ribbon to go through, 1 plain row, and then join it to the back part of the stocking, knit 2 seamed rows, 2 plain, 3 rows of bars, and 2 seamed rows. Divide for the heel 12 stitches on the middle pin, and 10 on each side, which you bind down. Continue 3 plain rows on the middle part where there are 12 stitches, and 3 rows of bars; no plain rows at the end; take up each side of the heel 10 stitches, and seam 3 rows. For the foot part, knit 2 plain rows, and 8 rows of bars, before knitting the plain rows to these 8 rows of bars. Set on 28 stitches of coloured wool on a separate pin, and after knitting 2 seamed rows, join it to the front part of the stocking, then knit 2 plain rounds all round to join the whole, but in the back part reduce 4 stitches to make it equal with the 28 in front. Commence the pattern or bars on the back pin, and make the 1st stitch a plain one, at the end of that pin, and on the front one seam 3 stitches to form the side of the shoe, with 2 plain rows as before, narrowing at the end and beginning of the pins. At the beginning of the pins, narrow the 1st stitch, and at the end before the 3 seamed stitches, and only narrow in the plain rows. When you have narrowed to have 10 on the front and back pins, 20 in all, knit 4 plain rows, and finish by turning it and binding down. The front part of the shoe should have 4 rows of bars; join the sides of the shoe and stocking, and knit 4 seamed rows; draw a ribbon through the back part where you made the holes.</p><p>Shell Pattern for a Baby&#39;s Cap.</p><p>Pins No. 22, and the finest linen thread.</p><p>The front part is knit with 2 needles only. Cast on 208 stitches, knit 5 rows plain for the beginning. After these 5, you must diminish 1 stitch in every shell, so as to have only 192. Then 3 rows of the pattern, or shells, 2 rows of holes (for putting narrow ribbon in) before doing the pattern again, which is done in this manner: bring your thread forward, knit 2 stitches together, and so on to the end of your needle. Knit 5 rows of plain between these 2 rows of holes; when this is concluded, knit 4 rows of the shells, and then 2 rows of the holes the same as before, with the 5 plain rows between, then again 2 rows of the pattern or shells. You now take your two other needles, and increase 43 stitches for the back of the head; 2 rows plain, 1 row for putting ribbon in, and 3 rows plain, then knit 8 rows of the shells; the 7th row you must have 7 holes in each shell, and the 8th but 6. After this, seam the first and second stitches, knit the third plain, without taking it off, and twist it so as to make 2 stitches of this last one; then seam the fifth, slip the sixth without knitting, knit the seventh plain, and pass the sixth over, knit the eighth plain, slip the ninth, and the tenth knit plain, and pass the ninth over it. The next row: seam the first stitch, slip the second, knit the third, and pass the second over without taking it off, and knit it twisted; twist the fourth, seam the fifth, and knit the 3 remaining plain. After this row, knit 2 rows plain all round; after these, make a row of holes (for putting ribbon in) by taking 2 stitches together, and making one as before. First 3 rows plain all round, another row of holes, and then 3 rows plain. Then do the pattern 8 shells round the cap, and so continue until you have but 5 stitches instead of 9 (not including the 2 twisted, and the seamed).</p><p>After this row, seam the 1st, twist the 2d and 3d, seam the 4th, raise a stitch by picking up a loop, slip the 5th, knit the 6th, and pass the 5th over, knit the 7th plain, and take the 8th and 9th together, raise one stitch before beginning to seam.</p><p>The next row:--Seam the 1st, slip the 2d, knit the 3d plain, and pass the 2d half through, and knit it plain, seam the 4th, knit the 5th plain, slip the 6th without knitting, knit the 7th, and pass over the 6th to the left, and the 8th to the right, knit the 9th plain.</p><p>Then do 2 rows of plain knitting all round, 2 rows of the holes (for ribbon), knitting 2 rows plain to divide them, and 4 plain rows to finish with. Take off your stitches on a needle with coarse thread, and tie it up.</p><p>The pattern stitch:--First row:--Seam the 1st stitch, twist the 2d and 3d, seam the 4th, knit the 5th plain, bring your thread forward, and so continue for 9 stitches plain, counting the 5th for 1; by putting your thread forward, you will have 17 stitches.</p><p>Second row:--Seam the 1st stitch, twist the 2d and 3d, seam the 4th, and knit the 17 plain when with 4 needles, and seam them when with 2.</p><p>Third row:--Seam the 1st, twist the 2d and 3d, seam the 4th, slip the 5th, knit the 6th plain, and pass over the 5th; knit 15 stitches plain, including the 6th, and take 2 together at the 15th.</p><p>Fourth row:--The same as the 3d, with the exception of the number, which is 13 this time, diminishing at the first and thirteenth as before.</p><p>Fifth row:--The same as the fourth row, only 11 stitches instead of 13.</p><p>Sixth row:--The same as the fifth, only 9 stitches instead of 11.</p><p>After the 6 rows, you begin at the first again, the 6 rows comprising all the pattern.</p><p>For a Knitted Bodice.</p><p>Five ounces of four-thread fleecy, and No. 10 pins.</p><p>Cast on 60 stitches, and knit 3 plain rows.</p><p>Fourth row:--Make a stitch, knit 2 together, make a stitch, knit 2 together, and so on to the end of the row; knit 4 plain rows, knit 70 rows in double knitting, knit the 4 first and last stitches of every row plain, then let off all the stitches on to a piece of thread, except 25 on the right-hand side. *Knit these 25 stitches backwards and forwards (remembering that the 4 plain stitches are still to be knit on the right-hand side, but not on the other) for 26 rows; then cast on 15 additional stitches; the 4 plain stitches are now to be knit on both sides for 74 rows. Knit 3 plain rows.</p><p>Next row:--Make a stitch, knit 2 together, make a stitch, knit 2 together, and so on, knit 3 plain rows, and cast off. This completes the back and one front. You then let off 25 stitches on the other side, and repeat from the point marked above with an asterisk. Then take up the stitches all round the neck, and knit 3 plain rows.</p><p>Next row:--Make a stitch and knit 2 together alternately, knit 4 plain rows, and cast off. Then sew the two fronts to the back, about one third of the length up, and run a ribbon through the row of holes formed at the top and bottom. This is worn outside the dress; and under a shawl or cloak is very comfortable. All should be done in double knitting but the 4 edge stitches.</p><p>Pretty Open Pattern.</p><p>Nine stitches to a pattern.

Take 11 shades of wool, begin with the darkest, and 4 rows of each shade; that is, 1 pattern done of each. Cast on 155 stitches, 57 on 2 of the needles, and 38 on the third.</p><p>First round:--Knit 4 stitches plain. Bring the wool forward, knit 1, bring the wool forward, knit 1. Repeat this 8 times. Knit 4 plain, seam 3. Repeat this all round.</p><p>Second round:--Knit 2 plain, 2 together, 15 plain, slip 1, knit 1, draw the slipped one over the knitted one, knit 3 plain, seam 4.

Tie on the next shade, and repeat the 5 rows as before. Repeat this 15 times. Then take very small needles, and knit a binder, in simple ribs, in any of the shades, 15 rows deep.</p><p>The handle is made by knitting on 2 needles of the same size as those used for the bag, with double wool, in the following manner:--Cast on 14 stitches, slip 1, bring the wool forward, slip 1, knit 1, pull the slipped one over the knitted one to the last 2, which are both knitted; without bringing the wool forward, fold the two edges into the middle, and sew together with the double wool. Silk tassels to match.</p><p>Pretty Pattern for Basket Serviettes.</p><p>Six stitches to a pattern.

Large wooden pins are required, and 12-threaded fleecy, dark claret for the open stripe, and white, with 4 shades of gold, green, lilac, and scarlet, form a good combination of colours for the close stripe, and are extremely rich in their effect. For the open stripe cast on 18 stitches.</p><p>First row:--Knit 2 stitches, bring the wool forward, pass the first of the 2 knit stitches over, knit 2, bring the wool forward, pass the first of the 2 knit stitches over, repeat.</p><p>Second row:--Seamed: repeat these 2 rows alternately till you have done the length you wish your mat to be.</p><p>For the close stripe cast on 20 stitches, and knit the same length as the open stripe. When finished, pin it on to a weighted cushion to work the pattern on it, as that stretches the knitting, and shews more plainly where you should put your needle in.</p><p>Then work the annexed pattern on it.

Knit 24 rows with the white, then slip off 24 stitches at the beginning of the next row, and join the coloured wool, leave 24 stitches at the other end. These stitches are not required again till the centre is done, and are then knitted in white to form the border up the sides: this will leave 222, knit with these, with the coloured wool for 12 rows.</p><p>Next row:--Knit 27, bring the wool forward, slip 1, and instead of knitting only 2 together, knit 5 together: this decreases 1 rib. Knit to within 30 stitches of the end, decrease 1 rib as before, knit 13 rows, and decrease 1 rib at the beginning and end of the next row as before: each decreasing is done at the beginning of the row after knitting 27 stitches, and when within 30 of the end; knit 11 rows, and decrease 1 rib at each end of the next row; knit 13 rows, and decrease 1 rib at each end; knit 13 rows.</p><p>Next row:--Knit 27 stitches, decrease 1 rib; knit 6 stitches, decrease 1 rib; knit 6 stitches, decrease again; knit and repeat, decreasing after every 6 stitches, till 14 ribs are decreased; knit the 30 last stitches without decreasing; knit 24 rows without decreasing.</p><p>Next row:--Knit 27 stitches on to another needle, and knit them backwards and forwards for 42 rows: then cast off 3 stitches at the end nearest the centre, knit 2 rows, cast off 3 more stitches, knit 2 rows, and cast off 3 more stitches, till only 9 stitches are left, then cast off the 9 stitches; this completes 1 front, except the white, which will be mentioned below. The 27 last stitches are knitted in the same manner for the other front; then the stitches that remain for the back are knitted for 42 rows; then cast off 3 stitches at each end, knit 2 rows, and cast off 3 at each end, till you have cast off 18 at each end, knit 2 plain rows, and cast off the remainder of the stitches; then sew the shoulders very loosely, or it will contract them. The 24 stitches of white that were let off to another pin must be knit on each side the length of the front, and neatly sewed to it.</p><p>For the sleeves:--Cast on 66 stitches, and knit 78 rows: this is for the coloured part, and in sewing it together at the elbow, it must be rather tightened; and for the cuff, which is done in white, cast on 18 stitches and knit 66 rows, and sew it very nicely to the coloured part.</p><p>For the collar:--Cast on 120 stitches with white, knit 8 rows.</p><p>Next row:--Knit to within 12 stitches of the end, turn back, and knit to within 12 of the other end.</p><p>Next row:--Leave 6 more stitches at each end.</p><p>Next row:--Leave 24 stitches at each end, then 33, 39, 45, and 48 stitches, turning back between each as before, knit to the end of the row with white, join the coloured wool, knit 8 rows.</p><p>Next row:--Leave 12 stitches at the end, turn back, and leave the same number at the other end.</p><p>Next row:--Leave 18, then 24, 30, 36, and 42, at each end, then 2 rows of coloured, knitting the whole number of stitches, then cast off, and sew it to the neck.</p><p>A cord of tassels for the neck and waist, made of the white and coloured wool, to be added, and little tufts of black wool sewed into the white border at equal distances, completes this elegant pelisse.</p><p>Half Cap for Wearing under a Bonnet.</p><p>Pins No. 14.

In the fourth row, seam 2 stitches together, pass the wool round the pin, seam 2 together, and so on to the end of the row. Continue in this manner, knitting 3 plain rows, and an open row of each shade, till the darkest; then again to the lightest: this forms 1 stripe, 4 of which are required. The last stripe should finish with the lightest shade, to correspond with the beginning. The shading of each stripe must be reversed; thus, first begin with the lightest shade and knit to the darkest, then knit from the darkest to the lightest, and then again to the darkest, and so on. This should be done in double German wool, in five shades of sable or chinchilla colours, and satin put underneath the knitting of the same colour.</p><p>A Swiss Pattern for the Top of a Mitten or Muffatee.</p><p>Cast on 26 stitches on 3 needles.

Set 30 stitches on each of 3 needles; and, after knitting a top either in ribs or any other pattern, begin the fan, by seaming the first stitch; the second stitch plain, except that you take the outside part of the stitch; seam the third; knit the fourth quite plain; bring the thread in front of the next 6 stitches, and knit them, which makes 13 stitches. With the fourth you knit plain, then seam again, as at first, and so on for 1 round.</p><p>Second round:--Seam the 3 first stitches, as at the beginning, and wherever you did in the first round; knit the other 13 stitches quite plain.</p><p>Third round:--Seam the 3 first stitches, as in the first round, slip the fourth stitch, knit the next, and bring the slipped stitch over them; knit the others plain, till you come to the 2 last before the seamed stitch; then with your left-hand needle take off the last knit stitch, and bring the one from behind over that, which decreases 2 with the one you did after seaming, and so on for 1 round, and every other, till you have reduced the 13 stitches to 7; then begin again the first round.</p><p>It is well to count the stitches frequently, that you may have them even, allowing 3 for the ribs and 7 plain, whenever you begin the fan, so that there will be 3 fans on each needle. When you have 4 or 5 rounds of fans, begin the thumb by bringing the silk forward, and knitting a stitch, which increases 1; then knit a plain stitch, and increase the same as before. This do every other row, till you have as many as you think enough--say 30 stitches; leave the 30 stitches, and go on with the hand part, and finish that off at the top; after, knit the thumb. Observe, in increasing, to bring your silk directly over the stitch you increased to the right hand; and to the left, knit over, and bring the silk in front of the stitch after the increased.</p><p>Corkscrew Muffatees.</p><p>Five skeins of German wool are required for each: the 2 first and last should be alike, the middle one white.

Three rounds of 3 stitches plain and 3 seamed. Then 3 rounds, the first 2 and last stitches seamed, and the middle 3 plain, and 3 seamed. Then seam the first and last 2 stitches of the next 3 rounds, and begin the whole pattern again, only knitting 3 rounds instead of 2, as at first, of 3 seamed and 3 plain.</p><p>Gentlemen&#39;s Cuffs: an Excellent Pattern.</p><p>Shetland wool.

Knit 1 row plain. Second row: knit 40 stitches plain, seam a stitch, knit all round plain. Knit 12 rows in the same way, all plain but the seam-stitch. Now the pattern begins: seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a stitch, knit 15 plain. This will bring you to the centre seam-stitch. Seam this stitch, and knit 15 plain. This brings you to the end of the first needle. Seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a stitch, knit 23 plain. This will end the second needle. Seam a stitch, knit 23 plain, seam a stitch, knit 23 plain. This ends the third needle. Seam a stitch, knit 6 plain stitches, bring the cotton forward, knit 1, bring the cotton forward and knit 1. Continue to bring the cotton forward and knit 1 till you have made 12 additional stitches. Knit 5 plain, seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch, knit 15. (This is the back of the stocking, and must always be knit the same--15 plain, 1 seamed, and 15 plain.) Seam a stitch, knit 6 plain, bring the cotton forward, and knit 1. Continue this till you have made 12 additional stitches, as before. Knit 5, seam a stitch, knit 6, bring the cotton forward, and make 12 stitches as before. Knit 5, seam a stitch, knit 6, make 12 stitches as before. Knit 5, seam a stitch, knit 6, make 12 as before, and knit 5. This finishes the row; and you have 60 additional stitches for the pattern. Seam a stitch and knit 35 plain, seam a stitch and knit the back of the stocking, seam a stitch and knit 35, seam and knit 35, seam and knit 35, seam and knit 35. This ends the row. Knit 2 rows more same as the last. You have now made stitches enough for the pattern, and begin it. First row: seam a stitch, knit 2 together 6 times, bring the cotton forward, and knit 1. Continue this till you have 11 holes made. Bring the cotton forward and slip a stitch, knit a stitch, pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one, slip a stitch, knit a stitch, pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one. Continue to slip a stitch, knit a stitch, and pull the slipped one over it 4 times more, which should bring you to the seam-stitch. Knit the back of the stocking, and continue this pattern round the other two needles, which will conclude the row. The next 3 rows are knit plain, except the seam-stitches, which must be attended to. This finishes the pattern; and you begin again at the first row, and repeat the pattern 45 times. You then begin the heel: knit the seam-stitch on the 1st needle plain, then knit the pattern-row of the stripe; knit the back of the stocking and knit the 1st stripe off of the next needle, (using the needle you have knit the stripe and the back of the stocking with,) remembering that this is the pattern-row; knit the seam-stitch at the end of the stripe plain. You have now 2 stripes and the plain back of the stocking on the heel needles, and 3 stripes on the front of the stocking; with the front you have at present nothing to do. The first or pattern row of the heel is knit; the remainder of the heel is to be knit with double thread. Second row: slip a stitch, seam 35 stitches, knit a plain stitch, seam 15, knit 1 plain, seam 15, knit 1 plain, seam 36. Third row: slip a stitch, knit 35, seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch, knit 15, seam a stitch, knit 36. Fourth row: slip 1, seam 35, knit 1 plain, seam 15, knit 1 plain, seam 15, knit 1 plain, seam 36. Begin again with the pattern-row, remembering that there is 1 plain stitch at the beginning and end of each needle, which stitch must be slipped at the beginning of every row. Repeat this pattern 9 times: at the 10th time slip a stitch, knit 7 double stitches, make 8 holes, narrowing from the last hole, 7 times, in the same manner as usual; this will reduce the pattern 6 stitches. For the 11th time: slip 1, knit 7 double stitches, make 2 holes, narrowing from the 2d hole in the usual manner; this will have reduced the heel 14 stitches in each stripe, and finishes the pattern. Knit 10 plain rows, knitting all the seam-stitches except the middle one plain. The heel must now be closed; the narrowing must begin in the row of plain knitting, not the seamed one. Knit 26 stitches, knit 2 together, knit 11 stitches, which brings you to the seam; knit 11 stitches beyond the seam, slip a stitch, knit a stitch, pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one, turn back, slip 1 stitch, and seam 11 stitches, knit the seam-stitch plain, seam 11 stitches, seam 2 together, turn back, slip a stitch, knit to the seam-stitch and 11 stitches beyond, slip a stitch, knit a stitch, and pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one. Continue this narrowing till you have knit up all the stitches at each side. Take up the loops all along the side of the heel (they should be 29), knit them with the single thread, knitting the 2 last on the needle together. This begins the gore. Knit the 3 stripes on the front needle, in the pattern, as usual, only remembering that you have no seam-stitch between the gore and the pattern; take up the loops all along the 2d side of the heel, and take half the heel stitches on the same needle, then slip the 1st stitch, knit the 2d, pull the slipped stitch over it, knit the remaining stitches on the needle. There should now be 41 stitches on each of the side needles. The middle of the heel ends the row, therefore the 1st needle is the one which begins from that place. Knit 15 stitches plain, make a stitch by taking up a loop of the last row, knit 3 stitches, make another as before, continue to knit 3 and make 1 till you have increased 11 stitches, which will bring you within 4 stitches of the end of the needle; knit them plain. Knit the front needle in the 2d row of pattern, knitting 35 and seaming 1, knitting 35, seaming 1, knitting 35, which ends the needle. Knit 3 stitches, make 1, knit 3 as before, till you have made 11, knit 15 plain, which ends the row. There should now be 51 stitches on each of the side needles. You must knit to within 2 stitches of the end of the 1st needle; knit them together. Knit the front needle in 3d row of pattern. Third needle: slip a stitch, knit a stitch, pull the slipped stitch over it, knit to the end of the needle plain. The next row is not to be narrowed at either place. Continue to narrow the side needles, as directed, every second row, carrying on the pattern on the front needle, till you have reduced the stitches on each side needle, the first to 35, and the second to 36 stitches. There will now be 173 stitches all round. Continue to knit the side needles plain, and the front in pattern, till you have repeated the pattern from the beginning of the gore 32 times, join on the second thread, and narrow the pattern 14 stitches in each stripe in the manner directed for the heel. There will now be 136 stitches on the needles. Knit 8 plain rows. Divide the stitches exactly, leaving 68 on the front needle, and 34 on each of the side needles. The first needle of the row is the same as before. Knit to within 3 stitches of the end, slip 1, knit 1, pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one, knit 1 plain. Second needle: knit 1 plain stitch, knit 2 together, knit to within 3 stitches of the end, slip 1, knit 1, pull the slipped stitch over the knitted one, knit 1 plain. Third needle: knit 1 plain, knit 2 together, knit 1 to the end, knit 1 plain row all round. Continue these alternate rows till you have reduced the stitches to 88, then narrow every row, as directed, till there remain only 30 stitches on the front needle, and 15 on each of the others. Cast off, and fasten the thread.</p><p>For a Brioche.</p><p>Either 8-thread German or 3-thread fleecy should be used. Pins No. 12. Cast on 90 stitches; keep the wool in front, slip a stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, pass the wool in front, slip a stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, pass the wool in front, slip a stitch the reversed way, knit 2 together, and so on. The whole of the knitting is done in this manner; then knit 2 rows of dark for the edge, 2 rows of the colour for the centre, 2 more dark: these 6 rows form an edge, which is done on each side of each piece. Then commence the centre part of the stripe, and knit 2 rows to the end; in the third row, leave 6 stitches at the end, and turn back, as if beginning a fresh row, and knit to the end; in the next row, leave 12 stitches; then 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42 stitches; after leaving 42 stitches, you must only leave 3 more each time instead of 6; and next leave 45, 48, 51, and so on, until you have only 15 stitches left; then knit 2 rows of dark (the whole number of stitches), 2 of the centre colour, 2 of dark; and take it off like common knitting. This completes 1 piece, 16 of which are required, and look pretty placed--scarlet, white, blue, gold, scarlet, white, lilac, green: this forms half the brioche, and the colours are repeated.</p><p>Very Pretty Vandyke Border.</p><p>Pins No. 19, and No. 10 boar&#39;s-head thread.</p><p>First row:--Cast on 10 stitches, slip 1, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, pass the thread twice over the pin, knit 2 together, knit 1 plain.</p><p>Second row:--Slip 1, knit 1, knit half the stitch turned twice over the needle, seam the other half, knit 2, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together.</p><p>Third row:--Slip 1, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 4 plain stitches.</p><p>Fourth row:--Make a stitch, knit 4, knit 2, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together.</p><p>Fifth row:--Slip 1, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, pass the thread twice round the pin, knit 2 together, pass the thread twice round the pin, knit 2 together, knit 1 plain.</p><p>Sixth row:--Slip 1, knit 1, knit the first half of the double stitch, seam the other half, knit 1, knit the first half of the double stitch, seam the other half, knit 2 plain, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together.</p><p>Seventh row:--Slip 1, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit the remainder of the stitches plain.</p><p>Eighth row:--Knit 9 plain stitches, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together.</p><p>Ninth row:--Slip 1, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, knit 1, bring the thread forward, knit 2 together, pass the thread twice over the needle, knit 2 together.
