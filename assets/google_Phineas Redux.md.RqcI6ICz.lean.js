THROWING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK.</p><p>VOLUME I.</p><p>CHAPTER I.</p><p>TEMPTATION.</p><p>The circumstances of the general election of 18-- will be well remembered by all those who take an interest in the political matters of the country. There had been a coming in and a going out of Ministers previous to that,--somewhat rapid, very exciting, and, upon the whole, useful as showing the real feeling of the country upon sundry questions of public interest. Mr. Gresham had been Prime Minister of England, as representative of the Liberal party in politics. There had come to be a split among those who should have been his followers on the terribly vexed question of the Ballot. Then Mr. Daubeny for twelve months had sat upon the throne distributing the good things of the Crown amidst Conservative birdlings, with beaks wide open and craving maws, who certainly for some years previous had not received their share of State honours or State emoluments. And Mr. Daubeny was still so sitting, to the infinite dismay of the Liberals, every man of whom felt that his party was entitled by numerical strength to keep the management of the Government within its own hands.</p><p>Let a man be of what side he may in politics,--unless he be much more of a partisan than a patriot,--he will think it well that there should be some equity of division in the bestowal of crumbs of comfort. Can even any old Whig wish that every Lord Lieutenant of a county should be an old Whig? Can it be good for the administration of the law that none but Liberal lawyers should become Attorney-Generals, and from thence Chief Justices or Lords of Appeal? Should no Conservative Peer ever represent the majesty of England in India, in Canada, or at St. Petersburgh? So arguing, moderate Liberals had been glad to give Mr. Daubeny and his merry men a chance. Mr. Daubeny and his merry men had not neglected the chance given them. Fortune favoured them, and they made their hay while the sun shone with an energy that had never been surpassed, improving upon Fortune, till their natural enemies waxed impatient. There had been as yet but one year of it, and the natural enemies, who had at first expressed themselves as glad that the turn had come, might have endured the period of spoliation with more equanimity. For to them, the Liberals, this cutting up of the Whitehall cake by the Conservatives was spoliation when the privilege of cutting was found to have so much exceeded what had been expected. Were not they, the Liberals, the real representatives of the people, and, therefore, did not the cake in truth appertain to them? Had not they given up the cake for a while, partly, indeed, through idleness and mismanagement, and quarrelling among themselves; but mainly with a feeling that a moderate slicing on the other side would, upon the whole, be advantageous? But when the cake came to be mauled like that--oh, heavens! So the men who had quarrelled agreed to quarrel no more, and it was decided that there should be an end of mismanagement and idleness, and that this horrid sight of the weak pretending to be strong, or the weak receiving the reward of strength, should be brought to an end. Then came a great fight, in the last agonies of which the cake was sliced manfully. All the world knew how the fight would go; but in the meantime lord-lieutenancies were arranged; very ancient judges retired upon pensions; vice-royal Governors were sent out in the last gasp of the failing battle; great places were filled by tens, and little places by twenties; private secretaries were established here and there; and the hay was still made even after the sun had gone down.</p><p>In consequence of all this the circumstances of the election of 18-- were peculiar. Mr. Daubeny had dissolved the House, not probably with any idea that he could thus retrieve his fortunes, but feeling that in doing so he was occupying the last normal position of a properly-fought Constitutional battle. His enemies were resolved, more firmly than they were resolved before, to knock him altogether on the head at the general election which he had himself called into existence. He had been disgracefully out-voted in the House of Commons on various subjects. On the last occasion he had gone into his lobby with a minority of 37, upon a motion brought forward by Mr. Palliser, the late Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer, respecting decimal coinage. No politician, not even Mr. Palliser himself, had expected that he would carry his Bill in the present session. It was brought forward as a trial of strength; and for such a purpose decimal coinage was as good a subject as any other. It was Mr. Palliser&#39;s hobby, and he was gratified at having this further opportunity of ventilating it. When in power, he had not succeeded in carrying his measure, awed, and at last absolutely beaten, by the infinite difficulty encountered in arranging its details. But his mind was still set upon it, and it was allowed by the whole party to be as good as anything else for the purpose then required. The Conservative Government was beaten for the third or fourth time, and Mr. Daubeny dissolved the House.</p><p>The whole world said that he might as well have resigned at once. It was already the end of July, and there must be an autumn Session with the new members. It was known to be impossible that he should find himself supported by a majority after a fresh election. He had been treated with manifest forbearance; the cake had been left in his hands for twelve months; the House was barely two years old; he had no &quot;cry&quot; with which to meet the country; the dissolution was factious, dishonest, and unconstitutional. So said all the Liberals, and it was deduced also that the Conservatives were in their hearts as angry as were their opponents. What was to be gained but the poor interval of three months? There were clever men who suggested that Mr. Daubeny had a scheme in his head--some sharp trick of political conjuring, some &quot;hocus-pocus presto&quot; sleight of hand, by which he might be able to retain power, let the elections go as they would. But, if so, he certainly did not make his scheme known to his own party.</p><p>He had no cry with which to meet the country, nor, indeed, had the leaders of the Opposition. Retrenchment, army reform, navy excellence, Mr. Palliser&#39;s decimal coinage, and general good government gave to all the old-Whig moderate Liberals plenty of matter for speeches to their future constituents. Those who were more advanced could promise the Ballot, and suggest the disestablishment of the Church. But the Government of the day was to be turned out on the score of general incompetence. They were to be made to go, because they could not command majorities. But there ought to have been no dissolution, and Mr. Daubeny was regarded by his opponents, and indeed by very many of his followers also, with an enmity that was almost ferocious. A seat in Parliament, if it be for five or six years, is a blessing; but the blessing becomes very questionable if it have to be sought afresh every other Session.</p><p>One thing was manifest to thoughtful, working, eager political Liberals. They must have not only a majority in the next Parliament, but a majority of good men--of men good and true. There must be no more mismanagement; no more quarrelling; no more idleness. Was it to be borne that an unprincipled so-called Conservative Prime Minister should go on slicing the cake after such a fashion as that lately adopted? Old bishops had even talked of resigning, and Knights of the Garter had seemed to die on purpose. So there was a great stir at the Liberal political clubs, and every good and true man was summoned to the battle.</p><p>Now no Liberal soldier, as a young soldier, had been known to be more good and true than Mr. Finn, the Irishman, who had held office two years ago to the satisfaction of all his friends, and who had retired from office because he had found himself compelled to support a measure which had since been carried by those very men from whom he had been obliged on this account to divide himself. It had always been felt by his old friends that he had been, if not ill-used, at least very unfortunate. He had been twelve months in advance of his party, and had consequently been driven out into the cold. So when the names of good men and true were mustered, and weighed, and discussed, and scrutinised by some active members of the Liberal party in a certain very private room not far removed from our great seat of parliamentary warfare; and when the capabilities, and expediencies, and possibilities were tossed to and fro among these active members, it came to pass that the name of Mr. Finn was mentioned more than once. Mr. Phineas Finn was the gentleman&#39;s name--which statement may be necessary to explain the term of endearment which was occasionally used in speaking of him.</p><p>&quot;He has got some permanent place,&quot; said Mr. Ratler, who was living on the well-founded hope of being a Treasury Secretary under the new dispensation; &quot;and of course he won&#39;t leave it.&quot;</p><p>It must be acknowledged that Mr. Ratler, than whom no judge in such matters possessed more experience, had always been afraid of Phineas Finn.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;ll lave it fast enough, if you&#39;ll make it worth his while,&quot; said the Honourable Laurence Fitzgibbon, who also had his expectations.</p><p>&quot;But he married when he went away, and he can&#39;t afford it,&quot; said Mr. Bonteen, another keen expectant.</p><p>&quot;Devil a bit,&quot; said the Honourable Laurence; &quot;or, anyways, the poor thing died of her first baby before it was born. Phinny hasn&#39;t an impidiment, no more than I have.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s the best Irishman we ever got hold of,&quot; said Barrington Erle--&quot;present company always excepted, Laurence.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bedad, you needn&#39;t except me, Barrington. I know what a man&#39;s made of, and what a man can do. And I know what he can&#39;t do. I&#39;m not bad at the outside skirmishing. I&#39;m worth me salt. I say that with a just reliance on me own powers. But Phinny is a different sort of man. Phinny can stick to a desk from twelve to seven, and wish to come back again after dinner. He&#39;s had money left him, too, and &#39;d like to spend some of it on an English borough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You never can quite trust him,&quot; said Bonteen. Now Mr. Bonteen had never loved Mr. Finn.</p><p>&quot;At any rate we&#39;ll try him again,&quot; said Barrington Erle, making a little note to that effect. And they did try him again.</p><p>Phineas Finn, when last seen by the public, was departing from parliamentary life in London to the enjoyment of a modest place under Government in his own country, with something of a shattered ambition. After various turmoils he had achieved a competency, and had married the girl of his heart. But now his wife was dead, and he was again alone in the world. One of his friends had declared that money had been left to him. That was true, but the money had not been much. Phineas Finn had lost his father as well as his wife, and had inherited about four thousand pounds. He was not at this time much over thirty; and it must be acknowledged in regard to him that, since the day on which he had accepted place and retired from London, his very soul had sighed for the lost glories of Westminster and Downing Street.</p><p>There are certain modes of life which, if once adopted, make contentment in any other circumstances almost an impossibility. In old age a man may retire without repining, though it is often beyond the power even of the old man to do so; but in youth, with all the faculties still perfect, with the body still strong, with the hopes still buoyant, such a change as that which had been made by Phineas Finn was more than he, or than most men, could bear with equanimity. He had revelled in the gas-light, and could not lie quiet on a sunny bank. To the palate accustomed to high cookery, bread and milk is almost painfully insipid. When Phineas Finn found himself discharging in Dublin the routine duties of his office,--as to which there was no public comment, no feeling that such duties were done in the face of the country,--he became sick at heart and discontented. Like the warhorse out at grass he remembered the sound of the battle and the noise of trumpets. After five years spent in the heat and full excitement of London society, life in Ireland was tame to him, and cold, and dull. He did not analyse the difference between metropolitan and quasi-metropolitan manners; but he found that men and women in Dublin were different from those to whom he had been accustomed in London. He had lived among lords, and the sons and daughters of lords; and though the official secretaries and assistant commissioners among whom his lot now threw him were for the most part clever fellows, fond of society, and perhaps more than his equals in the kind of conversation which he found to be prevalent, still they were not the same as the men he had left behind him,--men alive with the excitement of parliamentary life in London. When in London he had often told himself that he was sick of it, and that he would better love some country quiet life. Now Dublin was his Tibur, and the fickle one found that he could not be happy unless he were back again at Rome. When, therefore, he received the following letter from his friend, Barrington Erle, he neighed like the old warhorse, and already found himself shouting &quot;Ha, ha,&quot; among the trumpets.</p><p>---- Street, 9th July, 18--.</p><p>MY DEAR FINN,</p><p>Although you are not now immediately concerned in such trifling matters you have no doubt heard that we are all to be sent back at once to our constituents, and that there will be a general election about the end of September. We are sure that we shall have such a majority as we never had before; but we are determined to make it as strong as possible, and to get in all the good men that are to be had. Have you a mind to try again? After all, there is nothing like it.</p><p>Perhaps you may have some Irish seat in your eye for which you would be safe. To tell the truth we know very little of the Irish seats--not so much as, I think, we ought to do. But if you are not so lucky I would suggest Tankerville in Durham. Of course there would be a contest, and a little money will be wanted; but the money would not be much. Browborough has sat for the place now for three Parliaments, and seems to think it all his own. I am told that nothing could be easier than to turn him out. You will remember the man--a great, hulking, heavy, speechless fellow, who always used to sit just over Lord Macaw&#39;s shoulder. I have made inquiry, and I am told that he must walk if anybody would go down who could talk to the colliers every night for a week or so. It would just be the work for you. Of course, you should have all the assistance we could give you, and Molescroft would put you into the hands of an agent who wouldn&#39;t spend money for you. L500 would do it all.</p><p>I am very sorry to hear of your great loss, as also was Lady Laura, who, as you are aware, is still abroad with her father. We have all thought that the loneliness of your present life might perhaps make you willing to come back among us. I write instead of Ratler, because I am helping him in the Northern Counties. But you will understand all about that.</p><p>Yours, ever faithfully,</p><p>BARRINGTON ERLE.</p><p>Of course Tankerville has been dirty. Browborough has spent a fortune there. But I do not think that that need dishearten you. You will go there with clean hands. It must be understood that there shall not be as much as a glass of beer. I am told that the fellows won&#39;t vote for Browborough unless he spends money, and I fancy he will be afraid to do it heavily after all that has come and gone. If he does you&#39;ll have him out on a petition. Let us have an answer as soon as possible.</p><p>He at once resolved that he would go over and see; but, before he replied to Erle&#39;s letter, he walked half-a-dozen times the length of the pier at Kingston meditating on his answer. He had no one belonging to him. He had been deprived of his young bride, and left desolate. He could ruin no one but himself. Where could there be a man in all the world who had a more perfect right to play a trick with his own prospects? If he threw up his place and spent all his money, who could blame him? Nevertheless, he did tell himself that, when he should have thrown up his place and spent all his money, there would remain to him his own self to be disposed of in a manner that might be very awkward to him. A man owes it to his country, to his friends, even to his acquaintance, that he shall not be known to be going about wanting a dinner, with never a coin in his pocket. It is very well for a man to boast that he is lord of himself, and that having no ties he may do as he pleases with that possession. But it is a possession of which, unfortunately, he cannot rid himself when he finds that there is nothing advantageous to be done with it. Doubtless there is a way of riddance. There is the bare bodkin. Or a man may fall overboard between Holyhead and Kingston in the dark, and may do it in such a cunning fashion that his friends shall think that it was an accident. But against these modes of riddance there is a canon set, which some men still fear to disobey.</p><p>The thing that he was asked to do was perilous. Standing in his present niche of vantage he was at least safe. And added to his safety there were material comforts. He had more than enough for his wants. His work was light; he lived among men and women with whom he was popular. The very fact of his past parliamentary life had caused him to be regarded as a man of some note among the notables of the Irish capital. Lord Lieutenants were gracious to him, and the wives of judges smiled upon him at their tables. He was encouraged to talk of those wars of the gods at which he had been present, and was so treated as to make him feel that he was somebody in the world of Dublin. Now he was invited to give all this up; and for what?</p><p>He answered that question to himself with enthusiastic eloquence. The reward offered to him was the thing which in all the world he liked best. It was suggested to him that he should again have within his reach that parliamentary renown which had once been the very breath of his nostrils. We all know those arguments and quotations, antagonistic to prudence, with which a man fortifies himself in rashness. &quot;None but the brave deserve the fair.&quot; &quot;Where there&#39;s a will there&#39;s a way.&quot; &quot;Nothing venture nothing have.&quot; &quot;The sword is to him who can use it.&quot; &quot;Fortune favours the bold.&quot; But on the other side there is just as much to be said. &quot;A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.&quot; &quot;Look before you leap.&quot; &quot;Thrust not out your hand further than you can draw it back again.&quot; All which maxims of life Phineas Finn revolved within his own heart, if not carefully, at least frequently, as he walked up and down the long pier of Kingston Harbour.</p><p>But what matter such revolvings? A man placed as was our Phineas always does that which most pleases him at the moment, being but poor at argument if he cannot carry the weight to that side which best satisfies his own feelings. Had not his success been very great when he before made the attempt? Was he not well aware at every moment of his life that, after having so thoroughly learned his lesson in London, he was throwing away his hours amidst his present pursuits in Dublin? Did he not owe himself to his country? And then, again, what might not London do for him? Men who had begun as he begun had lived to rule over Cabinets, and to sway the Empire. He had been happy for a short twelvemonth with his young bride,--for a short twelvemonth,--and then she had been taken from him. Had she been spared to him he would never have longed for more than Fate had given him. He would never have sighed again for the glories of Westminster had his Mary not gone from him. Now he was alone in the world; and, though he could look forward to possible and not improbable events which would make that future disposition of himself a most difficult question for him, still he would dare to try.</p><p>As the first result of Erle&#39;s letter Phineas was over in London early in August. If he went on with this matter, he must, of course, resign the office for holding which he was now paid a thousand a year. He could retain that as long as he chose to earn the money, but the earning of it would not be compatible with a seat in Parliament. He had a few thousand pounds with which he could pay for the contest at Tankerville, for the consequent petition which had been so generously suggested to him, and maintain himself in London for a session or two should he be so fortunate as to carry his election. Then he would be penniless, with the world before him as a closed oyster to be again opened, and he knew,--no one better,--that this oyster becomes harder and harder in the opening as the man who has to open it becomes older. It is an oyster that will close to again with a snap, after you have got your knife well into it, if you withdraw your point but for a moment. He had had a rough tussle with the oyster already, and had reached the fish within the shell. Nevertheless, the oyster which he had got was not the oyster which he wanted. So he told himself now, and here had come to him the chance of trying again.</p><p>Early in August he went over to England, saw Mr. Molescroft, and made his first visit to Tankerville. He did not like the look of Tankerville; but nevertheless he resigned his place before the month was over. That was the one great step, or rather the leap in the dark,--and that he took. Things had been so arranged that the election at Tankerville was to take place on the 20th of October. When the dissolution had been notified to all the world by Mr. Daubeny an earlier day was suggested; but Mr. Daubeny saw reasons for postponing it for a fortnight. Mr. Daubeny&#39;s enemies were again very ferocious. It was all a trick. Mr. Daubeny had no right to continue Prime Minister a day after the decided expression of opinion as to unfitness which had been pronounced by the House of Commons. Men were waxing very wrath. Nevertheless, so much power remained in Mr. Daubeny&#39;s hand, and the election was delayed. That for Tankerville would not be held till the 20th of October. The whole House could not be chosen till the end of the month,--hardly by that time--and yet there was to be an autumn Session. The Ratlers and Bonteens were at any rate clear about the autumn Session. It was absolutely impossible that Mr. Daubeny should be allowed to remain in power over Christmas, and up to February.</p><p>Mr. Molescroft, whom Phineas saw in London, was not a comfortable counsellor. &quot;So you are going down to Tankerville?&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;They seem to think I might as well try.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Quite right;--quite right. Somebody ought to try it, no doubt. It would be a disgrace to the whole party if Browborough were allowed to walk over. There isn&#39;t a borough in England more sure to return a Liberal than Tankerville if left to itself. And yet that lump of a legislator has sat there as a Tory for the last dozen years by dint of money and brass.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think we can unseat him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t say that. He hasn&#39;t come to the end of his money, and as to his brass that is positively without end.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But surely he&#39;ll have some fear of consequences after what has been done?&quot;</p><p>&quot;None in the least. What has been done? Can you name a single Parliamentary aspirant who has been made to suffer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They have suffered in character,&quot; said Phineas. &quot;I should not like to have the things said of me that have been said of them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know a man of them who stands in a worse position among his own friends than he occupied before. And men of that sort don&#39;t want a good position among their enemies. They know they&#39;re safe. When the seat is in dispute everybody is savage enough; but when it is merely a question of punishing a man, what is the use of being savage? Who knows whose turn it may be next?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#39;ll play the old game, then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course he&#39;ll play the old game,&quot; said Mr. Molescroft. &quot;He doesn&#39;t know any other game. All the purists in England wouldn&#39;t teach him to think that a poor man ought not to sell his vote, and that a rich man oughtn&#39;t to buy it. You mean to go in for purity?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly I do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Browborough will think just as badly of you as you will of him. He&#39;ll hate you because he&#39;ll think you are trying to rob him of what he has honestly bought; but he&#39;ll hate you quite as much because you try to rob the borough. He&#39;d tell you if you asked him that he doesn&#39;t want his seat for nothing, any more than he wants his house or his carriage-horses for nothing. To him you&#39;ll be a mean, low interloper. But you won&#39;t care about that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not in the least, if I can get the seat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t. He will be elected. You&#39;ll petition. He&#39;ll lose his seat. There will be a commission. And then the borough will be disfranchised. It&#39;s a fine career, but expensive; and then there is no reward beyond the self-satisfaction arising from a good action. However, Ruddles will do the best he can for you, and it certainly is possible that you may creep through.&quot; This was very disheartening, but Barrington Erle assured our hero that such was Mr. Molescroft&#39;s usual way with candidates, and that it really meant little or nothing. At any rate, Phineas Finn was pledged to stand.</p><p>CHAPTER II.</p><p>HARRINGTON HALL.</p><p>Phineas, on his first arrival in London, found a few of his old friends, men who were still delayed by business though the Session was over. He arrived on the 10th of August, which may be considered as the great day of the annual exodus, and he remembered how he, too, in former times had gone to Scotland to shoot grouse, and what he had done there besides shooting. He had been a welcome guest at Loughlinter, the magnificent seat of Mr. Kennedy, and indeed there had been that between him and Mr. Kennedy which ought to make him a welcome guest there still. But of Mr. Kennedy he had heard nothing directly since he had left London. From Mr. Kennedy&#39;s wife, Lady Laura, who had been his great friend, he had heard occasionally; but she was separated from her husband, and was living abroad with her father, the Earl of Brentford. Has it not been written in a former book how this Lady Laura had been unhappy in her marriage, having wedded herself to a man whom she had never loved, because he was rich and powerful, and how this very Phineas had asked her to be his bride after she had accepted the rich man&#39;s hand? Thence had come great trouble, but nevertheless there had been that between Mr. Kennedy and our hero which made Phineas feel that he ought still to be welcomed as a guest should he show himself at the door of Loughlinter Castle. The idea came upon him simply because he found that almost every man for whom he inquired had just started, or was just starting, for the North; and he would have liked to go where others went. He asked a few questions as to Mr. Kennedy from Barrington Erle and others, who had known him, and was told that the man now lived quite alone. He still kept his seat in Parliament, but had hardly appeared during the last Session, and it was thought that he would not come forward again. Of his life in the country nothing was known. &quot;No one fishes his rivers, or shoots his moors, as far as I can learn,&quot; said Barrington Erle. &quot;I suppose he looks after the sheep and says his prayers, and keeps his money together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And there has been no attempt at a reconciliation?&quot; Phineas asked.</p><p>&quot;She went abroad to escape his attempts, and remains there in order that she may be safe. Of all hatreds that the world produces, a wife&#39;s hatred for her husband, when she does hate him, is the strongest.&quot;</p><p>In September Finn was back in Ireland, and about the end of that month he made his first visit to Tankerville. He remained there for three or four days, and was terribly disgusted while staying at the &quot;Yellow&quot; inn, to find that the people of the town would treat him as though he were rolling in wealth. He was soon tired of Tankerville, and as he could do nothing further, on the spot, till the time for canvassing should come on, about ten days previous to the election, he returned to London, somewhat at a loss to know how to bestir himself. But in London he received a letter from another old friend, which decided him:--</p><p>&quot;My dear Mr. Finn,&quot; said the letter,</p><p>of course you know that Oswald is now master of the Brake hounds. Upon my word, I think it is the place in the world for which he is most fit. He is a great martinet in the field, and works at it as though it were for his bread. We have been here looking after the kennels and getting up the horses since the beginning of August, and have been cub-hunting ever so long. Oswald wants to know whether you won&#39;t come down to him till the election begins in earnest.</p><p>We were so glad to hear that you were going to appear again. I have always known that it would be so. I have told Oswald scores of times that I was sure you would never be happy out of Parliament, and that your real home must be somewhere near the Treasury Chambers. You can&#39;t alter a man&#39;s nature. Oswald was born to be a master of hounds, and you were born to be a Secretary of State. He works the hardest and gets the least pay for it; but then, as he says, he does not run so great a risk of being turned out.</p><p>We haven&#39;t much of a house, but we have plenty of room for you. As for the house, it was a matter of course, whether good or bad. It goes with the kennels, and I should as little think of having a choice as though I were one of the horses. We have very good stables, and such a stud! I can&#39;t tell you how many there are. In October it seems as though their name were legion. In March there is never anything for any body to ride on. I generally find then that mine are taken for the whips. Do come and take advantage of the flush. I can&#39;t tell you how glad we shall be to see you. Oswald ought to have written himself, but he says--; I won&#39;t tell you what he says. We shall take no refusal. You can have nothing to do before you are wanted at Tankerville.</p><p>I was so sorry to hear of your great loss. I hardly know whether to mention it or to be silent in writing. If you were here of course I should speak of her. And I would rather renew your grief for a time than allow you to think that I am indifferent. Pray come to us.</p><p>Yours ever most sincerely,</p><p>VIOLET CHILTERN.</p><p>Harrington Hall, Wednesday.</p><p>Phineas Finn at once made up his mind that he would go to Harrington Hall. There was the prospect in this of an immediate return to some of the most charming pleasures of the old life, which was very grateful to him. It pleased him much that he should have been so thought of by this lady,--that she should have sought him out at once, at the moment of his reappearance. That she would have remembered him, he was quite sure, and that her husband, Lord Chiltern, should remember him also, was beyond a doubt. There had been passages in their joint lives which people cannot forget. But it might so well have been the case that they should not have cared to renew their acquaintance with him. As it was, they must have made close inquiry, and had sought him at the first day of his reappearance. The letter had reached him through the hands of Barrington Erle, who was a cousin of Lord Chiltern, and was at once answered as follows:--</p><p>Fowler&#39;s Hotel, Jermyn Street, October 1st.</p><p>MY DEAR LADY CHILTERN,</p><p>I cannot tell you how much pleasure the very sight of your handwriting gave me. Yes, here I am again, trying my hand at the old game. They say that you can never cure a gambler or a politician; and, though I had very much to make me happy till that great blow came upon me, I believe that it is so. I am uneasy till I can see once more the Speaker&#39;s wig, and hear bitter things said of this &quot;right honourable gentleman,&quot; and of that noble friend. I want to be once more in the midst of it; and as I have been left singularly desolate in the world, without a tie by which I am bound to aught but an honourable mode of living, I have determined to run the risk, and have thrown up the place which I held under Government. I am to stand for Tankerville, as you have heard, and I am told by those to whose tender mercies I have been confided by B. E. that I have not a chance of success.</p><p>Your invitation is so tempting that I cannot refuse it. As you say, I have nothing to do till the play begins. I have issued my address, and must leave my name and my fame to be discussed by the Tankervillians till I make my appearance among them on the 10th of this month. Of course, I had heard that Chiltern has the Brake, and I have heard also that he is doing it uncommonly well. Tell him that I have hardly seen a hound since the memorable day on which I pulled him out from under his horse in the brook at Wissindine. I don&#39;t know whether I can ride a yard now. I will get to you on the 4th, and will remain if you will keep me till the 9th. If Chiltern can put me up on anything a little quieter than Bonebreaker, I&#39;ll go out steadily, and see how he does his cubbing. I may, perhaps, be justified in opining that Bonebreaker has before this left the establishment. If so I may, perhaps, find myself up to a little very light work.</p><p>Remember me very kindly to him. Does he make a good nurse with the baby?</p><p>Yours, always faithfully,</p><p>PHINEAS FINN.</p><p>I cannot tell you with what pleasure I look forward to seeing you both again.</p><p>The next few days went very heavily with him. There had, indeed, been no real reason why he should not have gone to Harrington Hall at once, except that he did not wish to seem to be utterly homeless. And yet were he there, with his old friends, he would not scruple for a moment in owning that such was the case. He had fixed his day, however, and did remain in London till the 4th. Barrington Erle and Mr. Ratler he saw occasionally, for they were kept in town on the affairs of the election. The one was generally full of hope; but the other was no better than a Job&#39;s comforter. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t advise you to expect too much at Tankerville, you know,&quot; said Mr. Ratler.</p><p>&quot;By no means,&quot; said Phineas, who had always disliked Ratler, and had known himself to be disliked in return. &quot;I expect nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Browborough understands such a place as Tankerville so well! He has been at it all his life. Money is no object to him, and he doesn&#39;t care a straw what anybody says of him. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to unseat him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ll try at least,&quot; said Phineas, upon whom, however, such remarks as these cast a gloom which he could not succeed in shaking off, though he could summon vigour sufficient to save him from showing the gloom. He knew very well that comfortable words would be spoken to him at Harrington Hall, and that then the gloom would go. The comforting words of his friends would mean quite as little as the discourtesies of Mr. Ratler. He understood that thoroughly, and felt that he ought to hold a stronger control over his own impulses. He must take the thing as it would come, and neither the flatterings of friends nor the threatenings of enemies could alter it; but he knew his own weakness, and confessed to himself that another week of life by himself at Fowler&#39;s Hotel, refreshed by occasional interviews with Mr. Ratler, would make him altogether unfit for the coming contest at Tankerville.</p><p>He reached Harrington Hall in the afternoon about four, and found Lady Chiltern alone. As soon as he saw her he told himself that she was not in the least altered since he had last been with her, and yet during the period she had undergone that great change which turns a girl into a mother. She had the baby with her when he came into the room, and at once greeted him as an old friend,--as a loved and loving friend who was to be made free at once to all the inmost privileges of real friendship, which are given to and are desired by so few. &quot;Yes, here we are again,&quot; said Lady Chiltern, &quot;settled, as far as I suppose we ever shall be settled, for ever so many years to come. The place belongs to old Lord Gunthorpe, I fancy, but really I hardly know. I do know that we should give it up at once if we gave up the hounds, and that we can&#39;t be turned out as long as we have them. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd to have to depend on a lot of yelping dogs?&quot;</p><p>[Illustration: Lady Chiltern and her baby.]</p><p>&quot;Only that the yelping dogs depend on you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a kind of give and take, I suppose, like other things in the world. Of course, he&#39;s a beautiful baby. I had him in just that you might see him. I show Baby, and Oswald shows the hounds. We&#39;ve nothing else to interest anybody. But nurse shall take him now. Come out and have a turn in the shrubbery before Oswald comes back. They&#39;re gone to-day as far as Trumpeton Wood, out of which no fox was ever known to break, and they won&#39;t be home till six.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who are &#39;they&#39;?&quot; asked Phineas, as he took his hat.</p><p>&quot;The &#39;they&#39; is only Adelaide Palliser. I don&#39;t think you ever knew her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never. Is she anything to the other Pallisers?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She is everything to them all; niece and grand-niece, and first cousin and grand-daughter. Her father was the fourth brother, and as she was one of six her share of the family wealth is small. Those Pallisers are very peculiar, and I doubt whether she ever saw the old duke. She has no father or mother, and lives when she is at home with a married sister, about seventy years older than herself, Mrs. Attenbury.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I remember Mrs. Attenbury.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course you do. Who does not? Adelaide was a child then, I suppose. Though I don&#39;t know why she should have been, as she calls herself one-and-twenty now. You&#39;ll think her pretty. I don&#39;t. But she is my great new friend, and I like her immensely. She rides to hounds, and talks Italian, and writes for the <em>Times</em>.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Writes for the <em>Times</em>!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I won&#39;t swear that she does, but she could. There&#39;s only one other thing about her. She&#39;s engaged to be married.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To whom?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know that I shall answer that question, and indeed I&#39;m not sure that she is engaged. But there&#39;s a man dying for her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You must know, if she&#39;s your friend.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course I know; but there are ever so many ins and outs, and I ought not to have said a word about it. I shouldn&#39;t have done so to any one but you. And now we&#39;ll go in and have some tea, and go to bed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go to bed!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We always go to bed here before dinner on hunting days. When the cubbing began Oswald used to be up at three.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t get up at three now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nevertheless we go to bed. You needn&#39;t if you don&#39;t like, and I&#39;ll stay with you if you choose till you dress for dinner. I did know so well that you&#39;d come back to London, Mr. Finn. You are not a bit altered.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I feel to be changed in everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why should you be altered? It&#39;s only two years. I am altered because of Baby. That does change a woman. Of course I&#39;m thinking always of what he will do in the world; whether he&#39;ll be a master of hounds or a Cabinet Minister or a great farmer;--or perhaps a miserable spendthrift, who will let everything that his grandfathers and grandmothers have done for him go to the dogs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why do you think of anything so wretched, Lady Chiltern?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who can help thinking? Men do do so. It seems to me that that is the line of most young men who come to their property early. Why should I dare to think that my boy should be better than others? But I do; and I fancy that he will be a great statesman. After all, Mr. Finn, that is the best thing that a man can be, unless it is given him to be a saint and a martyr and all that kind of thing,--which is not just what a mother looks for.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That would only be better than the spendthrift and gambler.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hardly better you&#39;ll say, perhaps. How odd that is! We all profess to believe when we&#39;re told that this world should be used merely as a preparation for the next; and yet there is something so cold and comfortless in the theory that we do not relish the prospect even for our children. I fancy your people have more real belief in it than ours.&quot;</p><p>Now Phineas Finn was a Roman Catholic. But the discussion was stopped by the noise of an arrival in the hall.</p><p>&quot;There they are,&quot; said Lady Chiltern; &quot;Oswald never comes in without a sound of trumpets to make him audible throughout the house.&quot; Then she went to meet her husband, and Phineas followed her out of the drawing-room.</p><p>Lord Chiltern was as glad to see him as she had been, and in a very few minutes he found himself quite at home. In the hall he was introduced to Miss Palliser, but he was hardly able to see her as she stood there a moment in her hat and habit. There was ever so much said about the day&#39;s work. The earths had not been properly stopped, and Lord Chiltern had been very angry, and the owner of Trumpeton Wood, who was a great duke, had been much abused, and things had not gone altogether straight.</p><p>&quot;Lord Chiltern was furious,&quot; said Miss Palliser, laughing, &quot;and therefore, of course, I became furious too, and swore that it was an awful shame. Then they all swore that it was an awful shame, and everybody was furious. And you might hear one man saying to another all day long, &#39;By George, this is too bad.&#39; But I never could quite make out what was amiss, and I&#39;m sure the men didn&#39;t know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What was it, Oswald?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never mind now. One doesn&#39;t go to Trumpeton Wood expecting to be happy there. I&#39;ve half a mind to swear I&#39;ll never draw it again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve been asking him what was the matter all the way home,&quot; said Miss Palliser, &quot;but I don&#39;t think he knows himself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come upstairs, Phineas, and I&#39;ll show you your room,&quot; said Lord Chiltern. &quot;It&#39;s not quite as comfortable as the old &#39;Bull,&#39; but we make it do.&quot;</p><p>Phineas, when he was alone, could not help standing for awhile with his back to the fire thinking of it all. He did already feel himself to be at home in that house, and his doing so was a contradiction to all the wisdom which he had been endeavouring to teach himself for the last two years. He had told himself over and over again that that life which he had lived in London had been, if not a dream, at any rate not more significant than a parenthesis in his days, which, as of course it had no bearing on those which had gone before, so neither would it influence those which were to follow. The dear friends of that period of feverish success would for the future be to him as--nothing. That was the lesson of wisdom which he had endeavoured to teach himself, and the facts of the last two years had seemed to show that the lesson was a true lesson. He had disappeared from among his former companions, and had heard almost nothing from them. From neither Lord Chiltern or his wife had he received any tidings. He had expected to receive none,--had known that in the common course of things none was to be expected. There were many others with whom he had been intimate--Barrington Erle, Laurence Fitzgibbon, Mr. Monk, a politician who had been in the Cabinet, and in consequence of whose political teaching he, Phineas Finn, had banished himself from the political world;--from none of these had he received a line till there came that letter summoning him back to the battle. There had never been a time during his late life in Dublin at which he had complained to himself that on this account his former friends had forgotten him. If they had not written to him, neither had he written to them. But on his first arrival in England he had, in the sadness of his solitude, told himself that he was forgotten. There would be no return, so he feared, of those pleasant intimacies which he now remembered so well, and which, as he remembered them, were so much more replete with unalloyed delights than they had ever been in their existing realities. And yet here he was, a welcome guest in Lord Chiltern&#39;s house, a welcome guest in Lady Chiltern&#39;s drawing-room, and quite as much at home with them as ever he had been in the old days.</p><p>Who is there that can write letters to all his friends, or would not find it dreary work to do so even in regard to those whom he really loves? When there is something palpable to be said, what a blessing is the penny post! To one&#39;s wife, to one&#39;s child, one&#39;s mistress, one&#39;s steward if there be a steward; one&#39;s gamekeeper, if there be shooting forward; one&#39;s groom, if there be hunting; one&#39;s publisher, if there be a volume ready or money needed; or one&#39;s tailor occasionally, if a coat be required, a man is able to write. But what has a man to say to his friend,--or, for that matter, what has a woman? A Horace Walpole may write to a Mr. Mann about all things under the sun, London gossip or transcendental philosophy, and if the Horace Walpole of the occasion can write well and will labour diligently at that vocation, his letters may be worth reading by his Mr. Mann, and by others; but, for the maintenance of love and friendship, continued correspondence between distant friends is naught. Distance in time and place, but especially in time, will diminish friendship. It is a rule of nature that it should be so, and thus the friendships which a man most fosters are those which he can best enjoy. If your friend leave you, and seek a residence in Patagonia, make a niche for him in your memory, and keep him there as warm as you may. Perchance he may return from Patagonia and the old joys may be repeated. But never think that those joys can be maintained by the assistance of ocean postage, let it be at never so cheap a rate. Phineas Finn had not thought this matter out very carefully, and now, after two years of absence, he was surprised to find that he was still had in remembrance by those who had never troubled themselves to write to him a line during his absence.</p><p>When he went down into the drawing-room he was surprised to find another old friend sitting there alone. &quot;Mr. Finn,&quot; said the old lady, &quot;I hope I see you quite well. I am glad to meet you again. You find my niece much changed, I dare say?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not in the least, Lady Baldock,&quot; said Phineas, seizing the proffered hand of the dowager. In that hour of conversation, which they had had together, Lady Chiltern had said not a word to Phineas of her aunt, and now he felt himself to be almost discomposed by the meeting. &quot;Is your daughter here, Lady Baldock?&quot;</p><p>Lady Baldock shook her head solemnly and sadly. &quot;Do not speak of her, Mr. Finn. It is too sad! We never mention her name now.&quot; Phineas looked as sad as he knew how to look, but he said nothing. The lamentation of the mother did not seem to imply that the daughter was dead; and, from his remembrance of Augusta Boreham, he would have thought her to be the last woman in the world to run away with the coachman. At the moment there did not seem to be any other sufficient cause for so melancholy a wagging of that venerable head. He had been told to say nothing, and he could ask no questions; but Lady Baldock did not choose that he should be left to imagine things more terrible than the truth. &quot;She is lost to us for ever, Mr. Finn.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How very sad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sad, indeed! We don&#39;t know how she took it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Took what, Lady Baldock?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am sure it was nothing that she ever saw at home. If there is a thing I&#39;m true to, it is the Protestant Established Church of England. Some nasty, low, lying, wheedling priest got hold of her, and now she&#39;s a nun, and calls herself--Sister Veronica John!&quot; Lady Baldock threw great strength and unction into her description of the priest; but as soon as she had told her story a sudden thought struck her. &quot;Oh, laws! I quite forgot. I beg your pardon, Mr. Finn; but you&#39;re one of them!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not a nun, Lady Baldock.&quot; At that moment the door was opened, and Lord Chiltern came in, to the great relief of his wife&#39;s aunt.</p><p>CHAPTER III.</p><p>GERARD MAULE.</p><p>&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; said Phineas that night after Lady Baldock was gone to bed. The two men had taken off their dress coats, and had put on smoking caps,--Lord Chiltern, indeed, having clothed himself in a wonderful Chinese dressing-gown, and they were sitting round the fire in the smoking-room; but though they were thus employed and thus dressed the two younger ladies were still with them.</p><p>&quot;How could I tell you everything in two minutes?&quot; said Lady Chiltern.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d have given a guinea to have heard her,&quot; said Lord Chiltern, getting up and rubbing his hands as he walked about the room. &quot;Can&#39;t you fancy all that she&#39;d say, and then her horror when she&#39;d remember that Phineas was a Papist himself?&quot;</p><p>&quot;But what made Miss Boreham turn nun?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I fancy she found the penances lighter than they were at home,&quot; said the lord. &quot;They couldn&#39;t well be heavier.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dear old aunt!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Does she never go to see Sister Veronica?&quot; asked Miss Palliser.</p><p>&quot;She has been once,&quot; said Lady Chiltern.</p><p>&quot;And fumigated herself first so as to escape infection,&quot; said the husband. &quot;You should hear Gerard Maule imitate her when she talks about the filthy priest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And who is Gerard Maule?&quot; Then Lady Chiltern looked at her friend, and Phineas was almost sure that Gerard Maule was the man who was dying for Adelaide Palliser.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s a great ally of mine,&quot; said Lady Chiltern.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s a young fellow who thinks he can ride to hounds,&quot; said Lord Chiltern, &quot;and who very often does succeed in riding over them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s not fair, Lord Chiltern,&quot; said Miss Palliser.</p><p>&quot;Just my idea of it,&quot; replied the Master. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s at all fair. Because a man has plenty of horses, and nothing else to do, and rides twelve stone, and doesn&#39;t care how he&#39;s sworn at, he&#39;s always to be over the scent, and spoil every one&#39;s sport. I don&#39;t call it at all fair.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s a very nice fellow, and a great friend of Oswald&#39;s. He is to be here to-morrow, and you&#39;ll like him very much. Won&#39;t he, Adelaide?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know Mr. Finn&#39;s tastes quite so well as you do, Violet. But Mr. Maule is so harmless that no one can dislike him very much.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As for being harmless, I&#39;m not so sure,&quot; said Lady Chiltern. After that they all went to bed.</p><p>Phineas remained at Harrington Hall till the ninth, on which day he went to London so that he might be at Tankerville on the tenth. He rode Lord Chiltern&#39;s horses, and took an interest in the hounds, and nursed the baby. &quot;Now tell me what you think of Gerard Maule,&quot; Lady Chiltern asked him, the day before he started.</p><p>&quot;I presume that he is the young man that is dying for Miss Palliser.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You may answer my question, Mr. Finn, without making any such suggestion.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not discreetly. Of course if he is to be made happy, I am bound at the present moment to say all good things of him. At such a crisis it would be wicked to tinge Miss Palliser&#39;s hopes with any hue less warm than rose colour.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you suppose that I tell everything that is said to me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not at all; but opinions do ooze out. I take him to be a good sort of a fellow; but why doesn&#39;t he talk a bit more?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s just it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And why does he pretend to do nothing? When he&#39;s out he rides hard; but at other times there&#39;s a ha-ha, lack a-daisical air about him which I hate. Why men assume it I never could understand. It can recommend them to nobody. A man can&#39;t suppose that he&#39;ll gain anything by pretending that he never reads, and never thinks, and never does anything, and never speaks, and doesn&#39;t care what he has for dinner, and, upon the whole, would just as soon lie in bed all day as get up. It isn&#39;t that he is really idle. He rides and eats, and does get up, and I daresay talks and thinks. It&#39;s simply a poor affectation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s your rose colour, is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;ve promised secrecy, Lady Chiltern. I suppose he&#39;s well off?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is an eldest son. The property is not large, and I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s something wrong about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He has no profession?&quot;</p><p>&quot;None at all. He has an allowance of L800 a year, which in some sort of fashion is independent of his father. He has nothing on earth to do. Adelaide&#39;s whole fortune is four thousand pounds. If they were to marry what would become of them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That wouldn&#39;t be enough to live on?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It ought to be enough,--as he must, I suppose, have the property some day,--if only he had something to do. What sort of a life would he lead?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suppose he couldn&#39;t become a Master of Hounds?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is ill-natured, Mr. Finn.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did not mean it so. I did not indeed. You must know that I did not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course Oswald had nothing to do, and, of course, there was a time when I wished that he should take to Parliament. No one knew all that better than you did. But he was very different from Mr. Maule.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very different, indeed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oswald is a man full of energy, and with no touch of that affectation which you described. As it is, he does work hard. No man works harder. The learned people say that you should produce something, and I don&#39;t suppose that he produces much. But somebody must keep hounds, and nobody could do it better than he does.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t think that I meant to blame him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I hope not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are he and his father on good terms now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes. His father wishes him to go to Saulsby, but he won&#39;t do that. He hates Saulsby.&quot;</p><p>Saulsby was the country seat of the Earl of Brentford, the name of the property which must some day belong to this Lord Chiltern, and Phineas, as he heard this, remembered former days in which he had ridden about Saulsby Woods, and had thought them to be anything but hateful. &quot;Is Saulsby shut up?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;Altogether, and so is the house in Portman Square. There never was anything more sad or desolate. You would find him altered, Mr. Finn. He is quite an old man now. He was here in the spring, for a week or two;--in England, that is; but he stayed at an hotel in London. He and Laura live at Dresden now, and a very sad time they must have.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Does she write?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes; and keeps up all her interest about politics. I have already told her that you are to stand for Tankerville. No one,--no other human being in the world will be so interested for you as she is. If any friend ever felt an interest almost selfish for a friend&#39;s welfare, she will feel such an interest for you. If you were to succeed it would give her a hope in life.&quot; Phineas sat silent, drinking in the words that were said to him. Though they were true, or at least meant to be true, they were full of flattery. Why should this woman of whom they were speaking love him so dearly? She was nothing to him. She was highly born, greatly gifted, wealthy, and a married woman, whose character, as he well knew, was beyond the taint of suspicion, though she had been driven by the hard sullenness of her husband to refuse to live under his roof. Phineas Finn and Lady Laura Kennedy had not seen each other for two years, and when they had parted, though they had lived as friends, there had been no signs of still living friendship. True, indeed, she had written to him, but her letters had been short and cold, merely detailing certain circumstances of her outward life. Now he was told by this woman&#39;s dearest friend that his welfare was closer to her heart than any other interest!</p><p>&quot;I daresay you often think of her?&quot; said Lady Chiltern.</p><p>&quot;Indeed, I do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What virtues she used to ascribe to you! What sins she forgave you! How hard she fought for you! Now, though she can fight no more, she does not think of it all the less.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Poor Lady Laura!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Poor Laura, indeed! When one sees such shipwreck it makes a woman doubt whether she ought to marry at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And yet he was a good man. She always said so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Men are so seldom really good. They are so little sympathetic. What man thinks of changing himself so as to suit his wife? And yet men expect that women shall put on altogether new characters when they are married, and girls think that they can do so. Look at this Mr. Maule, who is really over head and ears in love with Adelaide Palliser. She is full of hope and energy. He has none. And yet he has the effrontery to suppose that she will adapt herself to his way of living if he marries her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then they are to be married?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suppose it will come to that. It always does if the man is in earnest. Girls will accept men simply because they think it ill-natured to return the compliment of an offer with a hearty &#39;No.&#39;&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suppose she likes him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course she does. A girl almost always likes a man who is in love with her,--unless indeed she positively dislikes him. But why should she like him? He is good-looking, is a gentleman, and not a fool. Is that enough to make such a girl as Adelaide Palliser think a man divine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is nobody to be accepted who is not credited with divinity?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The man should be a demigod, at least in respect to some part of his character. I can find nothing even demi-divine about Mr. Maule.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s because you are not in love with him, Lady Chiltern.&quot;</p><p>Six or seven very pleasant days Phineas Finn spent at Harrington Hall, and then he started alone, and very lonely, for Tankerville. But he admitted to himself that the pleasure which he had received during his visit was quite sufficient to qualify him in running any risk in an attempt to return to the kind of life which he had formerly led. But if he should fail at Tankerville what would become of him then?</p><p>CHAPTER IV.</p><p>TANKERVILLE.</p><p>The great Mr. Molescroft himself came over to Tankerville for the purpose of introducing our hero to the electors and to Mr. Ruddles, the local Liberal agent, who was to be employed. They met at the Lambton Arms, and there Phineas established himself, knowing well that he had before him ten days of unmitigated vexation and misery. Tankerville was a dirty, prosperous, ungainly town, which seemed to exude coal-dust or coal-mud at every pore. It was so well recognised as being dirty that people did not expect to meet each other with clean hands and faces. Linen was never white at Tankerville, and even ladies who sat in drawing-rooms were accustomed to the feel and taste and appearance of soot in all their daintiest recesses. We hear that at Oil City the flavour of petroleum is hardly considered to be disagreeable, and so it was with the flavour of coal at Tankerville. And we know that at Oil City the flavour of petroleum must not be openly declared to be objectionable, and so it was with coal at Tankerville. At Tankerville coal was much loved, and was not thought to be dirty. Mr. Ruddles was very much begrimed himself, and some of the leading Liberal electors, upon whom Phineas Finn had already called, seemed to be saturated with the product of the district. It would not, however, in any event be his duty to live at Tankerville, and he had believed from the first moment of his entrance into the town that he would soon depart from it, and know it no more. He felt that the chance of his being elected was quite a forlorn hope, and could hardly understand why he had allowed himself to be embarrassed by so very unprofitable a speculation.</p><p>Phineas Finn had thrice before this been chosen to sit in Parliament--twice for the Irish borough of Loughshane, and once for the English borough of Loughton; but he had been so happy as hitherto to have known nothing of the miseries and occasional hopelessness of a contested election. At Loughton he had come forward as the nominee of the Earl of Brentford, and had been returned without any chance of failure by that nobleman&#39;s influence. At Loughshane things had nearly been as pleasant with him. He had almost been taught to think that nothing could be easier than getting into Parliament if only a man could live when he was there. But Loughton and Loughshane were gone, with so many other comfortable things of old days, and now he found himself relegated to a borough to which, as it seemed to him, he was sent to fight, not that he might win, but because it was necessary to his party that the seat should not be allowed to be lost without fighting. He had had the pleasant things of parliamentary adventure, and now must undergo those which were unpleasant. No doubt he could have refused, but he had listened to the tempter, and could not now go back, though Mr. Ruddles was hardly more encouraging than Mr. Molescroft.</p><p>&quot;Browborough has been at work for the last three days,&quot; said Mr. Ruddles, in a tone of reproach. Mr. Ruddles had always thought that no amount of work could be too heavy for his candidates.</p><p>&quot;Will that make much difference?&quot; asked Mr. Molescroft.</p><p>&quot;Well, it does. Of course, he has been among the colliers,--when we ought to have been before him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I came when I was told,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d have telegraphed to you if I&#39;d known where you were. But there&#39;s no help for spilt milk. We must get to work now,--that&#39;s all. I suppose you&#39;re for disestablishing the Church?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not particularly,&quot; said Phineas, who felt that with him, as a Roman Catholic, this was a delicate subject.</p><p>&quot;We needn&#39;t go into that, need we?&quot; said Mr. Molescroft, who, though a Liberal, was a good Churchman.</p><p>Mr. Ruddles was a Dissenter, but the very strong opinion which Mr. Ruddles now expressed as to the necessity that the new candidate should take up the Church question did not spring at all from his own religious convictions. His present duty called upon him to have a Liberal candidate if possible returned for the borough with which he was connected, and not to disseminate the doctrines of his own sect. Nevertheless, his opinion was very strong. &quot;I think we must, Mr. Molescroft,&quot; said he; &quot;I&#39;m sure we must. Browborough has taken up the other side. He went to church last Sunday with the Mayor and two of the Aldermen, and I&#39;m told he said all the responses louder than anybody else. He dined with the Vicar of Trinity on Monday. He has been very loud in denouncing Mr. Finn as a Roman Catholic, and has declared that everything will be up with the State if Tankerville returns a friend and supporter of the Pope. You&#39;ll find that the Church will be the cry here this election. You can&#39;t get anything by supporting it, but you may make a strong party by pledging yourself to disendowment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t local taxation do?&quot; asked Mr. Molescroft, who indeed preferred almost any other reform to disendowment.</p><p>&quot;I have made up my mind that we must have some check on municipal expenditure,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;It won&#39;t do--not alone. If I understand the borough, the feeling at this election will altogether be about the Church. You see, Mr. Finn, your being a Roman Catholic gives them a handle, and they&#39;re already beginning to use it. They don&#39;t like Roman Catholics here; but if you can manage to give it a sort of Liberal turn,--as many of your constituents used to do, you know,--as though you disliked Church and State rather than cared for the Pope, may be it might act on our side rather than on theirs. Mr. Molescroft understands it all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes; I understand.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Ruddles said a great deal more to the same effect, and though Mr. Molescroft did not express any acquiescence in these views, neither did he dissent. The candidate said but little at this interview, but turned the matter over in his mind. A seat in Parliament would be but a barren honour, and he could not afford to offer his services for barren honour. Honest political work he was anxious to do, but for what work he did he desired to be paid. The party to which he belonged had, as he knew, endeavoured to avoid the subject of the disendowment of the Church of England. It is the necessary nature of a political party in this country to avoid, as long as it can be avoided, the consideration of any question which involves a great change. There is a consciousness on the minds of leading politicians that the pressure from behind, forcing upon them great measures, drives them almost quicker than they can go, so that it becomes a necessity with them to resist rather than to aid the pressure which will certainly be at last effective by its own strength. The best carriage horses are those which can most steadily hold back against the coach as it trundles down the hill. All this Phineas knew, and was of opinion that the Barrington Erles and Ratlers of his party would not thank him for ventilating a measure which, however certain might be its coming, might well be postponed for a few years. Once already in his career he had chosen to be in advance of his party, and the consequences had been disastrous to him. On that occasion his feelings had been strong in regard to the measure upon which he broke away from his party; but, when he first thought of it, he did not care much about Church disendowment.</p><p>But he found that he must needs go as he was driven or else depart out of the place. He wrote a line to his friend Erle, not to ask advice, but to explain the circumstances. &quot;My only possible chance of success will lie in attacking the Church endowments. Of course I think they are bad, and of course I think that they must go. But I have never cared for the matter, and would have been very willing to leave it among those things which will arrange themselves. But I have no choice here.&quot; And so he prepared himself to run his race on the course arranged for him by Mr. Ruddles. Mr. Molescroft, whose hours were precious, soon took his leave, and Phineas Finn was placarded about the town as the sworn foe to all Church endowments.</p><p>In the course of his canvass, and the commotions consequent upon it, he found that Mr. Ruddles was right. No other subject seemed at the moment to have any attraction in Tankerville. Mr. Browborough, whose life had not been passed in any strict obedience to the Ten Commandments, and whose religious observances had not hitherto interfered with either the pleasures or the duties of his life, repeated at every meeting which he attended, and almost to every elector whom he canvassed, the great Shibboleth which he had now adopted--&quot;The prosperity of England depends on the Church of her people.&quot; He was not an orator. Indeed, it might be hard to find a man, who had for years been conversant with public life, less able to string a few words together for immediate use. Nor could he learn half-a-dozen sentences by rote. But he could stand up with unabashed brow and repeat with enduring audacity the same words a dozen times over--&quot;The prosperity of England depends on the Church of her people.&quot; Had he been asked whether the prosperity which he promised was temporal or spiritual in its nature, not only could he not have answered, but he would not in the least have understood the question. But the words as they came from his mouth had a weight which seemed to ensure their truth, and many men in Tankerville thought that Mr. Browborough was eloquent.</p><p>Phineas, on the other hand, made two or three great speeches every evening, and astonished even Mr. Ruddles by his oratory. He had accepted Mr. Ruddles&#39;s proposition with but lukewarm acquiescence, but in the handling of the matter he became zealous, fiery, and enthusiastic. He explained to his hearers with gracious acknowledgment that Church endowments had undoubtedly been most beneficent in past times. He spoke in the interests of no special creed. Whether in the so-called Popish days of Henry VIII and his ancestors, or in the so-called Protestant days that had followed, the state of society had required that spiritual teaching should be supplied from funds fixed and devoted to the purpose. The increasing intelligence and population of the country made this no longer desirable,--or, if desirable, no longer possible. Could these endowments be increased to meet the needs of the increasing millions? Was it not the fact that even among members of the Church of England they were altogether inefficient to supply the wants of our great towns? Did the people of Tankerville believe that the clergymen of London, of Liverpool, and of Manchester were paid by endowments? The arguments which had been efficacious in Ireland must be efficacious in England. He said this without reference to one creed or to another. He did believe in religious teaching. He had not a word to say against a Protestant Episcopal Church. But he thought, nay he was sure, that Church and State, as combined institutions, could no longer prevail in this country. If the people of Tankerville would return him to Parliament it should be his first object to put an end to this anomaly.</p><p>The Browboroughites were considerably astonished by his success. The colliers on this occasion did not seem to regard the clamour that was raised against Irish Papists. Much dirt was thrown and some heads were broken; but Phineas persevered. Mr. Ruddles was lost in admiration. They had never before had at Tankerville a man who could talk so well. Mr. Browborough without ceasing repeated his well-worn assurance, and it was received with the loudest exclamations of delight by his own party. The clergymen of the town and neighbourhood crowded round him and pursued him, and almost seemed to believe in him. They were at any rate fighting their battle as best they knew how to fight it. But the great body of the colliers listened to Phineas, and every collier was now a voter. Then Mr. Ruddles, who had many eyes, began to perceive that the old game was to be played. &quot;There&#39;ll be money going to-morrow after all,&quot; he whispered to Finn the evening before the election.</p><p>&quot;I suppose you expected that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure. They began by thinking they could do without it. They don&#39;t want to sacrifice the borough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nor do I, Mr. Ruddles.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But they&#39;ll sooner do that than lose the seat. A couple of dozen of men out of the Fallgate would make us safe.&quot; Mr. Ruddles smiled as he said this.</p><p>And Phineas smiled as he answered, &quot;If any good can be done by talking to the men at the Fallgate, I&#39;ll talk to them by the hour together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ve about done all that,&quot; said Mr. Ruddles.</p><p>Then came the voting. Up to two o&#39;clock the polling was so equal that the numbers at Mr. Browborough&#39;s committee room were always given in his favour, and those at the Liberal room in favour of Phineas Finn. At three o&#39;clock Phineas was acknowledged to be ten ahead. He himself was surprised at his own success, and declared to himself that his old luck had not deserted him.</p><p>&quot;They&#39;re giving L2 10_s._ a vote at the Fallgate this minute,&quot; said Ruddles to him at a quarter-past three.</p><p>&quot;We shall have to prove it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We can do that, I think,&quot; said Ruddles.</p><p>At four o&#39;clock, when the poll was over, Browborough was declared to have won on the post by seven votes. He was that same evening declared by the Mayor to have been elected sitting member for the borough, and he again assured the people in his speech that the prosperity of England depends on the Church of her people.</p><p>&quot;We shall carry the seat on a scrutiny as sure as eggs,&quot; said Mr. Ruddles, who had been quite won by the gallant way in which Phineas had fought his battle.</p><p>CHAPTER V.</p><p>MR. DAUBENY&#39;S GREAT MOVE.</p><p>The whole Liberal party was taken very much by surprise at the course which the election ran. Or perhaps it might be more proper to say that the parliamentary leaders of the party were surprised. It had not been recognised by them as necessary that the great question of Church and State should be generally discussed on this occasion. It was a matter of course that it should be discussed at some places, and by some men. Eager Dissenters would, of course, take advantage of the opportunity to press their views, and no doubt the entire abolition of the Irish Church as a State establishment had taught Liberals to think and Conservatives to fear that the question would force itself forward at no very distant date. But it had not been expected to do so now. The general incompetence of a Ministry who could not command a majority on any measure was intended to be the strong point of the Liberal party, not only at the election, but at the meeting of Parliament. The Church question, which was necessarily felt by all statesmen to be of such magnitude as to dwarf every other, was not wanted as yet. It might remain in the background as the future standing-point for some great political struggle, in which it would be again necessary that every Liberal should fight, as though for life, with his teeth and nails. Men who ten years since regarded almost with abhorrence, and certainly with distrust, the idea of disruption between Church and State in England, were no doubt learning to perceive that such disruption must come, and were reconciling themselves to it after that slow, silent, inargumentative fashion in which convictions force themselves among us. And from reconciliation to the idea some were advancing to enthusiasm on its behalf. &quot;It is only a question of time,&quot; was now said by many who hardly remembered how devoted they had been to the Established Church of England a dozen years ago. But the fruit was not yet ripe, and the leaders of the Liberal party by no means desired that it should be plucked. They were, therefore, surprised, and but little pleased, when they found that the question was more discussed than any other on the hustings of enthusiastically political boroughs.</p><p>Barrington Erle was angry when he received the letter of Phineas Finn. He was at that moment staying with the Duke of St. Bungay, who was regarded by many as the only possible leader of the Liberal party, should Mr. Gresham for any reason fail them. Indeed the old Whigs, of whom Barrington Erle considered himself to be one, would have much preferred the Duke to Mr. Gresham, had it been possible to set Mr. Gresham aside. But Mr. Gresham was too strong to be set aside; and Erle and the Duke, with all their brethren, were minded to be thoroughly loyal to their leader. He was their leader, and not to be loyal was, in their minds, treachery. But occasionally they feared that the man would carry them whither they did not desire to go. In the meantime heavy things were spoken of our poor friend, Finn.</p><p>&quot;After all, that man is an ass,&quot; said Erle.</p><p>&quot;If so, I believe you are altogether responsible for him,&quot; said the Duke.</p><p>&quot;Well, yes, in a measure; but not altogether. That, however, is a long story. He has many good gifts. He is clever, good-tempered, and one of the pleasantest fellows that ever lived. The women all like him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So the Duchess tells me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But he is not what I call loyal. He cannot keep himself from running after strange gods. What need had he to take up the Church question at Tankerville? The truth is, Duke, the thing is going to pieces. We get men into the House now who are clever, and all that sort of thing, and who force their way up, but who can&#39;t be made to understand that everybody should not want to be Prime Minister.&quot; The Duke, who was now a Nestor among politicians, though very green in his age, smiled as he heard remarks which had been familiar to him for the last forty years. He, too, liked his party, and was fond of loyal men; but he had learned at last that all loyalty must be built on a basis of self-advantage. Patriotism may exist without it, but that which Erle called loyalty in politics was simply devotion to the side which a man conceives to be his side, and which he cannot leave without danger to himself.</p><p>But if discontent was felt at the eagerness with which this subject was taken up at certain boroughs, and was adopted by men whose votes and general support would be essentially necessary to the would-be coming Liberal Government, absolute dismay was occasioned by a speech that was made at a certain county election. Mr. Daubeny had for many years been member for East Barsetshire, and was as sure of his seat as the Queen of her throne. No one would think of contesting Mr. Daubeny&#39;s right to sit for East Barsetshire, and no doubt he might have been returned without showing himself to the electors. But he did show himself to the electors; and, as a matter of course, made a speech on the occasion. It so happened that the day fixed for the election in this division of the county was quite at the close of this period of political excitement. When Mr. Daubeny addressed his friends in East Barsetshire the returns throughout the kingdom were nearly complete. No attention had been paid to this fact during the elections, but it was afterwards asserted that the arrangement had been made with a political purpose, and with a purpose which was politically dishonest. Mr. Daubeny, so said the angry Liberals, had not chosen to address his constituents till his speech at the hustings could have no effect on other counties. Otherwise,--so said the Liberals,--the whole Conservative party would have been called upon to disavow at the hustings the conclusion to which Mr. Daubeny hinted in East Barsetshire that he had arrived. The East Barsetshire men themselves,--so said the Liberals,--had been too crass to catch the meaning hidden under his ambiguous words; but those words, when read by the light of astute criticism, were found to contain an opinion that Church and State should be dissevered. &quot;By G----! he&#39;s going to take the bread out of our mouths again,&quot; said Mr. Ratler.</p><p>The speech was certainly very ambiguous, and I am not sure that the East Barsetshire folk were so crass as they were accused of being, in not understanding it at once. The dreadful hint was wrapped up in many words, and formed but a small part of a very long oration. The bucolic mind of East Barsetshire took warm delight in the eloquence of the eminent personage who represented them, but was wont to extract more actual enjoyment from the music of his periods than from the strength of his arguments. When he would explain to them that he had discovered a new, or rather hitherto unknown, Conservative element in the character of his countrymen, which he could best utilise by changing everything in the Constitution, he manipulated his words with such grace, was so profound, so broad, and so exalted, was so brilliant in mingling a deep philosophy with the ordinary politics of the day, that the bucolic mind could only admire. It was a great honour to the electors of that agricultural county that they should be made the first recipients of these pearls, which were not wasted by being thrown before them. They were picked up by the gentlemen of the Press, and became the pearls, not of East Barsetshire, but of all England. On this occasion it was found that one pearl was very big, very rare, and worthy of great attention; but it was a black pearl, and was regarded by many as an abominable prodigy. &quot;The period of our history is one in which it becomes essential for us to renew those inquiries which have prevailed since man first woke to his destiny, as to the amount of connection which exists and which must exist between spiritual and simply human forms of government,--between our daily religion and our daily politics, between the Crown and the Mitre.&quot; The East Barsetshire clergymen and the East Barsetshire farmers like to hear something of the mitre in political speeches at the hustings. The word sounds pleasantly in their ears, as appertaining to good old gracious times and good old gracious things. As honey falls fast from the mouth of the practised speaker, the less practised hearer is apt to catch more of the words than of the sense. The speech of Mr. Daubeny was taken all in good part by his assembled friends. But when it was read by the quidnuncs on the following day it was found to contain so deep a meaning that it produced from Mr. Ratler&#39;s mouth those words of fear which have been already quoted.</p><p>Could it really be the case that the man intended to perform so audacious a trick of legerdemain as this for the preservation of his power, and that if he intended it he should have the power to carry it through? The renewal of inquiry as to the connection which exists between the Crown and the Mitre, when the bran was bolted, could only mean the disestablishment of the Church. Mr. Ratler and his friends were not long in bolting the bran. Regarding the matter simply in its own light, without bringing to bear upon it the experience of the last half-century, Mr. Ratler would have thought his party strong enough to defy Mr. Daubeny utterly in such an attempt. The ordinary politician, looking at Mr. Daubeny&#39;s position as leader of the Conservative party, as a statesman depending on the support of the Church, as a Minister appointed to his present place for the express object of defending all that was left of old, and dear, and venerable in the Constitution, would have declared that Mr. Daubeny was committing political suicide, as to which future history would record a verdict of probably not temporary insanity. And when the speech was a week old this was said in many a respectable household through the country. Many a squire, many a parson, many a farmer was grieved for Mr. Daubeny when the words had been explained to him, who did not for a moment think that the words could be portentous as to the great Conservative party. But Mr. Ratler remembered Catholic emancipation, had himself been in the House when the Corn Laws were repealed, and had been nearly broken-hearted when household suffrage had become the law of the land while a Conservative Cabinet and a Conservative Government were in possession of dominion in Israel.</p><p>Mr. Bonteen was disposed to think that the trick was beyond the conjuring power even of Mr. Daubeny. &quot;After all, you know, there is the party,&quot; he said to Mr. Ratler. Mr. Ratler&#39;s face was as good as a play, and if seen by that party would have struck that party with dismay and shame. The meaning of Mr. Ratler&#39;s face was plain enough. He thought so little of that party, on the score either of intelligence, honesty, or fidelity, as to imagine that it would consent to be led whithersoever Mr. Daubeny might choose to lead it. &quot;If they care about anything, it&#39;s about the Church,&quot; said Mr. Bonteen.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s something they like a great deal better than the Church,&quot; said Mr. Ratler. &quot;Indeed, there&#39;s only one thing they care about at all now. They&#39;ve given up all the old things. It&#39;s very likely that if Daubeny were to ask them to vote for pulling down the Throne and establishing a Republic they&#39;d all follow him into the lobby like sheep. They&#39;ve been so knocked about by one treachery after another that they don&#39;t care now for anything beyond their places.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s only a few of them get anything, after all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, they do. It isn&#39;t just so much a year they want, though those who have that won&#39;t like to part with it. But they like getting the counties, and the Garters, and the promotion in the army. They like their brothers to be made bishops, and their sisters like the Wardrobe and the Bedchamber. There isn&#39;t one of them that doesn&#39;t hang on somewhere,--or at least not many. Do you remember Peel&#39;s bill for the Corn Laws?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There were fifty went against him then,&quot; said Bonteen.</p><p>&quot;And what are fifty? A man doesn&#39;t like to be one of fifty. It&#39;s too many for glory, and not enough for strength. There has come up among them a general feeling that it&#39;s just as well to let things slide,--as the Yankees say. They&#39;re down-hearted about it enough within their own houses, no doubt. But what can they do, if they hold back? Some stout old cavalier here and there may shut himself up in his own castle, and tell himself that the world around him may go to wrack and ruin, but that he will not help the evil work. Some are shutting themselves up. Look at old Quin, when they carried their Reform Bill. But men, as a rule, don&#39;t like to be shut up. How they reconcile it to their conscience,--that&#39;s what I can&#39;t understand.&quot; Such was the wisdom, and such were the fears of Mr. Ratler. Mr. Bonteen, however, could not bring himself to believe that the Arch-enemy would on this occasion be successful. &quot;It mayn&#39;t be too hot for him,&quot; said Mr. Bonteen, when he reviewed the whole matter, &quot;but I think it&#39;ll be too heavy.&quot;</p><p>They who had mounted higher than Mr. Ratler and Mr. Bonteen on the political ladder, but who had mounted on the same side, were no less astonished than their inferiors; and, perhaps, were equally disgusted, though they did not allow themselves to express their disgust as plainly. Mr. Gresham was staying in the country with his friend, Lord Cantrip, when the tidings reached them of Mr. Daubeny&#39;s speech to the electors of East Barsetshire. Mr. Gresham and Lord Cantrip had long sat in the same Cabinet, and were fast friends, understanding each other&#39;s views, and thoroughly trusting each other&#39;s loyalty. &quot;He means it,&quot; said Lord Cantrip.</p><p>&quot;He means to see if it be possible,&quot; said the other. &quot;It is thrown out as a feeler to his own party.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll do him the justice of saying that he&#39;s not afraid of his party. If he means it, he means it altogether, and will not retract it, even though the party should refuse as a body to support him. I give him no other credit, but I give him that.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Gresham paused for a few moments before he answered. &quot;I do not know,&quot; said he, &quot;whether we are justified in thinking that one man will always be the same. Daubeny has once been very audacious, and he succeeded. But he had two things to help him,--a leader, who, though thoroughly trusted, was very idle, and an ill-defined question. When he had won his leader he had won his party. He has no such tower of strength now. And in the doing of this thing, if he means to do it, he must encounter the assured conviction of every man on his own side, both in the upper and lower House. When he told them that he would tap a Conservative element by reducing the suffrage they did not know whether to believe him or not. There might be something in it. It might be that they would thus resume a class of suffrage existing in former days, but which had fallen into abeyance, because not properly protected. They could teach themselves to believe that it might be so, and those among them who found it necessary to free their souls did so teach themselves. I don&#39;t see how they are to free their souls when they are invited to put down the State establishment of the Church.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#39;ll find a way for them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s possible. I&#39;m the last man in the world to contest the possibility, or even the expediency, of changes in political opinion. But I do not know whether it follows that because he was brave and successful once he must necessarily be brave and successful again. A man rides at some outrageous fence, and by the wonderful activity and obedient zeal of his horse is carried over it in safety. It does not follow that his horse will carry him over a house, or that he should be fool enough to ask the beast to do so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He intends to ride at the house,&quot; said Lord Cantrip; &quot;and he means it because others have talked of it. You saw the line which my rash young friend Finn took at Tankerville.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And all for nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am not so sure of that. They say he is like the rest. If Daubeny does carry the party with him, I suppose the days of the Church are numbered.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what if they be?&quot; Mr. Gresham almost sighed as he said this, although he intended to express a certain amount of satisfaction. &quot;What if they be? You know, and I know, that the thing has to be done. Whatever may be our own individual feelings, or even our present judgment on the subject,--as to which neither of us can perhaps say that his mind is not so made up that it may not soon be altered,--we know that the present union cannot remain. It is unfitted for that condition of humanity to which we are coming, and if so, the change must be for good. Why should not he do it as well as another? Or rather would not he do it better than another, if he can do it with less of animosity than we should rouse against us? If the blow would come softer from his hands than from ours, with less of a feeling of injury to those who dearly love the Church, should we not be glad that he should undertake the task?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then you will not oppose him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah;--there is much to be considered before we can say that. Though he may not be bound by his friends, we may be bound by ours. And then, though I can hint to you at a certain condition of mind, and can sympathise with you, feeling that such may become the condition of your mind, I cannot say that I should act upon it as an established conviction, or that I can expect that you will do so. If such be the political programme submitted to us when the House meets, then we must be prepared.&quot;</p><p>Lord Cantrip also paused a moment before he answered, but he had his answer ready. &quot;I can frankly say that I should follow your leading, but that I should give my voice for opposition.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your voice is always persuasive,&quot; said Mr. Gresham.</p><p>But the consternation felt among Mr. Daubeny&#39;s friends was infinitely greater than that which fell among his enemies, when those wonderful words were read, discussed, criticised, and explained. It seemed to every clergyman in England that nothing short of disestablishment could be intended by them. And this was the man to whom they had all looked for protection! This was the bulwark of the Church, to whom they had trusted! This was the hero who had been so sound and so firm respecting the Irish Establishment, when evil counsels had been allowed to prevail in regard to that ill-used but still sacred vineyard! All friends of the Church had then whispered among themselves fearfully, and had, with sad looks and grievous forebodings, acknowledged that the thin edge of the wedge had been driven into the very rock of the Establishment. The enemies of the Church were known to be powerful, numerous, and of course unscrupulous. But surely this Brutus would not raise a dagger against this Caesar! And yet, if not, what was the meaning of those words? And then men and women began to tell each other,--the men and women who are the very salt of the earth in this England of ours,--that their Brutus, in spite of his great qualities, had ever been mysterious, unintelligible, dangerous, and given to feats of conjuring. They had only been too submissive to their Brutus. Wonderful feats of conjuring they had endured, understanding nothing of the manner in which they were performed,--nothing of their probable results; but this feat of conjuring they would not endure. And so there were many meetings held about the country, though the time for combined action was very short.</p><p>Nothing more audacious than the speaking of those few words to the bucolic electors of East Barsetshire had ever been done in the political history of England. Cromwell was bold when he closed the Long Parliament. Shaftesbury was bold when he formed the plot for which Lord Russell and others suffered. Walpole was bold when, in his lust for power, he discarded one political friend after another. And Peel was bold when he resolved to repeal the Corn Laws. But in none of these instances was the audacity displayed more wonderful than when Mr. Daubeny took upon himself to make known throughout the country his intention of abolishing the Church of England. For to such a declaration did those few words amount. He was now the recognised parliamentary leader of that party to which the Church of England was essentially dear. He had achieved his place by skill, rather than principle,--by the conviction on men&#39;s minds that he was necessary rather than that he was fit. But still, there he was; and, though he had alarmed many,--had, probably, alarmed all those who followed him by his eccentric and dangerous mode of carrying on the battle; though no Conservative regarded him as safe; yet on this question of the Church it had been believed that he was sound. What might be the special ideas of his own mind regarding ecclesiastical policy in general, it had not been thought necessary to consider. His utterances had been confusing, mysterious, and perhaps purposely unintelligible; but that was matter of little moment so long as he was prepared to defend the establishment of the Church of England as an institution adapted for English purposes. On that point it was believed that he was sound. To that mast it was supposed he had nailed his own colours and those of his party. In defending that fortress it was thought that he would be ready to fall, should the defence of it require a fall. It was because he was so far safe that he was there. And yet he spoke these words without consulting a single friend, or suggesting the propriety of his new scheme to a single supporter. And he knew what he was doing. This was the way in which he had thought it best to make known to his own followers, not only that he was about to abandon the old Institution, but that they must do so too!</p><p>As regarded East Barsetshire itself, he was returned, and feted, and sent home with his ears stuffed with eulogy, before the bucolic mind had discovered his purpose. On so much he had probably calculated. But he had calculated also that after an interval of three or four days his secret would be known to all friends and enemies. On the day after his speech came the report of it in the newspapers; on the next day the leading articles, in which the world was told what it was that the Prime Minister had really said. Then, on the following day, the startled parsons, and the startled squires and farmers, and, above all, the startled peers and members of the Lower House, whose duty it was to vote as he should lead them, were all agog. Could it be that the newspapers were right in this meaning which they had attached to these words? On the day week after the election in East Barsetshire, a Cabinet Council was called in London, at which it would, of course, be Mr. Daubeny&#39;s duty to explain to his colleagues what it was that he did purpose to do.</p><p>In the meantime he saw a colleague or two.</p><p>&quot;Let us look it straight in the face,&quot; he said to a noble colleague; &quot;we must look it in the face before long.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But we need not hurry it forward.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is a storm coming. We knew that before, and we heard the sound of it from every husting in the country. How shall we rule the storm so that it may pass over the land without devastating it? If we bring in a bill--&quot;</p><p>&quot;A bill for disestablishing the Church!&quot; said the horror-stricken lord.</p><p>&quot;If we bring in a bill, the purport of which shall be to moderate the ascendancy of the Church in accordance with the existing religious feelings of the population, we shall save much that otherwise must fall. If there must be a bill, would you rather that it should be modelled by us who love the Church, or by those who hate it?&quot;</p><p>That lord was very wrath, and told the right honourable gentleman to his face that his duty to his party should have constrained him to silence on that subject till he had consulted his colleagues. In answer to this Mr. Daubeny said with much dignity that, should such be the opinion of his colleagues in general, he would at once abandon the high place which he held in their councils. But he trusted that it might be otherwise. He had felt himself bound to communicate his ideas to his constituents, and had known that in doing so some minds must be shocked. He trusted that he might be able to allay this feeling of dismay. As regarded this noble lord, he did succeed in lessening the dismay before the meeting was over, though he did not altogether allay it.</p><p>Another gentleman who was in the habit of sitting at Mr. Daubeny&#39;s elbow daily in the House of Commons was much gentler with him, both as to words and manner. &quot;It&#39;s a bold throw, but I&#39;m afraid it won&#39;t come up sixes,&quot; said the right honourable gentleman.</p><p>&quot;Let it come up fives, then. It&#39;s the only chance we have; and if you think, as I do, that it is essentially necessary for the welfare of the country that we should remain where we are, we must run the risk.&quot;</p><p>With another colleague, whose mind was really set on that which the Church is presumed to represent, he used another argument. &quot;I am convinced at any rate of this,&quot; said Mr. Daubeny; &quot;that by sacrificing something of that ascendancy which the Establishment is supposed to give us, we can bring the Church, which we love, nearer to the wants of the people.&quot; And so it came about that before the Cabinet met, every member of it knew what it was that was expected of him.</p><p>CHAPTER VI.</p><p>PHINEAS AND HIS OLD FRIENDS.</p><p>Phineas Finn returned from Tankerville to London in much better spirits than those which had accompanied him on his journey thither. He was not elected; but then, before the election, he had come to believe that it was quite out of the question that he should be elected. And now he did think it probable that he should get the seat on a petition. A scrutiny used to be a very expensive business, but under the existing law, made as the scrutiny would be in the borough itself, it would cost but little; and that little, should he be successful, would fall on the shoulders of Mr. Browborough. Should he knock off eight votes and lose none himself, he would be member for Tankerville. He knew that many votes had been given for Browborough which, if the truth were known of them, would be knocked off; and he did not know that the same could be said of any one of those by which he had been supported. But, unfortunately, the judge by whom all this would be decided might not reach Tankerville in his travels till after Christmas, perhaps not till after Easter; and in the meantime, what should he do with himself?</p><p>As for going back to Dublin, that was now out of the question. He had entered upon a feverish state of existence in which it was impossible that he should live in Ireland. Should he ultimately fail in regard to his seat he must--vanish out of the world. While he remained in his present condition he would not even endeavour to think how he might in such case best bestow himself. For the present he would remain within the region of politics, and live as near as he could to the whirl of the wheel of which the sound was so dear to him. Of one club he had always remained a member, and he had already been re-elected a member of the Reform. So he took up his residence once more at the house of a certain Mr. and Mrs. Bunce, in Great Marlborough Street, with whom he had lodged when he first became a member of Parliament.</p><p>&quot;So you&#39;re at the old game, Mr. Finn?&quot; said his landlord.</p><p>&quot;Yes; at the old game. I suppose it&#39;s the same with you?&quot; Now Mr. Bunce had been a very violent politician, and used to rejoice in calling himself a Democrat.</p><p>&quot;Pretty much the same, Mr. Finn. I don&#39;t see that things are much better than they used to be. They tell me at the People&#39;s Banner office that the lords have had as much to do with this election as with any that ever went before it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps they don&#39;t know much about it at the People&#39;s Banner office. I thought Mr. Slide and the People&#39;s Banner had gone over to the other side, Bunce?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mr. Slide is pretty wide-awake whatever side he&#39;s on. Not but what he&#39;s disgraced himself by what he&#39;s been and done now.&quot; Mr. Slide in former days had been the editor of the People&#39;s Banner, and circumstances had arisen in consequence of which there had been some acquaintance between him and our hero. &quot;I see you was hammering away at the Church down at Tankerville.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I just said a word or two.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You was all right, there, Mr. Finn. I can&#39;t say as I ever saw very much in your religion; but what a man keeps in the way of religion for his own use is never nothing to me;--as what I keeps is nothing to him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m afraid you don&#39;t keep much, Mr. Bunce.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And that&#39;s nothing to you, neither, is it, sir?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, indeed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But when we read of Churches as is called State Churches,--Churches as have bishops you and I have to pay for, as never goes into them--&quot;</p><p>&quot;But we don&#39;t pay the bishops, Mr. Bunce.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh yes, we do; because, if they wasn&#39;t paid, the money would come to us to do as we pleased with it. We proved all that when we pared them down a bit. What&#39;s an Ecclesiastical Commission? Only another name for a box to put the money into till you want to take it out again. When we hear of Churches such as these, as is not kept up by the people who uses them,--just as the theatres are, Mr. Finn, or the gin shops,--then I know there&#39;s a deal more to be done before honest men can come by their own. You&#39;re right enough, Mr. Finn, you are, as far as churches go, and you was right, too, when you cut and run off the Treasury Bench. I hope you ain&#39;t going to sit on that stool again.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Bunce was a privileged person, and Mrs. Bunce made up for his apparent rudeness by her own affectionate cordiality. &quot;Deary me, and isn&#39;t it a thing for sore eyes to have you back again! I never expected this. But I&#39;ll do for you, Mr. Finn, just as I ever did in the old days; and it was I that was sorry when I heard of the poor young lady&#39;s death; so I was, Mr. Finn; well, then, I won&#39;t mention her name never again. But after all there&#39;s been betwixt you and us it wouldn&#39;t be natural to pass it by without one word; would it, Mr. Finn? Well, yes; he&#39;s just the same man as ever, without a ha&#39;porth of difference. He&#39;s gone on paying that shilling to the Union every week of his life, just as he used to do; and never got so much out of it, not as a junketing into the country. That he didn&#39;t. It makes me that sick sometimes when I think of where it&#39;s gone to, that I don&#39;t know how to bear it. Well, yes; that is true, Mr. Finn. There never was a man better at bringing home his money to his wife than Bunce, barring that shilling. If he&#39;d drink it, which he never does, I think I&#39;d bear it better than give it to that nasty Union. And young Jack writes as well as his father, pretty nigh, Mr. Finn, which is a comfort,&quot;--Mr. Bunce was a journeyman scrivener at a law stationer&#39;s,--&quot;and keeps his self; but he don&#39;t bring home his money, nor yet it can&#39;t be expected, Mr. Finn. I know what the young &#39;uns will do, and what they won&#39;t. And Mary Jane is quite handy about the house now,--only she do break things, which is an aggravation; and the hot water shall be always up at eight o&#39;clock to a minute, if I bring it with my own hand, Mr. Finn.&quot;</p><p>[Illustration: &quot;Well, then, I won&#39;t mention her name again.&quot;]</p><p>And so he was established once more in his old rooms in Great Marlborough Street; and as he sat back in the arm-chair, which he used to know so well, a hundred memories of former days crowded back upon him. Lord Chiltern for a few months had lived with him; and then there had arisen a quarrel, which he had for a time thought would dissolve his old life into ruin. Now Lord Chiltern was again his very intimate friend. And there had used to sit a needy money-lender whom he had been unable to banish. Alas! alas! how soon might he now require that money-lender&#39;s services! And then he recollected how he had left these rooms to go into others, grander and more appropriate to his life when he had filled high office under the State. Would there ever again come to him such cause for migration? And would he again be able to load the frame of the looking-glass over the fire with countless cards from Countesses and Ministers&#39; wives? He had opened the oyster for himself once, though it had closed again with so sharp a snap when the point of his knife had been withdrawn. Would he be able to insert the point again between those two difficult shells? Would the Countesses once more be kind to him? Would drawing-rooms be opened to him, and sometimes opened to him and to no other? Then he thought of certain special drawing-rooms in which wonderful things had been said to him. Since that he had been a married man, and those special drawing-rooms and those wonderful words had in no degree actuated him in his choice of a wife. He had left all those things of his own free will, as though telling himself that there was a better life than they offered to him. But was he sure that he had found it to be better? He had certainly sighed for the gauds which he had left. While his young wife was living he had kept his sighs down, so that she should not hear them; but he had been forced to acknowledge that his new life had been vapid and flavourless. Now he had been tempted back again to the old haunts. Would the Countesses&#39; cards be showered upon him again?</p><p>One card, or rather note, had reached him while he was yet at Tankerville, reminding him of old days. It was from Mrs. Low, the wife of the barrister with whom he had worked when he had been a law student in London. She had asked him to come and dine with them after the old fashion in Baker Street, naming a day as to which she presumed that he would by that time have finished his affairs at Tankerville, intimating also that Mr. Low would then have finished his at North Broughton. Now Mr. Low had sat for North Broughton before Phineas left London, and his wife spoke of the seat as a certainty. Phineas could not keep himself from feeling that Mrs. Low intended to triumph over him; but, nevertheless, he accepted the invitation. They were very glad to see him, explaining that, as nobody was supposed to be in town, nobody had been asked to meet him. In former days he had been very intimate in that house, having received from both of them much kindness, mingled, perhaps, with some touch of severity on the part of the lady. But the ground for that was gone, and Mrs. Low was no longer painfully severe. A few words were said as to his great loss. Mrs. Low once raised her eyebrows in pretended surprise when Phineas explained that he had thrown up his place, and then they settled down on the question of the day. &quot;And so,&quot; said Mrs. Low, &quot;you&#39;ve begun to attack the Church?&quot; It must be remembered that at this moment Mr. Daubeny had not as yet electrified the minds of East Barsetshire, and that, therefore, Mrs. Low was not disturbed. To Mrs. Low, Church and State was the very breath of her nostrils; and if her husband could not be said to live by means of the same atmosphere it was because the breath of his nostrils had been drawn chiefly in the Vice-Chancellor&#39;s Court in Lincoln&#39;s Inn. But he, no doubt, would be very much disturbed indeed should he ever be told that he was required, as an expectant member of Mr. Daubeny&#39;s party, to vote for the Disestablishment of the Church of England.</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t mean that I am guilty of throwing the first stone?&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;They have been throwing stones at the Temple since first it was built,&quot; said Mrs. Low, with energy; &quot;but they have fallen off its polished shafts in dust and fragments.&quot; I am afraid that Mrs. Low, when she allowed herself to speak thus energetically, entertained some confused idea that the Church of England and the Christian religion were one and the same thing, or, at least, that they had been brought into the world together.</p><p>&quot;You haven&#39;t thrown the first stone,&quot; said Mr. Low; &quot;but you have taken up the throwing at the first moment in which stones may be dangerous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No stones can be dangerous,&quot; said Mrs. Low.</p><p>&quot;The idea of a State Church,&quot; said Phineas, &quot;is opposed to my theory of political progress. What I hope is that my friends will not suppose that I attack the Protestant Church because I am a Roman Catholic. If I were a priest it would be my business to do so; but I am not a priest.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Low gave his old friend a bottle of his best wine, and in all friendly observances treated him with due affection. But neither did he nor did his wife for a moment abstain from attacking their guest in respect to his speeches at Tankerville. It seemed, indeed, to Phineas that as Mrs. Low was buckled up in such triple armour that she feared nothing, she might have been less loud in expressing her abhorrence of the enemies of the Church. If she feared nothing, why should she scream so loudly? Between the two he was a good deal crushed and confounded, and Mrs. Low was very triumphant when she allowed him to escape from her hands at ten o&#39;clock. But, at that moment, nothing had as yet been heard in Baker Street of Mr. Daubeny&#39;s proposition to the electors of East Barsetshire! Poor Mrs. Low! We can foresee that there is much grief in store for her, and some rocks ahead, too, in the political career of her husband.</p><p>Phineas was still in London, hanging about the clubs, doing nothing, discussing Mr. Daubeny&#39;s wonderful treachery with such men as came up to town, and waiting for the meeting of Parliament, when he received the following letter from Lady Laura Kennedy:--</p><p>Dresden, November 18, ----.</p><p>MY DEAR MR. FINN,</p><p>I have heard with great pleasure from my sister-in-law that you have been staying with them at Harrington Hall. It seems so like old days that you and Oswald and Violet should be together,--so much more natural than that you should be living in Dublin. I cannot conceive of you as living any other life than that of the House of Commons, Downing Street, and the clubs. Nor do I wish to do so. And when I hear of you at Harrington Hall I know that you are on your way to the other things.</p><p>Do tell me what life is like with Oswald and Violet. Of course he never writes. He is one of those men who, on marrying, assume that they have at last got a person to do a duty which has always hitherto been neglected. Violet does write, but tells me little or nothing of themselves. Her letters are very nice, full of anecdote, well written,--letters that are fit to be kept and printed; but they are never family letters. She is inimitable in discussing the miseries of her own position as the wife of a Master of Hounds; but the miseries are as evidently fictitious as the art is real. She told me how poor dear Lady Baldock communicated to you her unhappiness about her daughter in a manner that made even me laugh; and would make thousands laugh in days to come were it ever to be published. But of her inside life, of her baby, or of her husband as a husband, she never says a word. You will have seen it all, and have enough of the feminine side of a man&#39;s character to be able to tell me how they are living. I am sure they are happy together, because Violet has more common sense than any woman I ever knew.</p><p>And pray tell me about the affair at Tankerville. My cousin Barrington writes me word that you will certainly get the seat. He declares that Mr. Browborough is almost disposed not to fight the battle, though a man more disposed to fight never bribed an elector. But Barrington seems to think that you managed as well as you did by getting outside the traces, as he calls it. We certainly did not think that you would come out strong against the Church. Don&#39;t suppose that I complain. For myself I hate to think of the coming severance; but if it must come, why not by your hands as well as by any other? It is hardly possible that you in your heart should love a Protestant ascendant Church. But, as Barrington says, a horse won&#39;t get oats unless he works steady between the traces.</p><p>As to myself, what am I to say to you? I and my father live here a sad, sombre, solitary life, together. We have a large furnished house outside the town, with a pleasant view and a pretty garden. He does--nothing. He reads the English papers, and talks of English parties, is driven out, and eats his dinner, and sleeps. At home, as you know, not only did he take an active part in politics, but he was active also in the management of his own property. Now it seems to him to be almost too great a trouble to write a letter to his steward; and all this has come upon him because of me. He is here because he cannot bear that I should live alone. I have offered to return with him to Saulsby, thinking that Mr. Kennedy would trouble me no further,--or to remain here by myself; but he will consent to neither. In truth the burden of idleness has now fallen upon him so heavily that he cannot shake it off. He dreads that he may be called upon to do anything.</p><p>To me it is all one tragedy. I cannot but think of things as they were two or three years since. My father and my husband were both in the Cabinet, and you, young as you were, stood but one step below it. Oswald was out in the cold. He was very poor. Papa thought all evil of him. Violet had refused him over and over again. He quarrelled with you, and all the world seemed against him. Then of a sudden you vanished, and we vanished. An ineffable misery fell upon me and upon my wretched husband. All our good things went from us at a blow. I and my poor father became as it were outcasts. But Oswald suddenly retricked his beams, and is flaming in the forehead of the morning sky. He, I believe, has no more than he has deserved. He won his wife honestly;--did he not? And he has ever been honest. It is my pride to think I never gave him up. But the bitter part of my cup consists in this,--that as he has won what he has deserved, so have we. I complain of no injustice. Our castle was built upon the sand. Why should Mr. Kennedy have been a Cabinet Minister;--and why should I have been his wife? There is no one else of whom I can ask that question as I can of you, and no one else who can answer it as you can do.</p><p>Of Mr. Kennedy it is singular how little I know, and how little I ever hear. There is no one whom I can ask to tell me of him. That he did not attend during the last Session I do know, and we presume that he has now abandoned his seat. I fear that his health is bad,--or perhaps, worse still, that his mind is affected by the gloom of his life. I suppose that he lives exclusively at Loughlinter. From time to time I am implored by him to return to my duty beneath his roof. He grounds his demand on no affection of his own, on no presumption that any affection can remain with me. He says no word of happiness. He offers no comfort. He does not attempt to persuade with promises of future care. He makes his claim simply on Holy Writ, and on the feeling of duty which thence ought to weigh upon me. He has never even told me that he loves me; but he is persistent in declaring that those whom God has joined together nothing human should separate. Since I have been here I have written to him once,--one sad, long, weary letter. Since that I am constrained to leave his letters unanswered.</p><p>And now, my friend, could you not do for me a great kindness? For a while, till the inquiry be made at Tankerville, your time must be vacant. Cannot you come and see us? I have told Papa that I should ask you, and he would be delighted. I cannot explain to you what it would be to me to be able to talk again to one who knows all the errors and all the efforts of my past life as you do. Dresden is very cold in the winter. I do not know whether you would mind that. We are very particular about the rooms, but my father bears the temperature wonderfully well, though he complains. In March we move down south for a couple of months. Do come if you can.</p><p>Most sincerely yours,</p><p>LAURA KENNEDY.</p><p>If you come, of course you will have yourself brought direct to us. If you can learn anything of Mr. Kennedy&#39;s life, and of his real condition, pray do. The faint rumours which reach me are painfully distressing.</p><p>CHAPTER VII.</p><p>COMING HOME FROM HUNTING.</p><p>Lady Chiltern was probably right when she declared that her husband must have been made to be a Master of Hounds,--presuming it to be granted that somebody must be Master of Hounds. Such necessity certainly does exist in this, the present condition of England. Hunting prevails; hunting men increase in numbers; foxes are preserved; farmers do not rebel; owners of coverts, even when they are not hunting men themselves, acknowledge the fact, and do not dare to maintain their pheasants at the expense of the much better-loved four-footed animal. Hounds are bred, and horses are trained specially to the work. A master of fox hounds is a necessity of the period. Allowing so much, we cannot but allow also that Lord Chiltern must have been made to fill the situation. He understood hunting, and, perhaps, there was nothing else requiring acute intelligence that he did understand. And he understood hunting, not only as a huntsman understands it,--in that branch of the science which refers simply to the judicious pursuit of the fox, being probably inferior to his own huntsman in that respect,--but he knew exactly what men should do, and what they should not. In regard to all those various interests with which he was brought in contact, he knew when to hold fast to his own claims, and when to make no claims at all. He was afraid of no one, but he was possessed of a sense of justice which induced him to acknowledge the rights of those around him. When he found that the earths were not stopped in Trumpeton Wood,--from which he judged that the keeper would complain that the hounds would not or could not kill any of the cubs found there,--he wrote in very round terms to the Duke who owned it. If His Grace did not want to have the wood drawn, let him say so. If he did, let him have the earths stopped. But when that great question came up as to the Gartlow coverts--when that uncommonly disagreeable gentleman, Mr. Smith, of Gartlow, gave notice that the hounds should not be admitted into his place at all,--Lord Chiltern soon put the whole matter straight by taking part with the disagreeable gentleman. The disagreeable gentleman had been ill used. Men had ridden among his young laurels. If gentlemen who did hunt,--so said Lord Chiltern to his own supporters,--did not know how to conduct themselves in a matter of hunting, how was it to be expected that a gentleman who did not hunt should do so? On this occasion Lord Chiltern rated his own hunt so roundly that Mr. Smith and he were quite in a bond together, and the Gartlow coverts were re-opened. Now all the world knows that the Gartlow coverts, though small, are material as being in the very centre of the Brake country.</p><p>It is essential that a Master of Hounds should be somewhat feared by the men who ride with him. There should be much awe mixed with the love felt for him. He should be a man with whom other men will not care to argue; an irrational, cut and thrust, unscrupulous, but yet distinctly honest man; one who can be tyrannical, but will tyrannise only over the evil spirits; a man capable of intense cruelty to those alongside of him, but who will know whether his victim does in truth deserve scalping before he draws his knife. He should be savage and yet good-humoured; severe and yet forbearing; truculent and pleasant in the same moment. He should exercise unflinching authority, but should do so with the consciousness that he can support it only by his own popularity. His speech should be short, incisive, always to the point, but never founded on argument. His rules are based on no reason, and will never bear discussion. He must be the most candid of men, also the most close;--and yet never a hypocrite. He must condescend to no explanation, and yet must impress men with an assurance that his decisions will certainly be right. He must rule all as though no man&#39;s special welfare were of any account, and yet must administer all so as to offend none. Friends he must have, but not favourites. He must be self-sacrificing, diligent, eager, and watchful. He must be strong in health, strong in heart, strong in purpose, and strong in purse. He must be economical and yet lavish; generous as the wind and yet obdurate as the frost. He should be assured that of all human pursuits hunting is the best, and that of all living things a fox is the most valuable. He must so train his heart as to feel for the fox a mingled tenderness and cruelty which is inexplicable to ordinary men and women. His desire to preserve the brute and then to kill him should be equally intense and passionate. And he should do it all in accordance with a code of unwritten laws, which cannot be learnt without profound study. It may not perhaps be truly asserted that Lord Chiltern answered this description in every detail; but he combined so many of the qualities required that his wife showed her discernment when she declared that he seemed to have been made to be a Master of Hounds.</p><p>Early in that November he was riding home with Miss Palliser by his side, while the huntsmen and whips were trotting on with the hounds before him. &quot;You call that a good run, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p><p>[Illustration: Adelaide Palliser.]</p><p>&quot;No; I don&#39;t.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What was the matter with it? I declare it seems to me that something is always wrong. Men like hunting better than anything else, and yet I never find any man contented.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In the first place we didn&#39;t kill.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know you&#39;re short of foxes at Gartlow,&quot; said Miss Palliser, who, as is the manner with all hunting ladies, liked to show that she understood the affairs of the hunt.</p><p>&quot;If I knew there were but one fox in a county, and I got upon that one fox, I would like to kill that one fox,--barring a vixen in March.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought it very nice. It was fast enough for anybody.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You might go as fast with a drag, if that&#39;s all. I&#39;ll tell you something else. We should have killed him if Maule hadn&#39;t once ridden over the hounds when we came out of the little wood. I spoke very sharply to him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I heard you, Lord Chiltern.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I suppose you thought I was a brute.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who? I? No, I didn&#39;t;--not particularly, you know. Men do say such things to each other!&quot;</p><p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t mind it, I fancy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suppose a man does not like to be told that directly he shows himself in a run the sport is all over and the hounds ought to be taken home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did I say that? I don&#39;t remember now what I said, but I know he made me angry. Come, let us trot on. They can take the hounds home without us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good night, Cox,&quot; said Miss Palliser, as they passed by the pack. &quot;Poor Mr. Maule! I did pity him, and I do think he does care for it, though he is so impassive. He would be with us now, only he is chewing the cud of his unhappiness in solitude half a mile behind us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is hard upon you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hard upon me, Lord Chiltern! It is hard upon him, and, perhaps, upon you. Why should it be hard upon me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hard upon him, I should have said. Though why it shouldn&#39;t be the other way I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s a friend of yours.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And an especial friend, I suppose. As a matter of course Violet talks to me about you both.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No doubt she does. When once a woman is married she should be regarded as having thrown off her allegiance to her own sex. She is sure to be treacherous at any rate in one direction. Not that Lady Chiltern can tell anything of me that might not be told to all the world as far as I am concerned.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is nothing in it, then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Honour bright?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,--honour as bright as it ever is in such matters as these.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am sorry for that,--very sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why so, Lord Chiltern?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because if you were engaged to him I thought that perhaps you might have induced him to ride a little less forward.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lord Chiltern,&quot; said Miss Palliser, seriously; &quot;I will never again speak to you a word on any subject except hunting.&quot;</p><p>At this moment Gerard Maule came up behind them, with a cigar in his mouth, apparently quite unconscious of any of that displeasure as to which Miss Palliser had supposed that he was chewing the cud in solitude. &quot;That was a goodish thing, Chiltern,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Very good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the hounds hunted him well to the end.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s odd how the scent will die away at a moment. You see they couldn&#39;t carry on a field after we got out of the copse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not a field.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Considering all things I am glad we didn&#39;t kill him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uncommon glad,&quot; said Lord Chiltern. Then they trotted on in silence a little way, and Maule again dropped behind. &quot;I&#39;m blessed if he knows that I spoke to him, roughly,&quot; said Chiltern. &quot;He&#39;s deaf, I think, when he chooses to be.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re not sorry, Lord Chiltern.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not in the least. Nothing will ever do any good. As for offending him, you might as well swear at a tree, and think to offend it. There&#39;s comfort in that, anyway. I wonder whether he&#39;d talk to you if I went away?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I hope that you won&#39;t try the experiment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t believe he would, or I&#39;d go at once. I wonder whether you really do care for him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not in the least.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or he for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Quite indifferent, I should say; but I can&#39;t answer for him, Lord Chiltern, quite as positively as I can for myself. You know, as things go, people have to play at caring for each other.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s what we call flirting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just the reverse. Flirting I take to be the excitement of love, without its reality, and without its ordinary result in marriage. This playing at caring has none of the excitement, but it often leads to the result, and sometimes ends in downright affection.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If Maule perseveres then you&#39;ll take him, and by-and-bye you&#39;ll come to like him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In twenty years it might come to that, if we were always to live in the same house; but as he leaves Harrington to-morrow, and we may probably not meet each other for the next four years, I think the chance is small.&quot;</p><p>Then Maule trotted up again, and after riding in silence with the other two for half an hour, he pulled out his case and lit a fresh cigar from the end of the old one, which he threw away. &quot;Have a baccy, Chiltern?&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;No, thank you, I never smoke going home; my mind is too full. I&#39;ve all that family behind to think of, and I&#39;m generally out of sorts with the miseries of the day. I must say another word to Cox, or I should have to go to the kennels on my way home.&quot; And so he dropped behind.</p><p>Gerard Maule smoked half his cigar before he spoke a word, and Miss Palliser was quite resolved that she would not open her mouth till he had spoken. &quot;I suppose he likes it?&quot; he said at last.</p><p>&quot;Who likes what, Mr. Maule?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Chiltern likes blowing fellows up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a part of his business.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s the way I look at it. But I should think it must be disagreeable. He takes such a deal of trouble about it. I heard him going on to-day to some one as though his whole soul depended on it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is very energetic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just so. I&#39;m quite sure it&#39;s a mistake. What does a man ever get by it? Folks around you soon discount it till it goes for nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think energy goes for nothing, Mr. Maule.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A bull in a china shop is not a useful animal, nor is he ornamental, but there can be no doubt of his energy. The hare was full of energy, but he didn&#39;t win the race. The man who stands still is the man who keeps his ground.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t stand still when you&#39;re out hunting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No;--I ride about, and Chiltern swears at me. Every man is a fool sometimes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And your wisdom, perfect at all other times, breaks down in the hunting-field?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t in the least mind your chaffing. I know what you think of me just as well as though you told me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do I think of you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That I&#39;m a poor creature, generally half asleep, shallow-pated, slow-blooded, ignorant, useless, and unambitious.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly unambitious, Mr. Maule.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And that word carries all the others. What&#39;s the good of ambition? There&#39;s the man they were talking about last night,--that Irishman.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mr. Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes; Phineas Finn. He is an ambitious fellow. He&#39;ll have to starve, according to what Chiltern was saying. I&#39;ve sense enough to know I can&#39;t do any good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are sensible, I admit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very well, Miss Palliser. You can say just what you like, of course. You have that privilege.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did not mean to say anything severe. I do admit that you are master of a certain philosophy, for which much may be said. But you are not to expect that I shall express an approval which I do not feel.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I want you to approve it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah!--there, I fear, I cannot oblige you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I want you to approve it, though no one else may.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Though all else should do so, I cannot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then take the task of curing the sick one, and of strengthening the weak one, into your own hands. If you will teach, perhaps I may learn.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have no mission for teaching, Mr. Maule.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You once said that,--that--&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do not be so ungenerous as to throw in my teeth what I once said,--if I ever said a word that I would not now repeat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not think that I am ungenerous, Miss Palliser.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am sure you are not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nor am I self-confident. I am obliged to seek comfort from such scraps of encouragement as may have fallen in my way here and there. I once did think that you intended to love me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Does love go by intentions?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think so,--frequently with men, and much more so with girls.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It will never go so with me. I shall never intend to love any one. If I ever love any man it will be because I am made to do so, despite my intentions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As a fortress is taken?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well,--if you like to put it so. Only I claim this advantage,--that I can always get rid of my enemy when he bores me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Am I boring you now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t say so. Here is Lord Chiltern again, and I know by the rattle of his horse&#39;s feet that something is the matter.&quot;</p><p>Lord Chiltern came up full of wrath. One of the men&#39;s horses was thoroughly broken down, and, as the Master said, wasn&#39;t worth the saddle he carried. He didn&#39;t care a ---- for the horse, but the man hadn&#39;t told him. &quot;At this rate there won&#39;t be anything to carry anybody by Christmas.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;ll have to buy some more,&quot; said Gerard Maule.</p><p>&quot;Buy some more!&quot; said Lord Chiltern, turning round, and looking at the man. &quot;He talks of buying horses as he would sugar plums!&quot; Then they trotted in at the gate, and in two minutes were at the hall door.</p><p>CHAPTER VIII.</p><p>THE ADDRESS.</p><p>Before the 11th of November, the day on which Parliament was to meet, the whole country was in a hubbub. Consternation and triumph were perhaps equally predominant, and equally strong. There were those who declared that now at length was Great Britain to be ruined in actual present truth; and those who asserted that, of a sudden, after a fashion so wholly unexpected as to be divine,--as great fires, great famines, and great wars are called divine,--a mighty hand had been stretched out to take away the remaining incubus of superstition, priestcraft, and bigotry under which England had hitherto been labouring. The proposed disestablishment of the State Church of England was, of course, the subject of this diversity of opinion.</p><p>And there was not only diversity, but with it great confusion. The political feelings of the country are, as a rule, so well marked that it is easy, as to almost every question, to separate the sheep from the goats. With but few exceptions one can tell where to look for the supporters and where for the opponents of one measure or of another. Meetings are called in this or in that public hall to assist or to combat the Minister of the day, and men know what they are about. But now it was not so. It was understood that Mr. Daubeny, the accredited leader of the Conservatives, was about to bring in the bill, but no one as yet knew who would support the bill. His own party, to a man,--without a single exception,--were certainly opposed to the measure in their minds. It must be so. It could not but be certain that they should hate it. Each individual sitting on the Conservative side in either House did most certainly within his own bosom cry Ichabod when the fatal news reached his ears. But such private opinions and inward wailings need not, and probably would not, guide the body. Ichabod had been cried before, though probably never with such intensity of feeling. Disestablishment might be worse than Free Trade or Household Suffrage, but was not more absolutely opposed to Conservative convictions than had been those great measures. And yet the party, as a party, had swallowed them both. To the first and lesser evil, a compact little body of staunch Commoners had stood forth in opposition,--but nothing had come of it to those true Britons beyond a feeling of living in the cold shade of exclusion. When the greater evil arrived, that of Household Suffrage,--a measure which twenty years since would hardly have been advocated by the advanced Liberals of the day,--the Conservatives had learned to acknowledge the folly of clinging to their own convictions, and had swallowed the dose without serious disruption of their ranks. Every man,--with but an exception or two,--took the measure up, some with faces so singularly distorted as to create true pity, some with an assumption of indifference, some with affected glee. But in the double process the party had become used to this mode of carrying on the public service. As poor old England must go to the dogs, as the doom had been pronounced against the country that it should be ruled by the folly of the many foolish, and not by the wisdom of the few wise, why should the few wise remain out in the cold,--seeing, as they did, that by so doing no good would be done to the country? Dissensions among their foes did, when properly used, give them power,--but such power they could only use by carrying measures which they themselves believed to be ruinous. But the ruin would be as certain should they abstain. Each individual might have gloried in standing aloof,--in hiding his face beneath his toga, and in remembering that Rome did once exist in her splendour. But a party cannot afford to hide its face in its toga. A party has to be practical. A party can only live by having its share of Garters, lord-lieutenants, bishops, and attorney-generals. Though the country were ruined, the party should be supported. Hitherto the party had been supported, and had latterly enjoyed almost its share of stars and Garters,--thanks to the individual skill and strategy of that great English political Von Moltke Mr. Daubeny.</p><p>And now what would the party say about the disestablishment of the Church? Even a party must draw the line somewhere. It was bad to sacrifice things mundane; but this thing was the very Holy of Holies! Was nothing to be conserved by a Conservative party? What if Mr. Daubeny were to explain some day to the electors of East Barsetshire that an hereditary peerage was an absurdity? What if in some rural nook of his Boeotia he should suggest in ambiguous language to the farmers that a Republic was the only form of Government capable of a logical defence? Duke had already said to Duke, and Earl to Earl, and Baronet to Baronet that there must be a line somewhere. Bishops as a rule say but little to each other, and now were afraid to say anything. The Church, which had been, which was, so truly beloved;--surely that must be beyond the line! And yet there crept through the very marrow of the party an agonising belief that Mr. Daubeny would carry the bulk of his party with him into the lobby of the House of Commons.</p><p>But if such was the dismay of the Conservatives, how shall any writer depict the consternation of the Liberals? If there be a feeling odious to the mind of a sober, hardworking man, it is the feeling that the bread he has earned is to be taken out of his mouth. The pay, the patronage, the powers, and the pleasure of Government were all due to the Liberals. &quot;God bless my soul,&quot; said Mr. Ratler, who always saw things in a practical light, &quot;we have a larger fighting majority than any party has had since Lord Liverpool&#39;s time. They have no right to attempt it. They are bound to go out.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s nothing of honesty left in politics,&quot; said Mr. Bonteen, declaring that he was sick of the life. Barrington Erle thought that the whole Liberal party should oppose the measure. Though they were Liberals they were not democrats; nor yet infidels. But when Barrington Erle said this, the great leaders of the Liberal party had not as yet decided on their ground of action.</p><p>There was much difficulty in reaching any decision. It had been asserted so often that the disestablishment of the Church was only a question of time, that the intelligence of the country had gradually so learned to regard it. Who had said so, men did not know and did not inquire;--but the words were spoken everywhere. Parsons with sad hearts,--men who in their own parishes were enthusiastic, pure, pious, and useful,--whispered them in the dead of the night to the wives of their bosoms. Bishops, who had become less pure by contact with the world at clubs, shrugged their shoulders and wagged their heads, and remembered comfortably the sanctity of vested interests. Statesmen listened to them with politeness, and did not deny that they were true. In the free intercourse of closest friendships the matter was discussed between ex-Secretaries of State. The Press teemed with the assertion that it was only a question of time. Some fervent, credulous friends predicted another century of life;--some hard-hearted logical opponents thought that twenty years would put an end to the anomaly:--a few stout enemies had sworn on the hustings with an anathema that the present Session should see the deposition from her high place of this eldest daughter of the woman of Babylon. But none had expected the blow so soon as this; and none certainly had expected it from this hand.</p><p>But what should the Liberal party do? Ratler was for opposing Mr. Daubeny with all their force, without touching the merits of the case. It was no fitting work for Mr. Daubeny, and the suddenness of the proposition coming from such a quarter would justify them now and for ever, even though they themselves should disestablish everything before the Session were over. Barrington Erle, suffering under a real political conviction for once in his life, was desirous of a positive and chivalric defence of the Church. He believed in the twenty years. Mr. Bonteen shut himself up in disgust. Things were amiss; and, as he thought, the evil was due to want of party zeal on the part of his own leader, Mr. Gresham. He did not dare to say this, lest, when the house door should at last be opened, he might not be invited to enter with the others; but such was his conviction. &quot;If we were all a little less in the abstract, and a little more in the concrete, it would be better for us.&quot; Laurence Fitzgibbon, when these words had been whispered to him by Mr. Bonteen, had hardly understood them; but it had been explained to him that his friend had meant &quot;men, not measures.&quot; When Parliament met, Mr. Gresham, the leader of the Liberal party, had not as yet expressed any desire to his general followers.</p><p>The Queen&#39;s Speech was read, and the one paragraph which seemed to possess any great public interest was almost a repetition of the words which Mr. Daubeny had spoken to the electors of East Barsetshire. &quot;It will probably be necessary for you to review the connection which still exists between, and which binds together, the Church and the State.&quot; Mr. Daubeny&#39;s words had of course been more fluent, but the gist of the expression was the same. He had been quite in earnest when addressing his friends in the country. And though there had been but an interval of a few weeks, the Conservative party in the two Houses heard the paragraph read without surprise and without a murmur. Some said that the gentlemen on the Treasury Bench in the House of Commons did not look to be comfortable. Mr. Daubeny sat with his hat over his brow, mute, apparently impassive and unapproachable, during the reading of the Speech and the moving and seconding of the Address. The House was very full, and there was much murmuring on the side of the Opposition;--but from the Government benches hardly a sound was heard, as a young gentleman, from one of the Midland counties, in a deputy-lieutenant&#39;s uniform, who had hitherto been known for no particular ideas of his own, but had been believed to be at any rate true to the Church, explained, not in very clear language, that the time had at length come when the interests of religion demanded a wider support and a fuller sympathy than could be afforded under that system of Church endowment and State establishment for which the country had hitherto been so grateful, and for which the country had such boundless occasion for gratitude. Another gentleman, in the uniform of the Guards, seconded the Address, and declared that in nothing was the sagacity of a Legislature so necessary as in discerning the period in which that which had hitherto been good ceased to be serviceable. The status pupillaris was mentioned, and it was understood that he had implied that England was now old enough to go on in matters of religion without a tutor in the shape of a State Church.</p><p>Who makes the speeches, absolutely puts together the words, which are uttered when the Address is moved and seconded? It can hardly be that lessons are prepared and sent to the noble lords and honourable gentlemen to be learned by heart like a school-boy&#39;s task. And yet, from their construction, style, and general tone,--from the platitudes which they contain as well as from the general safety and good sense of the remarks,--from the absence of any attempt to improve a great occasion by the fire of oratory, one cannot but be convinced that a very absolute control is exercised. The gorgeously apparelled speakers, who seem to have great latitude allowed them in the matter of clothing, have certainly very little in the matter of language. And then it always seems that either of the four might have made the speech of any of the others. It could not have been the case that the Hon. Colonel Mowbray Dick, the Member for West Bustard, had really elaborated out of his own head that theory of the status pupillaris. A better fellow, or a more popular officer, or a sweeter-tempered gentleman than Mowbray Dick does not exist; but he certainly never entertained advanced opinions respecting the religious education of his country. When he is at home with his family, he always goes to church, and there has been an end of it.</p><p>And then the fight began. The thunderbolts of opposition were unloosed, and the fires of political rancour blazed high. Mr. Gresham rose to his legs, and declared to all the world that which he had hitherto kept secret from his own party. It was known afterwards that in discussion with his own dearly-beloved political friend, Lord Cantrip, he had expressed his unbounded anger at the duplicity, greed for power, and want of patriotism displayed by his opponent; but he had acknowledged that the blow had come so quick and so unexpectedly that he thought it better to leave the matter to the House without instruction from himself. He now revelled in sarcasm, and before his speech was over raged into wrath. He would move an amendment to the Address for two reasons,--first because this was no moment for bringing before Parliament the question of the Church establishment, when as yet no well-considered opportunity of expressing itself on the subject had been afforded to the country, and secondly because any measure of reform on that matter should certainly not come to them from the right honourable gentleman opposite. As to the first objection, he should withhold his arguments till the bill suggested had been presented to them. It was in handling the second that he displayed his great power of invective. All those men who then sat in the House, and who on that night crowded the galleries, remember his tones as, turning to the dissenters who usually supported him, and pointing over the table to his opponents, he uttered that well-worn quotation, <em>Quod minime reris</em>,--then he paused, and began again; <em>Quod minime reris,--Graia pandetur ab urbe</em>. The power and inflexion of his voice at the word <em>Graia</em> were certainly very wonderful. He ended by moving an amendment to the Address, and asking for support equally from one side of the House as from the other.</p><p>When at length Mr. Daubeny moved his hat from his brow and rose to his legs he began by expressing his thankfulness that he had not been made a victim to the personal violence of the right honourable gentleman. He continued the same strain of badinage throughout,--in which he was thought to have been wrong, as it was a method of defence, or attack, for which his peculiar powers hardly suited him. As to any bill that was to be laid upon the table, he had not as yet produced it. He did not doubt that the dissenting interests of the country would welcome relief from an anomaly, let it come whence it might, even <em>Graia ab urbe</em>, and he waved his hand back to the clustering Conservatives who sat behind him. That the right honourable gentleman should be angry he could understand, as the return to power of the right honourable gentleman and his party had been anticipated, and he might almost say discounted as a certainty.</p><p>Then, when Mr. Daubeny sat down, the House was adjourned.</p><p>CHAPTER IX.</p><p>THE DEBATE.</p><p>The beginning of the battle as recorded in the last chapter took place on a Friday,--Friday, 11th November,--and consequently two entire days intervened before the debate could be renewed. There seemed to prevail an opinion during this interval that Mr. Gresham had been imprudent. It was acknowledged by all men that no finer speech than that delivered by him had ever been heard within the walls of that House. It was acknowledged also that as regarded the question of oratory Mr. Daubeny had failed signally. But the strategy of the Minister was said to have been excellent, whereas that of the ex-Minister was very loudly condemned. There is nothing so prejudicial to a cause as temper. This man is declared to be unfit for any position of note, because he always shows temper. Anything can be done with another man,--he can be made to fit almost any hole,--because he has his temper under command. It may, indeed, be assumed that a man who loses his temper while he is speaking is endeavouring to speak the truth such as he believes it to be, and again it may be assumed that a man who speaks constantly without losing his temper is not always entitled to the same implicit faith. Whether or not this be a reason the more for preferring the calm and tranquil man may be doubted; but the calm and tranquil man is preferred for public services. We want practical results rather than truth. A clear head is worth more than an honest heart. In a matter of horseflesh of what use is it to have all manner of good gifts if your horse won&#39;t go whither you want him, and refuses to stop when you bid him? Mr. Gresham had been very indiscreet, and had especially sinned in opposing the Address without arrangements with his party.</p><p>And he made the matter worse by retreating within his own shell during the whole of that Saturday, Sunday, and Monday morning. Lord Cantrip was with him three or four times, and he saw both Mr. Palliser, who had been Chancellor of the Exchequer under him, and Mr. Ratler. But he went amidst no congregation of Liberals, and asked for no support. He told Ratler that he wished gentlemen to vote altogether in accordance with their opinions; and it came to be whispered in certain circles that he had resigned, or was resigning, or would resign, the leadership of his party. Men said that his passions were too much for him, and that he was destroyed by feelings of regret, and almost of remorse.</p><p>The Ministers held a Cabinet Council on the Monday morning, and it was supposed afterwards that that also had been stormy. Two gentlemen had certainly resigned their seats in the Government before the House met at four o&#39;clock, and there were rumours abroad that others would do so if the suggested measure should be found really to amount to disestablishment. The rumours were, of course, worthy of no belief, as the transactions of the Cabinet are of necessity secret. Lord Drummond at the War Office, and Mr. Boffin from the Board of Trade, did, however, actually resign; and Mr. Boffin&#39;s explanations in the House were heard before the debate was resumed. Mr. Boffin had certainly not joined the present Ministry,--so he said,--with the view of destroying the Church. He had no other remark to make, and he was sure that the House would appreciate the course which had induced him to seat himself below the gangway. The House cheered very loudly, and Mr. Boffin was the hero of ten minutes. Mr. Daubeny detracted something from this triumph by the overstrained and perhaps ironic pathos with which he deplored the loss of his right honourable friend&#39;s services. Now this right honourable gentleman had never been specially serviceable.</p><p>But the wonder of the world arose from the fact that only two gentlemen out of the twenty or thirty who composed the Government did give up their places on this occasion. And this was a Conservative Government! With what a force of agony did all the Ratlers of the day repeat that inappropriate name! Conservatives! And yet they were ready to abandon the Church at the bidding of such a man as Mr. Daubeny! Ratler himself almost felt that he loved the Church. Only two resignations;--whereas it had been expected that the whole House would fall to pieces! Was it possible that these earls, that marquis, and the two dukes, and those staunch old Tory squires, should remain in a Government pledged to disestablish the Church? Was all the honesty, all the truth of the great party confined to the bosoms of Mr. Boffin and Lord Drummond? Doubtless they were all Esaus; but would they sell their great birthright for so very small a mess of pottage? The parsons in the country, and the little squires who but rarely come up to London, spoke of it all exactly as did the Ratlers. There were parishes in the country in which Mr. Boffin was canonised, though up to that date no Cabinet Minister could well have been less known to fame than was Mr. Boffin.</p><p>What would those Liberals do who would naturally rejoice in the disestablishment of the Church,--those members of the Lower House, who had always spoken of the ascendancy of Protestant episcopacy with the bitter acrimony of exclusion? After all, the success or failure of Mr. Daubeny must depend, not on his own party, but on them. It must always be so when measures of Reform are advocated by a Conservative Ministry. There will always be a number of untrained men ready to take the gift without looking at the giver. They have not expected relief from the hands of Greeks, but will take it when it comes from Greeks or Trojans. What would Mr. Turnbull say in this debate,--and what Mr. Monk? Mr. Turnbull was the people&#39;s tribune, of the day; Mr. Monk had also been a tribune, then a Minister, and now was again--something less than a tribune. But there were a few men in the House, and some out of it, who regarded Mr. Monk as the honestest and most patriotic politician of the day.</p><p>The debate was long and stormy, but was peculiarly memorable for the skill with which Mr. Daubeny&#39;s higher colleagues defended the steps they were about to take. The thing was to be done in the cause of religion. The whole line of defence was indicated by the gentlemen who moved and seconded the Address. An active, well-supported Church was the chief need of a prosperous and intelligent people. As to the endowments, there was some confusion of ideas; but nothing was to be done with them inappropriate to religion. Education would receive the bulk of what was left after existing interests had been amply guaranteed. There would be no doubt,--so said these gentlemen,--that ample funds for the support of an Episcopal Church would come from those wealthy members of the body to whom such a Church was dear. There seemed to be a conviction that clergymen under the new order of things would be much better off than under the old. As to the connection with the State, the time for it had clearly gone by. The Church, as a Church, would own increased power when it could appoint its own bishops, and be wholly dissevered from State patronage. It seemed to be almost a matter of surprise that really good Churchmen should have endured so long to be shackled by subservience to the State. Some of these gentlemen pleaded their cause so well that they almost made it appear that episcopal ascendancy would be restored in England by the disseverance of the Church and State.</p><p>Mr. Turnbull, who was himself a dissenter, was at last upon his legs, and then the Ratlers knew that the game was lost. It would be lost as far as it could be lost by a majority in that House on that motion; and it was by that majority or minority that Mr. Daubeny would be maintained in his high office or ejected from it. Mr. Turnbull began by declaring that he did not at all like Mr. Daubeny as a Minister of the Crown. He was not in the habit of attaching himself specially to any Minister of the Crown. Experience had taught him to doubt them all. Of all possible Ministers of the Crown at this period, Mr. Daubeny was he thought perhaps the worst, and the most dangerous. But the thing now offered was too good to be rejected, let it come from what quarter it would. Indeed, might it not be said of all the good things obtained for the people, of all really serviceable reforms, that they were gathered and garnered home in consequence of the squabbles of Ministers? When men wanted power, either to grasp at it or to retain it, then they offered bribes to the people. But in the taking of such bribes there was no dishonesty, and he should willingly take this bribe.</p><p>Mr. Monk spoke also. He would not, he said, feel himself justified in refusing the Address to the Crown proposed by Ministers, simply because that Address was founded on the proposition of a future reform, as to the expediency of which he had not for many years entertained a doubt. He could not allow it to be said of him that he had voted for the permanence of the Church establishment, and he must therefore support the Government. Then Ratler whispered a few words to his neighbour: &quot;I knew the way he&#39;d run when Gresham insisted on poor old Mildmay&#39;s taking him into the Cabinet.&quot; &quot;The whole thing has gone to the dogs,&quot; said Bonteen. On the fourth night the House was divided, and Mr. Daubeny was the owner of a majority of fifteen.</p><p>Very many of the Liberal party expressed an opinion that the battle had been lost through the want of judgment evinced by Mr. Gresham. There was certainly no longer that sturdy adherence to their chief which is necessary for the solidarity of a party. Perhaps no leader of the House was ever more devoutly worshipped by a small number of adherents than was Mr. Gresham now; but such worship will not support power. Within the three days following the division the Ratlers had all put their heads together and had resolved that the Duke of St. Bungay was now the only man who could keep the party together. &quot;But who should lead our House?&quot; asked Bonteen. Ratler sighed instead of answering. Things had come to that pass that Mr. Gresham was the only possible leader. And the leader of the House of Commons, on behalf of the Government, must be the chief man in the Government, let the so-called Prime Minister be who he may.</p><p>CHAPTER X.</p><p>THE DESERTED HUSBAND.</p><p>Phineas Finn had been in the gallery of the House throughout the debate, and was greatly grieved at Mr. Daubeny&#39;s success, though he himself had so strongly advocated the disestablishment of the Church in canvassing the electors of Tankerville. No doubt he had advocated the cause,--but he had done so as an advanced member of the Liberal party, and he regarded the proposition when coming from Mr. Daubeny as a horrible and abnormal birth. He, however, was only a looker-on,--could be no more than a looker-on for the existing short session. It had already been decided that the judge who was to try the case at Tankerville should visit that town early in January; and should it be decided on a scrutiny that the seat belonged to our hero, then he would enter upon his privilege in the following Session without any further trouble to himself at Tankerville. Should this not be the case,--then the abyss of absolute vacuity would be open before him. He would have to make some disposition of himself, but he would be absolutely without an idea as to the how or where. He was in possession of funds to support himself for a year or two; but after that, and even during that time, all would be dark. If he should get his seat, then again the power of making an effort would at last be within his hands.</p><p>He had made up his mind to spend the Christmas with Lord Brentford and Lady Laura Kennedy at Dresden, and had already fixed the day of his arrival there. But this had been postponed by another invitation which had surprised him much, but which it had been impossible for him not to accept. It had come as follows:--</p><p>November 9th, Loughlinter.</p><p>DEAR SIR,</p><p>I am informed by letter from Dresden that you are in London on your way to that city with the view of spending some days with the Earl of Brentford. You will, of course, be once more thrown into the society of my wife, Lady Laura Kennedy.</p><p>I have never understood, and certainly have never sanctioned, that breach of my wife&#39;s marriage vow which has led to her withdrawal from my roof. I never bade her go, and I have bidden her return. Whatever may be her feelings, or mine, her duty demands her presence here, and my duty calls upon me to receive her. This I am and always have been ready to do. Were the laws of Europe sufficiently explicit and intelligible I should force her to return to my house,--because she sins while she remains away, and I should sin were I to omit to use any means which the law might place in my hands for the due control of my own wife. I am very explicit to you although we have of late been strangers, because in former days you were closely acquainted with the condition of my family affairs.</p><p>Since my wife left me I have had no means of communicating with her by the assistance of any common friend. Having heard that you are about to visit her at Dresden I feel a great desire to see you that I may be enabled to send by you a personal message. My health, which is now feeble, and the altered habits of my life render it almost impossible that I should proceed to London with this object, and I therefore ask it of your Christian charity that you should visit me here at Loughlinter. You, as a Roman Catholic, cannot but hold the bond of matrimony to be irrefragable. You cannot, at least, think that it should be set aside at the caprice of an excitable woman who is not able and never has been able to assign any reason for leaving the protection of her husband.</p><p>I shall have much to say to you, and I trust you will come. I will not ask you to prolong your visit, as I have nothing to offer you in the way of amusement. My mother is with me; but otherwise I am alone. Since my wife left me I have not thought it even decent to entertain guests or to enjoy society. I have lived a widowed life. I cannot even offer you shooting, as I have no keepers on the mountains. There are fish in the river doubtless, for the gifts of God are given let men be ever so unworthy; but this, I believe, is not the month for fishermen. I ask you to come to me, not as a pleasure, but as a Christian duty.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>ROBERT KENNEDY.</p><p>Phineas Finn, Esq.</p><p>As soon as he had read the letter Phineas felt that he had no alternative but to go. The visit would be very disagreeable, but it must be made. So he sent a line to Robert Kennedy naming a day; and wrote another to Lady Laura postponing his time at Dresden by a week, and explaining the cause of its postponement. As soon as the debate on the Address was over he started for Loughlinter.</p><p>A thousand memories crowded on his brain as he made the journey. Various circumstances had in his early life,--in that period of his life which had lately seemed to be cut off from the remainder of his days by so clear a line,--thrown him into close connection with this man, and with the man&#39;s wife. He had first gone to Loughlinter, not as Lady Laura&#39;s guest,--for Lady Laura had not then been married, or even engaged to be married,--but on her persuasion rather than on that of Mr. Kennedy. When there he had asked Lady Laura to be his own wife, and she had then told him that she was to become the wife of the owner of that domain. He remembered the blow as though it had been struck but yesterday, and yet the pain of the blow had not been long enduring. But though then rejected he had always been the chosen friend of the woman,--a friend chosen after an especial fashion. When he had loved another woman this friend had resented his defection with all a woman&#39;s jealousy. He had saved the husband&#39;s life, and had then become also the husband&#39;s friend, after that cold fashion which an obligation will create. Then the husband had been jealous, and dissension had come, and the ill-matched pair had been divided, with absolute ruin to both of them, as far as the material comforts and well-being of life were concerned. Then he, too, had been ejected, as it were, out of the world, and it had seemed to him as though Laura Standish and Robert Kennedy had been the inhabitants of another hemisphere. Now he was about to see them both again, both separately; and to become the medium of some communication between them. He knew, or thought that he knew, that no communication could avail anything.</p><p>It was dark night when he was driven up to the door of Loughlinter House in a fly from the town of Callender. When he first made the journey, now some six or seven years since, he had done so with Mr. Ratler, and he remembered well that circumstance. He remembered also that on his arrival Lady Laura had scolded him for having travelled in such company. She had desired him to seek other friends,--friends higher in general estimation, and nobler in purpose. He had done so, partly at her instance, and with success. But Mr. Ratler was now somebody in the world, and he was nobody. And he remembered also how on that occasion he had been troubled in his mind in regard to a servant, not as yet knowing whether the usages of the world did or did not require that he should go so accompanied. He had taken the man, and had been thoroughly ashamed of himself for doing so. He had no servant now, no grandly developed luggage, no gun, no elaborate dress for the mountains. On that former occasion his heart had been very full when he reached Loughlinter, and his heart was full now. Then he had resolved to say a few words to Lady Laura, and he had hardly known how best to say them. Now he would be called upon to say a few to Lady Laura&#39;s husband, and the task would be almost as difficult.</p><p>The door was opened for him by an old servant in black, who proposed at once to show him to his room. He looked round the vast hall, which, when he had before known it, was ever filled with signs of life, and felt at once that it was empty and deserted. It struck him as intolerably cold, and he saw that the huge fireplace was without a spark of fire. Dinner, the servant said, was prepared for half-past seven. Would Mr. Finn wish to dress? Of course he wished to dress. And as it was already past seven he hurried up stairs to his room. Here again everything was cold and wretched. There was no fire, and the man had left him with a single candle. There were candlesticks on the dressing-table, but they were empty. The man had suggested hot water, but the hot water did not come. In his poorest days he had never known discomfort such as this, and yet Mr. Kennedy was one of the richest commoners of Great Britain.</p><p>But he dressed, and made his way down stairs, not knowing where he should find his host or his host&#39;s mother. He recognised the different doors and knew the rooms within them, but they seemed inhospitably closed against him, and he went and stood in the cold hall. But the man was watching for him, and led him into a small parlour. Then it was explained to him that Mr. Kennedy&#39;s state of health did not admit of late dinners. He was to dine alone, and Mr. Kennedy would receive him after dinner. In a moment his cheeks became red, and a flash of wrath crossed his heart. Was he to be treated in this way by a man on whose behalf,--with no thought of his own comfort or pleasure,--he had made this long and abominable journey? Might it not be well for him to leave the house without seeing Mr. Kennedy at all? Then he remembered that he had heard it whispered that the man had become bewildered in his mind. He relented, therefore, and condescended to eat his dinner.</p><p>A very poor dinner it was. There was a morsel of flabby white fish, as to the nature of which Phineas was altogether in doubt, a beef steak as to the nature of which he was not at all in doubt, and a little crumpled-up tart which he thought the driver of the fly must have brought with him from the pastry-cook&#39;s at Callender. There was some very hot sherry, but not much of it. And there was a bottle of claret, as to which Phineas, who was not usually particular in the matter of wine, persisted in declining to have anything to do with it after the first attempt. The gloomy old servant, who stuck to him during the repast, persisted in offering it, as though the credit of the hospitality of Loughlinter depended on it. There are so many men by whom the tenuis ratio saporum has not been achieved, that the Caleb Balderstones of those houses in which plenty does not flow are almost justified in hoping that goblets of Gladstone may pass current. Phineas Finn was not a martyr to eating or drinking. He played with his fish without thinking much about it. He worked manfully at the steak. He gave another crumple to the tart, and left it without a pang. But when the old man urged him, for the third time, to take that pernicious draught with his cheese, he angrily demanded a glass of beer. The old man toddled out of the room, and on his return he proffered to him a diminutive glass of white spirit, which he called usquebaugh. Phineas, happy to get a little whisky, said nothing more about the beer, and so the dinner was over.</p><p>He rose so suddenly from his chair that the man did not dare to ask him whether he would not sit over his wine. A suggestion that way was indeed made, would he &quot;visit the laird out o&#39; hand, or would he bide awee?&quot; Phineas decided on visiting the laird out of hand, and was at once led across the hall, down a back passage which he had never before traversed, and introduced to the chamber which had ever been known as the &quot;laird&#39;s ain room.&quot; Here Robert Kennedy rose to receive him.</p><p>Phineas knew the man&#39;s age well. He was still under fifty, but he looked as though he were seventy. He had always been thin, but he was thinner now than ever. He was very grey, and stooped so much, that though he came forward a step or two to greet his guest, it seemed as though he had not taken the trouble to raise himself to his proper height. &quot;You find me a much altered man,&quot; he said. The change had been so great that it was impossible to deny it, and Phineas muttered something of regret that his host&#39;s health should be so bad. &quot;It is trouble of the mind,--not of the body, Mr. Finn. It is her doing,--her doing. Life is not to me a light thing, nor are the obligations of life light. When I married a wife, she became bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. Can I lose my bones and my flesh,--knowing that they are not with God but still subject elsewhere to the snares of the devil, and live as though I were a sound man? Had she died I could have borne it. I hope they have made you comfortable, Mr. Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;Not that Loughlinter can be comfortable now to any one. How can a man, whose wife has deserted him, entertain his guests? I am ashamed even to look a friend in the face, Mr. Finn.&quot; As he said this he stretched forth his open hand as though to hide his countenance, and Phineas hardly knew whether the absurdity of the movement or the tragedy of the feeling struck him the more forcibly. &quot;What did I do that she should leave me? Did I strike her? Was I faithless? Had she not the half of all that was mine? Did I frighten her by hard words, or exact hard tasks? Did I not commune with her, telling her all my most inward purposes? In things of this world, and of that better world that is coming, was she not all in all to me? Did I not make her my very wife? Mr. Finn, do you know what made her go away?&quot; He had asked perhaps a dozen questions. As to the eleven which came first it was evident that no answer was required; and they had been put with that pathetic dignity with which it is so easy to invest the interrogatory form of address. But to the last question it was intended that Phineas should give an answer, as Phineas presumed at once; and then it was asked with a wink of the eye, a low eager voice, and a sly twist of the face that were frightfully ludicrous. &quot;I suppose you do know,&quot; said Mr. Kennedy, again working his eye, and thrusting his chin forward.</p><p>[Illustration: The Laird of Loughlinter.]</p><p>&quot;I imagine that she was not happy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Happy? What right had she to expect to be happy? Are we to believe that we should be happy here? Are we not told that we are to look for happiness there, and to hope for none below?&quot; As he said this he stretched his left hand to the ceiling. &quot;But why shouldn&#39;t she have been happy? What did she want? Did she ever say anything against me, Mr. Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing but this,--that your temper and hers were incompatible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought at one time that you advised her to go away?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never!&quot;</p><p>&quot;She told you about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not, if I remember, till she had made up her mind, and her father had consented to receive her. I had known, of course, that things were unpleasant.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How were they unpleasant? Why were they unpleasant? She wouldn&#39;t let you come and dine with me in London. I never knew why that was. When she did what was wrong, of course I had to tell her. Who else should tell her but her husband? If you had been her husband, and I only an acquaintance, then I might have said what I pleased. They rebel against the yoke because it is a yoke. And yet they accept the yoke, knowing it to be a yoke. It comes of the devil. You think a priest can put everything right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;Nothing can put you right but the fear of God; and when a woman is too proud to ask for that, evils like these are sure to come. She would not go to church on Sunday afternoon, but had meetings of Belial at her father&#39;s house instead.&quot; Phineas well remembered those meetings of Belial, in which he with others had been wont to discuss the political prospects of the day. &quot;When she persisted in breaking the Lord&#39;s commandment, and defiling the Lord&#39;s day, I knew well what would come of it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am not sure, Mr. Kennedy, that a husband is justified in demanding that a wife shall think just as he thinks on matters of religion. If he is particular about it, he should find all that out before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Particular! God&#39;s word is to be obeyed, I suppose?&quot;</p><p>&quot;But people doubt about God&#39;s word.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then people will be damned,&quot; said Mr. Kennedy, rising from his chair. &quot;And they will be damned.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A woman doesn&#39;t like to be told so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I never told her so. I never said anything of the kind. I never spoke a hard word to her in my life. If her head did but ache, I hung over her with the tenderest solicitude. I refused her nothing. When I found that she was impatient I chose the shortest sermon for our Sunday evening&#39;s worship, to the great discomfort of my mother.&quot; Phineas wondered whether this assertion as to the discomfort of old Mrs. Kennedy could possibly be true. Could it be that any human being really preferred a long sermon to a short one,--except the being who preached it or read it aloud? &quot;There was nothing that I did not do for her. I suppose you really do know why she went away, Mr. Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know nothing more than I have said.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did think once that she was--&quot;</p><p>&quot;There was nothing more than I have said,&quot; asserted Phineas sternly, fearing that the poor insane man was about to make some suggestion that would be terribly painful. &quot;She felt that she did not make you happy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did not want her to make me happy. I do not expect to be made happy. I wanted her to do her duty. You were in love with her once, Mr. Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I was. I was in love with Lady Laura Standish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah! Yes. There was no harm in that, of course; only when any thing of that kind happens, people had better keep out of each other&#39;s way afterwards. Not that I was ever jealous, you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I should hope not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But I don&#39;t see why you should go all the way to Dresden to pay her a visit. What good can that do? I think you had much better stay where you are, Mr. Finn; I do indeed. It isn&#39;t a decent thing for a young unmarried man to go half across Europe to see a lady who is separated from her husband, and who was once in love with him;--I mean he was once in love with her. It&#39;s a very wicked thing, Mr. Finn, and I have to beg that you will not do it.&quot;</p><p>Phineas felt that he had been grossly taken in. He had been asked to come to Loughlinter in order that he might take a message from the husband to the wife, and now the husband made use of his compliance to forbid the visit on some grotesque score of jealousy. He knew that the man was mad, and that therefore he ought not to be angry; but the man was not too mad to require a rational answer, and had some method in his madness. &quot;Lady Laura Kennedy is living with her father,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;Pshaw;--dotard!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lady Laura Kennedy is living with her father,&quot; repeated Phineas; &quot;and I am going to the house of the Earl of Brentford.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who was it wrote and asked you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The letter was from Lady Laura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes;--from my wife. What right had my wife to write to you when she will not even answer my appeals? She is my wife;--my wife! In the presence of God she and I have been made one, and even man&#39;s ordinances have not dared to separate us. Mr. Finn, as the husband of Lady Laura Kennedy, I desire that you abstain from seeking her presence.&quot; As he said this he rose from his chair, and took the poker in his hand. The chair in which he was sitting was placed upon the rug, and it might be that the fire required his attention. As he stood bending down, with the poker in his right hand, with his eye still fixed on his guest&#39;s face, his purpose was doubtful. The motion might be a threat, or simply have a useful domestic tendency. But Phineas, believing that the man was mad, rose from his seat and stood upon his guard. The point of the poker had undoubtedly been raised; but as Phineas stretched himself to his height, it fell gradually towards the fire, and at last was buried very gently among the coals. But he was never convinced that Mr. Kennedy had carried out the purpose with which he rose from his chair. &quot;After what has passed, you will no doubt abandon your purpose,&quot; said Mr. Kennedy.</p><p>&quot;I shall certainly go to Dresden,&quot; said Phineas. &quot;If you have a message to send, I will take it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then you will be accursed among adulterers,&quot; said the laird of Loughlinter. &quot;By such a one I will send no message. From the first moment that I saw you I knew you for a child of Apollyon. But the sin was my own. Why did I ask to my house an idolater, one who pretends to believe that a crumb of bread is my God, a Papist, untrue alike to his country and to his Saviour? When she desired it of me I knew that I was wrong to yield. Yes;--it is you who have done it all, you, you, you;--and if she be a castaway, the weight of her soul will be doubly heavy on your own.&quot;</p><p>To get out of the room, and then at the earliest possible hour of the morning out of the house, were now the objects to be attained. That his presence had had a peculiarly evil influence on Mr. Kennedy, Phineas could not doubt; as assuredly the unfortunate man would not have been left with mastery over his own actions had his usual condition been such as that which he now displayed. He had been told that &quot;poor Kennedy&quot; was mad,--as we are often told of the madness of our friends when they cease for awhile to run in the common grooves of life. But the madman had now gone a long way out of the grooves;--so far, that he seemed to Phineas to be decidedly dangerous. &quot;I think I had better wish you good night,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Look here, Mr. Finn.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I hope you won&#39;t go and make more mischief.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall not do that, certainly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You won&#39;t tell her what I have said?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall tell her nothing to make her think that your opinion of her is less high than it ought to be.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good night,&quot; said Phineas again; and then he left the room. It was as yet but nine o&#39;clock, and he had no alternative but to go to bed. He found his way back into the hall, and from thence up to his own chamber. But there was no fire there, and the night was cold. He went to the window, and raised it for a moment, that he might hear the well-remembered sound of the Fall of Linter. Though the night was dark and wintry, a dismal damp November night, he would have crept out of the house and made his way up to the top of the brae, for the sake of auld lang syne, had he not feared that the inhospitable mansion would be permanently closed against him on his return. He rang the bell once or twice, and after a while the old serving man came to him. Could he have a cup of tea? The man shook his head, and feared that no boiling water could be procured at that late hour of the night. Could he have his breakfast the next morning at seven, and a conveyance to Callender at half-past seven? When the old man again shook his head, seeming to be dazed at the enormity of the demand, Phineas insisted that his request should be conveyed to the master of the house. As to the breakfast, he said he did not care about it, but the conveyance he must have. He did, in fact, obtain both, and left the house early on the following morning without again seeing Mr. Kennedy, and without having spoken a single word to Mr. Kennedy&#39;s mother. And so great was his hurry to get away from the place which had been so disagreeable to him, and which he thought might possibly become more so, that he did not even run across the sward that divided the gravel sweep from the foot of the waterfall.</p><p>CHAPTER XI.</p><p>THE TRUANT WIFE.</p><p>Phineas on his return to London wrote a line to Lady Chiltern in accordance with a promise which had been exacted from him. She was anxious to learn something as to the real condition of her husband&#39;s brother-in-law, and, when she heard that Phineas was going to Loughlinter, had begged that he would tell her the truth. &quot;He has become eccentric, gloomy, and very strange,&quot; said Phineas. &quot;I do not believe that he is really mad, but his condition is such that I think no friend should recommend Lady Laura to return to him. He seems to have devoted himself to a gloomy religion,--and to the saving of money. I had but one interview with him, and that was essentially disagreeable.&quot; Having remained two days in London, and having participated, as far as those two days would allow him, in the general horror occasioned by the wickedness and success of Mr. Daubeny, he started for Dresden.</p><p>He found Lord Brentford living in a spacious house, with a huge garden round it, close upon the northern confines of the town. Dresden, taken altogether, is a clean cheerful city, and strikes the stranger on his first entrance as a place in which men are gregarious, busy, full of merriment, and pre-eminently social. Such is the happy appearance of but few towns either in the old or the new world, and is hardly more common in Germany than elsewhere. Leipsic is decidedly busy, but does not look to be social. Vienna is sufficiently gregarious, but its streets are melancholy. Munich is social, but lacks the hum of business. Frankfort is both practical and picturesque, but it is dirty, and apparently averse to mirth. Dresden has much to recommend it, and had Lord Brentford with his daughter come abroad in quest of comfortable easy social life, his choice would have been well made. But, as it was, any of the towns above named would have suited him as well as Dresden, for he saw no society, and cared nothing for the outward things of the world around him. He found Dresden to be very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer, and he liked neither heat nor cold; but he had made up his mind that all places, and indeed all things, are nearly equally disagreeable, and therefore he remained at Dresden, grumbling almost daily as to the climate and manners of the people.</p><p>Phineas, when he arrived at the hall door, almost doubted whether he had not been as wrong in visiting Lord Brentford as he had in going to Loughlinter. His friendship with the old Earl had been very fitful, and there had been quarrels quite as pronounced as the friendship. He had often been happy in the Earl&#39;s house, but the happiness had not sprung from any love for the man himself. How would it be with him if he found the Earl hardly more civil to him than the Earl&#39;s son-in-law had been? In former days the Earl had been a man quite capable of making himself disagreeable, and probably had not yet lost the power of doing so. Of all our capabilities this is the one which clings longest to us. He was thinking of all this when he found himself at the door of the Earl&#39;s house. He had travelled all night, and was very cold. At Leipsic there had been a nominal twenty minutes for refreshment, which the circumstances of the station had reduced to five. This had occurred very early in the morning, and had sufficed only to give him a bowl of coffee. It was now nearly ten, and breakfast had become a serious consideration with him. He almost doubted whether it would not have been better for him to have gone to an hotel in the first instance.</p><p>He soon found himself in the hall amidst a cluster of servants, among whom he recognised the face of a man from Saulsby. He had, however, little time allowed him for looking about. He was hardly in the house before Lady Laura Kennedy was in his arms. She had run forward, and before he could look into her face, she had put up her cheek to his lips and had taken both his hands. &quot;Oh, my friend,&quot; she said; &quot;oh, my friend! How good you are to come to me! How good you are to come!&quot; And then she led him into a large room, in which a table had been prepared for breakfast, close to an English-looking open fire. &quot;How cold you must be, and how hungry! Shall I have breakfast for you at once, or will you dress first? You are to be quite at home, you know; exactly as though we were brother and sister. You are not to stand on any ceremonies.&quot; And again she took him by the hand. He had hardly looked her yet in the face, and he could not do so now because he knew that she was crying. &quot;Then I will show you to your room,&quot; she said, when he had decided for a tub of water before breakfast. &quot;Yes, I will,--my own self. And I&#39;d fetch the water for you, only I know it is there already. How long will you be? Half an hour? Very well. And you would like tea best, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly, I should like tea best.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will make it for you. Papa never comes down till near two, and we shall have all the morning for talking. Oh, Phineas, it is such a pleasure to hear your voice again. You have been at Loughlinter?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I have been there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How very good of you; but I won&#39;t ask a question now. You must put up with a stove here, as we have not open fires in the bed-rooms. I hope you will be comfortable. Don&#39;t be more than half an hour, as I shall be impatient.&quot;</p><p>Though he was thus instigated to haste he stood a few minutes with his back to the warm stove that he might be enabled to think of it all. It was two years since he had seen this woman, and when they had parted there had been more between them of the remembrances of old friendship than of present affection. During the last few weeks of their intimacy she had made a point of telling him that she intended to separate herself from her husband; but she had done so as though it were a duty, and an arranged part of her own defence of her own conduct. And in the latter incidents of her London life,--that life with which he had been conversant,--she had generally been opposed to him, or, at any rate, had chosen to be divided from him. She had said severe things to him,--telling him that he was cold, heartless, and uninterested, never trying even to please him with that sort of praise which had once been so common with her in her intercourse with him, and which all men love to hear from the mouths of women. She had then been cold to him, though she would make wretched allusions to the time when he, at any rate, had not been cold to her. She had reproached him, and had at the same time turned away from him. She had repudiated him, first as a lover, then as a friend; and he had hitherto never been able to gauge the depth of the affection for him which had underlaid all her conduct. As he stood there thinking of it all, he began to understand it.</p><p>How natural had been her conduct on his arrival, and how like that of a genuine, true-hearted, honest woman! All her first thoughts had been for his little personal wants,--that he should be warmed, and fed, and made outwardly comfortable. Let sorrow be ever so deep, and love ever so true, a man will be cold who travels by winter, and hungry who has travelled by night. And a woman, who is a true, genuine woman, always takes delight in ministering to the natural wants of her friend. To see a man eat and drink, and wear his slippers, and sit at ease in his chair, is delightful to the feminine heart that loves. When I heard the other day that a girl had herself visited the room prepared for a man in her mother&#39;s house, then I knew that she loved him, though I had never before believed it. Phineas, as he stood there, was aware that this woman loved him dearly. She had embraced him, and given her face to him to kiss. She had clasped his hands, and clung to him, and had shown him plainly that in the midst of all her sorrow she could be made happy by his coming. But he was a man far too generous to take all this as meaning aught that it did not mean,--too generous, and intrinsically too manly. In his character there was much of weakness, much of vacillation, perhaps some deficiency of strength and purpose; but there was no touch of vanity. Women had loved him, and had told him so; and he had been made happy, and also wretched, by their love. But he had never taken pride, personally, to himself because they had loved him. It had been the accident of his life. Now he remembered chiefly that this woman had called herself his sister, and he was grateful.</p><p>Then he thought of her personal appearance. As yet he had hardly looked at her, but he felt that she had become old and worn, angular and hard-visaged. All this had no effect upon his feelings towards her, but filled him with ineffable regret. When he had first known her she had been a woman with a noble presence--not soft and feminine as had been Violet Effingham, but handsome and lustrous, with a healthy youth. In regard to age he and she were of the same standing. That he knew well. She had passed her thirty-second birthday, but that was all. He felt himself to be still a young man, but he could not think of her as of a young woman.</p><p>When he went down she had been listening for his footsteps, and met him at the door of the room. &quot;Now sit down,&quot; she said, &quot;and be comfortable--if you can, with German surroundings. They are almost always late, and never give one any time. Everybody says so. The station at Leipsic is dreadful, I know. Good coffee is very well, but what is the use of good coffee if you have no time to drink it? You must eat our omelette. If there is one thing we can do better than you it is to make an omelette. Yes,--that is genuine German sausage. There is always some placed upon the table, but the Germans who come here never touch it themselves. You will have a cutlet, won&#39;t you? I breakfasted an hour ago, and more. I would not wait because then I thought I could talk to you better, and wait upon you. I did not think that anything would ever please me so much again as your coming has done. Oh, how much we shall have to say! Do you remember when we last parted;--when you were going back to Ireland?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I remember it well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah me; as I look back upon it all, how strange it seems. I dare say you don&#39;t remember the first day I met you, at Mr. Mildmay&#39;s,--when I asked you to come to Portman Square because Barrington had said that you were clever?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I remember well going to Portman Square.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That was the beginning of it all. Oh dear, oh dear; when I think of it I find it so hard to see where I have been right, and where I have been wrong. If I had not been very wrong all this evil could not have come upon me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Misfortune has not always been deserved.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am sure it has been so with me. You can smoke here if you like.&quot; This Phineas persistently refused to do. &quot;You may if you please. Papa never comes in here, and I don&#39;t mind it. You&#39;ll settle down in a day or two, and understand the extent of your liberties. Tell me first about Violet. She is happy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Quite happy, I think.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I knew he would be good to her. But does she like the kind of life?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She has a baby, and therefore of course she is happy. She says he is the finest fellow in the world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I dare say he is. They all seem to be contented with him, but they don&#39;t talk much about him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No; they wouldn&#39;t. Had you a child you would have talked about him, Phineas. I should have loved my baby better than all the world, but I should have been silent about him. With Violet of course her husband is the first object. It would certainly be so from her nature. And so Oswald is quite tame?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know that he is very tame out hunting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But to her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I should think always. She, you know, is very clever.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So clever!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And would be sure to steer clear of all offence,&quot; said Phineas, enthusiastically.</p><p>&quot;While I could never for an hour avoid it. Did they say anything about the journey to Flanders?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Chiltern did, frequently. He made me strip my shoulder to show him the place where he hit me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How like Oswald!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And he told me that he would have given one of his eyes to kill me, only Colepepper wouldn&#39;t let him go on. He half quarrelled with his second, but the man told him that I had not fired at him, and the thing must drop. &#39;It&#39;s better as it is, you know,&#39; he said. And I agreed with him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And how did Violet receive you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like an angel,--as she is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, yes. I&#39;ll grant she is an angel now. I was angry with her once, you know. You men find so many angels in your travels. You have been honester than some. You have generally been off with the old angel before you were on with the new,--as far at least as I knew.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is that meant for rebuke, Lady Laura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, my friend; no. That is all over. I said to myself when you told me that you would come, that I would not utter one ill-natured word. And I told myself more than that!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What more?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That you had never deserved it,--at least from me. But surely you were the most simple of men.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I dare say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Men when they are true are simple. They are often false as hell, and then they are crafty as Lucifer. But the man who is true judges others by himself,--almost without reflection. A woman can be true as steel and cunning at the same time. How cunning was Violet, and yet she never deceived one of her lovers, even by a look. Did she?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She never deceived me,--if you mean that. She never cared a straw about me, and told me so to my face very plainly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She did care,--many straws. But I think she always loved Oswald. She refused him again and again, because she thought it wrong to run a great risk, but I knew she would never marry any one else. How little Lady Baldock understood her. Fancy your meeting Lady Baldock at Oswald&#39;s house!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fancy Augusta Boreham turning nun!&quot;</p><p>&quot;How exquisitely grotesque it must have been when she made her complaint to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I pitied her with all my heart.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course you did,--because you are so soft. And now, Phineas, we will put it off no longer. Tell me all that you have to tell me about him.&quot;</p><p>CHAPTER XII.</p><p>KOENIGSTEIN.</p><p>Phineas Finn and Lady Laura Kennedy sat together discussing the affairs of the past till the servant told them that &quot;My Lord&quot; was in the next room, and ready to receive Mr. Finn. &quot;You will find him much altered,&quot; said Lady Laura, &quot;even more than I am.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not find you altered at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, you do,--in appearance. I am a middle-aged woman, and conscious that I may use my privileges as such. But he has become quite an old man,--not in health so much as in manner. But he will be very glad to see you.&quot; So saying she led him into a room, in which he found the Earl seated near the fireplace, and wrapped in furs. He got up to receive his guest, and Phineas saw at once that during the two years of his exile from England Lord Brentford had passed from manhood to senility. He almost tottered as he came forward, and he wrapped his coat around him with that air of studious self-preservation which belongs only to the infirm.</p><p>&quot;It is very good of you to come and see me, Mr. Finn,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t call him Mr. Finn, Papa. I call him Phineas.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, yes; that&#39;s all right, I dare say. It&#39;s a terrible long journey from London, isn&#39;t it, Mr. Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Too long to be pleasant, my lord.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pleasant! Oh, dear. There&#39;s no pleasantness about it. And so they&#39;ve got an autumn session, have they? That&#39;s always a very stupid thing to do, unless they want money.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But there is a money bill which must be passed. That&#39;s Mr. Daubeny&#39;s excuse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, if they&#39;ve a money bill of course it&#39;s all right. So you&#39;re in Parliament again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry to say I&#39;m not.&quot; Then Lady Laura explained to her father, probably for the third or fourth time, exactly what was their guest&#39;s position. &quot;Oh, a scrutiny. We didn&#39;t use to have any scrutinies at Loughton, did we? Ah, me; well, everything seems to be going to the dogs. I&#39;m told they&#39;re attacking the Church now.&quot; Lady Laura glanced at Phineas; but neither of them said a word. &quot;I don&#39;t quite understand it; but they tell me that the Tories are going to disestablish the Church. I&#39;m very glad I&#39;m out of it all. Things have come to such a pass that I don&#39;t see how a gentleman is to hold office now-a-days. Have you seen Chiltern lately?&quot;</p><p>After a while, when Phineas had told the Earl all that there was to tell of his son and his grandson, and all of politics and of Parliament, Lady Laura suddenly interrupted them. &quot;You knew, Papa, that he was to see Mr. Kennedy. He has been to Loughlinter, and has seen him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is quite assured that I could not with wisdom return to live with my husband.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is a very grave decision to make,&quot; said the Earl.</p><p>&quot;But he has no doubt about it,&quot; continued Lady Laura.</p><p>&quot;Not a shadow of doubt,&quot; said Phineas. &quot;I will not say that Mr. Kennedy is mad; but the condition of his mind is such in regard to Lady Laura that I do not think she could live with him in safety. He is crazed about religion.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dear, dear, dear,&quot; exclaimed the Earl.</p><p>&quot;The gloom of his house is insupportable. And he does not pretend that he desires her to return that he and she may be happy together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What for then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That we might be unhappy together,&quot; said Lady Laura.</p><p>&quot;He repudiates all belief in happiness. He wishes her to return to him chiefly because it is right that a man and wife should live together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So it is,&quot; said the Earl.</p><p>&quot;But not to the utter wretchedness of both of them,&quot; said Lady Laura. &quot;He says,&quot; and she pointed to Phineas, &quot;that were I there he would renew his accusation against me. He has not told me all. Perhaps he cannot tell me all. But I certainly will not return to Loughlinter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very well, my dear.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is not very well, Papa; but, nevertheless, I will not return to Loughlinter. What I suffered there neither of you can understand.&quot;</p><p>That afternoon Phineas went out alone to the galleries, but the next day she accompanied him, and showed him whatever of glory the town had to offer in its winter dress. They stood together before great masters, and together examined small gems. And then from day to day they were always in each other&#39;s company. He had promised to stay a month, and during that time he was petted and comforted to his heart&#39;s content. Lady Laura would have taken him into the Saxon Switzerland, in spite of the inclemency of the weather and her father&#39;s rebukes, had he not declared vehemently that he was happier remaining in the town. But she did succeed in carrying him off to the fortress of Koenigstein; and there as they wandered along the fortress constructed on that wonderful rock there occurred between them a conversation which he never forgot, and which it would not have been easy to forget. His own prospects had of course been frequently discussed. He had told her everything, down to the exact amount of money which he had to support him till he should again be enabled to earn an income, and had received assurances from her that everything would be just as it should be after a lapse of a few months. The Liberals would, as a matter of course, come in, and equally as a matter of course, Phineas would be in office. She spoke of this with such certainty that she almost convinced him. Having tempted him away from the safety of permanent income, the party could not do less than provide for him. If he could only secure a seat he would be safe; and it seemed that Tankerville would be a certain seat. This certainty he would not admit; but, nevertheless, he was comforted by his friend. When you have done the rashest thing in the world it is very pleasant to be told that no man of spirit could have acted otherwise. It was a matter of course that he should return to public life,--so said Lady Laura;--and doubly a matter of course when he found himself a widower without a child. &quot;Whether it be a bad life or a good life,&quot; said Lady Laura, &quot;you and I understand equally well that no other life is worth having after it. We are like the actors, who cannot bear to be away from the gaslights when once they have lived amidst their glare.&quot; As she said this they were leaning together over one of the parapets of the great fortress, and the sadness of the words struck him as they bore upon herself. She also had lived amidst the gaslights, and now she was self-banished into absolute obscurity. &quot;You could not have been content with your life in Dublin,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Are you content with your life in Dresden?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly not. We all like exercise; but the man who has had his leg cut off can&#39;t walk. Some can walk with safety; others only with a certain peril; and others cannot at all. You are in the second position, but I am in the last.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not see why you should not return.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And if I did what would come of it? In place of the seclusion of Dresden, there would be the seclusion of Portman Square or of Saulsby. Who would care to have me at their houses, or to come to mine? You know what a hazardous, chancy, short-lived thing is the fashion of a woman. With wealth, and wit, and social charm, and impudence, she may preserve it for some years, but when she has once lost it she can never recover it. I am as much lost to the people who did know me in London as though I had been buried for a century. A man makes himself really useful, but a woman can never do that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All those general rules mean nothing,&quot; said Phineas. &quot;I should try it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Phineas. I know better than that. It would only be disappointment. I hardly think that after all you ever did understand when it was that I broke down utterly and marred my fortunes for ever.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know the day that did it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When I accepted him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course it was. I know that, and so do you. There need be no secret between us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There need be no secret between us certainly,--and on my part there shall be none. On my part there has been none.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nor on mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There has been nothing for you to tell,--since you blurted out your short story of love that day over the waterfall, when I tried so hard to stop you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How was I to be stopped then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No; you were too simple. You came there with but one idea, and you could not change it on the spur of the moment. When I told you that I was engaged you could not swallow back the words that were not yet spoken. Ah, how well I remember it. But you are wrong, Phineas. It was not my engagement or my marriage that has made the world a blank for me.&quot; A feeling came upon him which half-choked him, so that he could ask her no further question. &quot;You know that, Phineas.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was your marriage,&quot; he said, gruffly.</p><p>&quot;It was, and has been, and still will be my strong, unalterable, unquenchable love for you. How could I behave to that other man with even seeming tenderness when my mind was always thinking of you, when my heart was always fixed upon you? But you have been so simple, so little given to vanity,&quot;--she leaned upon his arm as she spoke,--&quot;so pure and so manly, that you have not believed this, even when I told you. Has it not been so?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not wish to believe it now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But you do believe it? You must and shall believe it. I ask for nothing in return. As my God is my judge, if I thought it possible that your heart should be to me as mine is to you, I could have put a pistol to my ear sooner than speak as I have spoken.&quot; Though she paused for some word from him he could not utter a word. He remembered many things, but even to her in his present mood he could not allude to them;--how he had kissed her at the Falls, how she had bade him not come back to the house because his presence to her was insupportable; how she had again encouraged him to come, and had then forbidden him to accept even an invitation to dinner from her husband. And he remembered too the fierceness of her anger to him when he told her of his love for Violet Effingham. &quot;I must insist upon it,&quot; she continued, &quot;that you shall take me now as I really am,--as your dearest friend, your sister, your mother, if you will. I know what I am. Were my husband not still living it would be the same. I should never under any circumstances marry again. I have passed the period of a woman&#39;s life when as a woman she is loved; but I have not outlived the power of loving. I shall fret about you, Phineas, like an old hen after her one chick; and though you turn out to be a duck, and get away into waters where I cannot follow you, I shall go cackling round the pond, and always have my eye upon you.&quot; He was holding her now by the hand, but he could not speak for the tears were trickling down his cheeks. &quot;When I was young,&quot; she continued, &quot;I did not credit myself with capacity for so much passion. I told myself that love after all should be a servant and not a master, and I married my husband fully intending to do my duty to him. Now we see what has come of it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It has been his fault; not yours,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;It was my fault,--mine; for I never loved him. Had you not told me what manner of man he was before? And I had believed you, though I denied it. And I knew when I went to Loughlinter that it was you whom I loved. And I knew too,--I almost knew that you would ask me to be your wife were not that other thing settled first. And I declared to myself that, in spite of both our hearts, it should not be so. I had no money then,--nor had you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I would have worked for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, yes; but you must not reproach me now, Phineas. I never deserted you as regarded your interests, though what little love you had for me was short-lived indeed. Nay; you are not accused, and shall not excuse yourself. You were right,--always right. When you had failed to win one woman your heart with a true natural spring went to another. And so entire had been the cure, that you went to the first woman with the tale of your love for the second.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To whom was I to go but to a friend?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You did come to a friend, and though I could not drive out of my heart the demon of jealousy, though I was cut to the very bone, I would have helped you had help been possible. Though it had been the fixed purpose of my life that Violet and Oswald should be man and wife, I would have helped you because that other purpose of serving you in all things had become more fixed. But it was to no good end that I sang your praises. Violet Effingham was not the girl to marry this man or that at the bidding of any one;--was she?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, indeed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is of no use now talking of it; is it? But I want you to understand me from the beginning;--to understand all that was evil, and anything that was good. Since first I found that you were to me the dearest of human beings I have never once been untrue to your interests, though I have been unable not to be angry with you. Then came that wonderful episode in which you saved my husband&#39;s life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not his life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Was it not singular that it should come from your hand? It seemed like Fate. I tried to use the accident, to make his friendship for you as thorough as my own. And then I was obliged to separate you, because,--because, after all I was so mere a woman that I could not bear to have you near me. I can bear it now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dear Laura!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes; as your sister. I think you cannot but love me a little when you know how entirely I am devoted to you. I can bear to have you near me now and think of you only as the hen thinks of her duckling. For a moment you are out of the pond, and I have gathered you under my wing. You understand?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that I am unworthy of what you say of me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Worth has nothing to do with it,--has no bearing on it. I do not say that you are more worthy than all whom I have known. But when did worth create love? What I want is that you should believe me, and know that there is one bound to you who will never be unbound, one whom you can trust in all things,--one to whom you can confess that you have been wrong if you go wrong, and yet be sure that you will not lessen her regard. And with this feeling you must pretend to nothing more than friendship. You will love again, of course.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, no.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course you will. I tried to blaze into power by a marriage, and I failed,--because I was a woman. A woman should marry only for love. You will do it yet, and will not fail. You may remember this too,--that I shall never be jealous again. You may tell me everything with safety. You will tell me everything?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If there be anything to tell, I will.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will never stand between you and your wife,--though I would fain hope that she should know how true a friend I am. Now we have walked here till it is dark, and the sentry will think we are taking plans of the place. Are you cold?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have not thought about the cold.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nor have I. We will go down to the inn and warm ourselves before the train comes. I wonder why I should have brought you here to tell you my story. Oh, Phineas.&quot; Then she threw herself into his arms, and he pressed her to his heart, and kissed first her forehead and then her lips. &quot;It shall never be so again,&quot; she said. &quot;I will kill it out of my heart even though I should crucify my body. But it is not my love that I will kill. When you are happy I will be happy. When you prosper I will prosper. When you fail I will fail. When you rise,--as you will rise,--I will rise with you. But I will never again feel the pressure of your arm round my waist. Here is the gate, and the old guide. So, my friend, you see that we are not lost.&quot; Then they walked down the very steep hill to the little town below the fortress, and there they remained till the evening train came from Prague, and took them back to Dresden.</p><p>Two days after this was the day fixed for Finn&#39;s departure. On the intermediate day the Earl begged for a few minutes&#39; private conversation with him, and the two were closeted together for an hour. The Earl, in truth, had little or nothing to say. Things had so gone with him that he had hardly a will of his own left, and did simply that which his daughter directed him to do. He pretended to consult Phineas as to the expediency of his returning to Saulsby. Did Phineas think that his return would be of any use to the party? Phineas knew very well that the party would not recognise the difference whether the Earl lived at Dresden or in London. When a man has come to the end of his influence as the Earl had done he is as much a nothing in politics as though he had never risen above that quantity. The Earl had never risen very high, and even Phineas, with all his desire to be civil, could not say that the Earl&#39;s presence would materially serve the interests of the Liberal party. He made what most civil excuses he could, and suggested that if Lord Brentford should choose to return, Lady Laura would very willingly remain at Dresden alone. &quot;But why shouldn&#39;t she come too?&quot; asked the Earl. And then, with the tardiness of old age, he proposed his little plan. &quot;Why should she not make an attempt to live once more with her husband?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She never will,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;But think how much she loses,&quot; said the Earl.</p><p>&quot;I am quite sure she never will. And I am quite sure that she ought not to do so. The marriage was a misfortune. As it is they are better apart.&quot; After that the Earl did not dare to say another word about his daughter; but discussed his son&#39;s affairs. Did not Phineas think that Chiltern might now be induced to go into Parliament? &quot;Nothing would make him do so,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;But he might farm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You see he has his hands full.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But other men keep hounds and farm too,&quot; said the Earl.</p><p>&quot;But Chiltern is not like other men. He gives his whole mind to it, and finds full employment. And then he is quite happy, and so is she. What more can you want for him? Everybody respects him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That goes a very great way,&quot; said the Earl. Then he thanked Phineas cordially, and felt that now as ever he had done his duty by his family.</p><p>There was no renewal of the passionate conversation which had taken place on the ramparts, but much of tenderness and of sympathy arose from it. Lady Laura took upon herself the tone and manners of an elder sister,--of a sister very much older than her brother,--and Phineas submitted to them not only gracefully but with delight to himself. He had not thanked her for her love when she expressed it, and he did not do so afterwards. But he accepted it, and bowed to it, and recognised it as constituting one of the future laws of his life. He was to do nothing of importance without her knowledge, and he was to be at her command should she at any time want assistance in England. &quot;I suppose I shall come back some day,&quot; she said, as they were sitting together late on the evening before his departure.</p><p>&quot;I cannot understand why you should not do so now. Your father wishes it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He thinks he does; but were he told that he was to go to-morrow, or next summer, it would fret him. I am assured that Mr. Kennedy could demand my return,--by law.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He could not enforce it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He would attempt it. I will not go back until he consents to my living apart from him. And, to tell the truth, I am better here for awhile. They say that the sick animals always creep somewhere under cover. I am a sick animal, and now that I have crept here I will remain till I am stronger. How terribly anxious you must be about Tankerville!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am anxious.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You will telegraph to me at once? You will be sure to do that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course I will, the moment I know my fate.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And if it goes against you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah,--what then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall at once write to Barrington Erle. I don&#39;t suppose he would do much now for his poor cousin, but he can at any rate say what can be done. I should bid you come here,--only that stupid people would say that you were my lover. I should not mind, only that he would hear it, and I am bound to save him from annoyance. Would you not go down to Oswald again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;With what object?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because anything will be better than returning to Ireland. Why not go down and look after Saulsby? It would be a home, and you need not tie yourself to it. I will speak to Papa about that. But you will get the seat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think I shall,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;Do;--pray do! If I could only get hold of that judge by the ears! Do you know what time it is? It is twelve, and your train starts at eight.&quot; Then he arose to bid her adieu. &quot;No,&quot; she said; &quot;I shall see you off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed you will not. It will be almost night when I leave this, and the frost is like iron.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Neither the night nor the frost will kill me. Do you think I will not give you your last breakfast? God bless you, dear.&quot;</p><p>And on the following morning she did give him his breakfast by candle-light, and went down with him to the station. The morning was black, and the frost was, as he had said, as hard as iron, but she was thoroughly good-humoured, and apparently happy. &quot;It has been so much to me to have you here, that I might tell you everything,&quot; she said. &quot;You will understand me now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand, but I know not how to believe,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;You do believe. You would be worse than a Jew if you did not believe me. But you understand also. I want you to marry, and you must tell her all the truth. If I can I will love her almost as much as I do you. And if I live to see them, I will love your children as dearly as I do you. Your children shall be my children;--or at least one of them shall be mine. You will tell me when it is to be.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If I ever intend such a thing, I will tell you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now, good-bye. I shall stand back there till the train starts, but do not you notice me. God bless you, Phineas.&quot; She held his hand tight within her own for some seconds, and looked into his face with an unutterable love. Then she drew down her veil, and went and stood apart till the train had left the platform.</p><p>&quot;He has gone, Papa,&quot; Lady Laura said, as she stood afterwards by her father&#39;s bedside.</p><p>&quot;Has he? Yes; I know he was to go, of course. I was very glad to see him, Laura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So was I, Papa;--very glad indeed. Whatever happens to him, we must never lose sight of him again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We shall hear of him, of course, if he is in the House.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whether he is in the House or out of it we must hear of him. While we have aught he must never want.&quot; The Earl stared at his daughter. The Earl was a man of large possessions, and did not as yet understand that he was to be called upon to share them with Phineas Finn. &quot;I know, Papa, you will never think ill of me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never, my dear.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have sworn that I will be a sister to that man, and I will keep my oath.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know you are a very good sister to Chiltern,&quot; said the Earl. Lady Laura had at one time appropriated her whole fortune, which had been large, to the payment of her brother&#39;s debts. The money had been returned, and had gone to her husband. Lord Brentford now supposed that she intended at some future time to pay the debts of Phineas Finn.</p><p>CHAPTER XIII.</p><p>&quot;I HAVE GOT THE SEAT.&quot;</p><p>When Phineas returned to London, the autumn Session, though it had been carried on so near to Christmas as to make many members very unhappy, had already been over for a fortnight. Mr. Daubeny had played his game with consummate skill to the last. He had brought in no bill, but had stated his intention of doing so early in the following Session. He had, he said, of course been aware from the first that it would have been quite impossible to carry such a measure as that proposed during the few weeks in which it had been possible for them to sit between the convening of Parliament and the Christmas holidays; but he thought that it was expedient that the proposition should be named to the House and ventilated as it had been, so that members on both sides might be induced to give their most studious attention to the subject before a measure, which must be so momentous, should be proposed to them. As had happened, the unforeseen division to which the House had been pressed on the Address had proved that the majority of the House was in favour of the great reform which it was the object of his ambition to complete. They were aware that they had been assembled at a somewhat unusual and inconvenient period of the year, because the service of the country had demanded that certain money bills should be passed. He, however, rejoiced greatly that this earliest opportunity had been afforded to him of explaining the intentions of the Government with which he had the honour of being connected. In answer to this there arose a perfect torrent of almost vituperative antagonism from the opposite side of the House. Did the Right Honourable gentleman dare to say that the question had been ventilated in the country, when it had never been broached by him or any of his followers till after the general election had been completed? Was it not notorious to the country that the first hint of it had been given when the Right Honourable gentleman was elected for East Barsetshire, and was it not equally notorious that that election had been so arranged that the marvellous proposition of the Right Honourable gentleman should not be known even to his own party till there remained no possibility of the expression of any condemnation from the hustings? It might be that the Right Honourable could so rule his own followers in that House as to carry them with him even in a matter so absolutely opposite to their own most cherished convictions. It certainly seemed that he had succeeded in doing so for the present. But would any one believe that he would have carried the country, had he dared to face the country with such a measure in his hands? Ventilation, indeed! He had not dared to ventilate his proposition. He had used this short Session in order that he might keep his clutch fastened on power, and in doing so was indifferent alike to the Constitution, to his party, and to the country. Harder words had never been spoken in the House than were uttered on this occasion. But the Minister was successful. He had been supported on the Address; and he went home to East Barsetshire at Christmas, perhaps with some little fear of the parsons around him; but with a full conviction that he would at least carry the second reading of his bill.</p><p>London was more than usually full and busy this year immediately after Christmas. It seemed as though it were admitted by all the Liberal party generally that the sadness of the occasion ought to rob the season of its usual festivities. Who could eat mince pies or think of Twelfth Night while so terribly wicked a scheme was in progress for keeping the real majority out in the cold? It was the injustice of the thing that rankled so deeply,--that, and a sense of inferiority to the cleverness displayed by Mr. Daubeny! It was as when a player is checkmated by some audacious combination of two pawns and a knight, such being all the remaining forces of the victorious adversary, when the beaten man has two castles and a queen upon the board. It was, indeed, worse than this,--for the adversary had appropriated to his own use the castles and the queen of the unhappy vanquished one. This Church Reform was the legitimate property of the Liberals, and had not been as yet used by them only because they had felt it right to keep in the background for some future great occasion so great and so valuable a piece of ordnance. It was theirs so safely that they could afford to bide their time. And then,--so they all said, and so some of them believed,--the country was not ready for so great a measure. It must come; but there must be tenderness in the mode of producing it. The parsons must be respected, and the great Church-of-England feeling of the people must be considered with affectionate regard. Even the most rabid Dissenter would hardly wish to see a structure so nearly divine attacked and destroyed by rude hands. With grave and slow and sober earnestness, with loving touches and soft caressing manipulation let the beautiful old Church be laid to its rest, as something too exquisite, too lovely, too refined for the present rough manners of the world! Such were the ideas as to Church Reform of the leading Liberals of the day; and now this man, without even a majority to back him, this audacious Cagliostro among statesmen, this destructive leader of all declared Conservatives, had come forward without a moment&#39;s warning, and pretended that he would do the thing out of hand! Men knew that it had to be done. The country had begun to perceive that the old Establishment must fall; and, knowing this, would not the Liberal backbone of Great Britain perceive the enormity of this Cagliostro&#39;s wickedness,--and rise against him and bury him beneath its scorn as it ought to do? This was the feeling that made a real Christmas impossible to Messrs. Ratler and Bonteen.</p><p>&quot;The one thing incredible to me,&quot; said Mr. Ratler, &quot;is that Englishmen should be so mean.&quot; He was alluding to the Conservatives who had shown their intention of supporting Mr. Daubeny, and whom he accused of doing so, simply with a view to power and patronage, without any regard to their own consistency or to the welfare of the country. Mr. Ratler probably did not correctly read the minds of the men whom he was accusing, and did not perceive, as he should have done with his experience, how little there was among them of concerted action. To defend the Church was a duty to each of them; but then, so also was it a duty to support his party. And each one could see his way to the one duty, whereas the other was vague, and too probably ultimately impossible. If it were proper to throw off the incubus of this conjuror&#39;s authority, surely some wise, and great, and bold man would get up and so declare. Some junto of wise men of the party would settle that he should be deposed. But where were they to look for the wise and bold men? where even for the junto? Of whom did the party consist?--Of honest, chivalrous, and enthusiastic men, but mainly of men who were idle, and unable to take upon their own shoulders the responsibility of real work. Their leaders had been selected from the outside,--clever, eager, pushing men, but of late had been hardly selected from among themselves. As used to be the case with Italian Powers, they entrusted their cause to mercenary foreign generals, soldiers of fortune, who carried their good swords whither they were wanted; and, as of old, the leaders were ever ready to fight, but would themselves declare what should be and what should not be the <em>casus belli</em>. There was not so much meanness as Mr. Ratler supposed in the Conservative ranks, but very much more unhappiness. Would it not be better to go home and live at the family park all the year round, and hunt, and attend Quarter Sessions, and be able to declare morning and evening with a clear conscience that the country was going to the dogs? Such was the mental working of many a Conservative who supported Mr. Daubeny on this occasion.</p><p>At the instance of Lady Laura, Phineas called upon the Duke of St. Bungay soon after his return, and was very kindly received by his Grace. In former days, when there were Whigs instead of Liberals, it was almost a rule of political life that all leading Whigs should be uncles, brothers-in-law, or cousins to each other. This was pleasant and gave great consistency to the party; but the system has now gone out of vogue. There remain of it, however, some traces, so that among the nobler born Liberals of the day there is still a good deal of agreeable family connection. In this way the St. Bungay Fitz-Howards were related to the Mildmays and Standishes, and such a man as Barrington Erle was sure to be cousin to all of them. Lady Laura had thus only sent her friend to a relation of her own, and as the Duke and Phineas had been in the same Government, his Grace was glad enough to receive the returning aspirant. Of course there was something said at first as to the life of the Earl at Dresden. The Duke recollected the occasion of such banishment, and shook his head; and attempted to look unhappy when the wretched condition of Mr. Kennedy was reported to him. But he was essentially a happy man, and shook off the gloom at once when Phineas spoke of politics. &quot;So you are coming back to us, Mr. Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They tell me I may perhaps get the seat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am heartily glad, for you were very useful. I remember how Cantrip almost cried when he told me you were going to leave him. He had been rather put upon, I fancy, before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There was perhaps something in that, your Grace.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There will be nothing to return to now beyond barren honours.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not for a while.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not for a long while,&quot; said the Duke;--&quot;for a long while, that is, as candidates for office regard time. Mr. Daubeny will be safe for this Session at least. I doubt whether he will really attempt to carry his measure this year. He will bring it forward, and after the late division he must get his second reading. He will then break down gracefully in Committee, and declare that the importance of the interests concerned demands further inquiry. It wasn&#39;t a thing to be done in one year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why should he do it at all?&quot; asked Phineas.</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s what everybody asks, but the answer seems to be so plain! Because he can do it, and we can&#39;t. He will get from our side much support, and we should get none from his.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is something to me sickening in their dishonesty,&quot; said Phineas energetically.</p><p>&quot;The country has the advantage; and I don&#39;t know that they are dishonest. Ought we to come to a deadlock in legislation in order that parties might fight out their battle till one had killed the other?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t think a man should support a measure which he believes to be destructive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t believe it to be destructive. The belief is theoretic,--or not even quite that. It is hardly more than romantic. As long as acres are dear, and he can retain those belonging to him, the country gentleman will never really believe his country to be in danger. It is the same with commerce. As long as the Three per Cents. do not really mean Four per Cent.,--I may say as long as they don&#39;t mean Five per Cent.,--the country will be rich, though every one should swear that it be ruined.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m very glad, at the same time, that I don&#39;t call myself a Conservative,&quot; said Phineas.</p><p>&quot;That shows how disinterested you are, as you certainly would be in office. Good-bye. Come and see the Duchess when she comes to town. And if you&#39;ve nothing better to do, give us a day or two at Longroyston at Easter.&quot; Now Longroyston was the Duke&#39;s well-known country seat, at which Whig hospitality had been dispensed with a lavish hand for two centuries.</p><p>On the 20th January Phineas travelled down to Tankerville again in obedience to a summons served upon him at the instance of the judge who was to try his petition against Browborough. It was the special and somewhat unusual nature of this petition that the complainants not only sought to oust the sitting member, but also to give the seat to the late unsuccessful candidate. There was to be a scrutiny, by which, if it should be successful, so great a number of votes would be deducted from those polled on behalf of the unfortunate Mr. Browborough as to leave a majority for his opponent, with the additional disagreeable obligation upon him of paying the cost of the transaction by which he would thus lose his seat. Mr. Browborough, no doubt, looked upon the whole thing with the greatest disgust. He thought that a battle when once won should be regarded as over till the occasion should come for another battle. He had spent his money like a gentleman, and hated these mean ways. No one could ever say that he had ever petitioned. That was his way of looking at it. That Shibboleth of his as to the prospects of England and the Church of her people had, no doubt, made the House less agreeable to him during the last Short session than usual; but he had stuck to his party, and voted with Mr. Daubeny on the Address,--the obligation for such vote having inconveniently pressed itself upon him before the presentation of the petition had been formally completed. He had always stuck to his party. It was the pride of his life that he had been true and consistent. He also was summoned to Tankerville, and he was forced to go, although he knew that the Shibboleth would be thrown in his teeth.</p><p>Mr. Browborough spent two or three very uncomfortable days at Tankerville, whereas Phineas was triumphant. There were worse things in store for poor Mr. Browborough than his repudiated Shibboleth, or even than his lost seat. Mr. Ruddles, acting with wondrous energy, succeeded in knocking off the necessary votes, and succeeded also in proving that these votes were void by reason of gross bribery. He astonished Phineas by the cool effrontery with which he took credit to himself for not having purchased votes in the Fallgate on the Liberal side, but Phineas was too wise to remind him that he himself had hinted at one time that it would be well to lay out a little money in that way. No one at the present moment was more clear than was Ruddles as to the necessity of purity at elections. Not a penny had been misspent by the Finnites. A vote or two from their score was knocked off on grounds which did not touch the candidate or his agents. One man had personated a vote, but this appeared to have been done at the instigation of some very cunning Browborough partisan. Another man had been wrongly described. This, however, amounted to nothing. Phineas Finn was seated for the borough, and the judge declared his purpose of recommending the House of Commons to issue a commission with reference to the expediency of instituting a prosecution. Mr. Browborough left the town in great disgust, not without various publicly expressed intimations from his opponents that the prosperity of England depended on the Church of her people. Phineas was gloriously entertained by the Liberals of the borough, and then informed that as so much had been done for him it was hoped that he would now open his pockets on behalf of the charities of the town. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Phineas, to one or two of the leading Liberals, &quot;it is as well that you should know at once that I am a very poor man.&quot; The leading Liberals made wry faces, but Phineas was member for the borough.</p><p>The moment that the decision was announced, Phineas, shaking off for the time his congratulatory friends, hurried to the post-office and sent his message to Lady Laura Standish at Dresden: &quot;I have got the seat.&quot; He was almost ashamed of himself as the telegraph boy looked up at him when he gave in the words, but this was a task which he could not have entrusted to any one else. He almost thought that this was in truth the proudest and happiest moment of his life. She would so thoroughly enjoy his triumph, would receive from it such great and unselfish joy, that he almost wished that he could have taken the message himself. Surely had he done so there would have been fit occasion for another embrace.</p><p>He was again a member of the British House of Commons,--was again in possession of that privilege for which he had never ceased to sigh since the moment in which he lost it. A drunkard or a gambler may be weaned from his ways, but not a politician. To have been in the House and not to be there was, to such a one as Phineas Finn, necessarily a state of discontent. But now he had worked his way up again, and he was determined that no fears for the future should harass him. He would give his heart and soul to the work while his money lasted. It would surely last him for the Session. He was all alone in the world, and would trust to the chapter of accidents for the future.</p><p>&quot;I never knew a fellow with such luck as yours,&quot; said Barrington Erle to him, on his return to London. &quot;A seat always drops into your mouth when the circumstances seem to be most forlorn.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have been lucky, certainly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My cousin, Laura Kennedy, has been writing to me about you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I went over to see them, you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So I heard. She talks some nonsense about the Earl being willing to do anything for you. What could the Earl do? He has no more influence in the Loughton borough than I have. All that kind of thing is clean done for,--with one or two exceptions. We got much better men while it lasted than we do now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I should doubt that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We did;--much truer men,--men who went straighter. By the bye, Phineas, we must have no tricks on this Church matter. We mean to do all we can to throw out the second reading.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know what I said at the hustings.&quot;</p><p>&quot;D---- the hustings. I know what Browborough said, and Browborough voted like a man with his party. You were against the Church at the hustings, and he was for it. You will vote just the other way. There will be a little confusion, but the people of Tankerville will never remember the particulars.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know that I can do that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By heavens, if you don&#39;t, you shall never more be officer of ours,--though Laura Kennedy should cry her eyes out.&quot;</p><p>CHAPTER XIV.</p><p>TRUMPETON WOOD.</p><p>In the meantime the hunting season was going on in the Brake country with chequered success. There had arisen the great Trumpeton Wood question, about which the sporting world was doomed to hear so much for the next twelve months,--and Lord Chiltern was in an unhappy state of mind. Trumpeton Wood belonged to that old friend of ours, the Duke of Omnium, who had now almost fallen into second childhood. It was quite out of the question that the Duke should himself interfere in such a matter, or know anything about it; but Lord Chiltern, with headstrong resolution, had persisted in writing to the Duke himself. Foxes had always hitherto been preserved in Trumpeton Wood, and the earths had always been stopped on receipt of due notice by the keepers. During the cubbing season there had arisen quarrels. The keepers complained that no effort was made to kill the foxes. Lord Chiltern swore that the earths were not stopped. Then there came tidings of a terrible calamity. A dying fox, with a trap to its pad, was found in the outskirts of the Wood; and Lord Chiltern wrote to the Duke. He drew the Wood in regular course before any answer could be received,--and three of his hounds picked up poison, and died beneath his eyes. He wrote to the Duke again,--a cutting letter; and then came from the Duke&#39;s man of business, Mr. Fothergill, a very short reply, which Lord Chiltern regarded as an insult. Hitherto the affair had not got into the sporting papers, and was simply a matter of angry discussion at every meet in the neighbouring counties. Lord Chiltern was very full of wrath, and always looked as though he desired to avenge those poor hounds on the Duke and all belonging to him. To a Master of Hounds the poisoning of one of his pack is murder of the deepest dye. There probably never was a Master who in his heart of hearts would not think it right that a detected culprit should be hung for such an offence. And most Masters would go further than this, and declare that in the absence of such detection the owner of the covert in which the poison had been picked up should be held to be responsible. In this instance the condition of ownership was unfortunate. The Duke himself was old, feeble, and almost imbecile. He had never been eminent as a sportsman; but, in a not energetic manner, he had endeavoured to do his duty by the country. His heir, Plantagenet Palliser, was simply a statesman, who, as regarded himself, had never a day to spare for amusement; and who, in reference to sport, had unfortunate fantastic notions that pheasants and rabbits destroyed crops, and that foxes were injurious to old women&#39;s poultry. He, however, was not the owner, and had refused to interfere. There had been family quarrels too, adverse to the sporting interests of the younger Palliser scions, so that the shooting of this wood had drifted into the hands of Mr. Fothergill and his friends. Now, Lord Chiltern had settled it in his own mind that the hounds had been poisoned, if not in compliance with Mr. Fothergill&#39;s orders, at any rate in furtherance of his wishes, and, could he have had his way, he certainly would have sent Mr. Fothergill to the gallows. Now, Miss Palliser, who was still staying at Lord Chiltern&#39;s house, was niece to the old Duke, and first cousin to the heir. &quot;They are nothing to me,&quot; she said once, when Lord Chiltern had attempted to apologise for the abuse he was heaping on her relatives. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen the Duke since I was a little child, and I shouldn&#39;t know my cousin were I to meet him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So much the more gracious is your condition,&quot; said Lady Chiltern,--&quot;at any rate in Oswald&#39;s estimation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know them, and once spent a couple of days at Matching with them,&quot; said Lord Chiltern. &quot;The Duke is an old fool, who always gave himself greater airs than any other man in England,--and as far as I can see, with less to excuse them. As for Planty Pall, he and I belong so essentially to different orders of things, that we can hardly be reckoned as being both men.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And which is the man, Lord Chiltern?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whichever you please, my dear; only not both. Doggett was over there yesterday, and found three separate traps.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What did he do with the traps?&quot; said Lady Chiltern.</p><p>&quot;I wasn&#39;t fool enough to ask him, but I don&#39;t in the least doubt that he threw them into the water--or that he&#39;d throw Palliser there too if he could get hold of him. As for taking the hounds to Trumpeton again, I wouldn&#39;t do it if there were not another covert in the country.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then leave it so, and have done with it,&quot; said his wife. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t fret as you do for what another man did with his own property, for all the foxes in England.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is because you understand nothing of hunting, my dear. A man&#39;s property is his own in one sense, but isn&#39;t his own in another. A man can&#39;t do what he likes with his coverts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He can cut them down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But he can&#39;t let another pack hunt them, and he can&#39;t hunt them himself. If he&#39;s in a hunting county he is bound to preserve foxes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What binds him, Oswald? A man can&#39;t be bound without a penalty.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I should think it penalty enough for everybody to hate me. What are you going to do about Phineas Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have asked him to come on the 1st and stay till Parliament meets.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And is that woman coming?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are two or three women coming.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She with the German name, whom you made me dine with in Park Lane?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Madame Max Goesler is coming. She brings her own horses, and they will stand at Doggett&#39;s.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They can&#39;t stand here, for there is not a stall.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am so sorry that my poor little fellow should incommode you,&quot; said Miss Palliser.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re a licensed offender,--though, upon my honour, I don&#39;t know whether I ought to give a feed of oats to any one having a connection with Trumpeton Wood. And what is Phineas to ride?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He shall ride my horses,&quot; said Lady Chiltern, whose present condition in life rendered hunting inopportune to her.</p><p>&quot;Neither of them would carry him a mile. He wants about as good an animal as you can put him upon. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m to do. It&#39;s all very well for Laura to say that he must be mounted.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You wouldn&#39;t refuse to give Mr. Finn a mount!&quot; said Lady Chiltern, almost with dismay.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d give him my right hand to ride, only it wouldn&#39;t carry him. I can&#39;t make horses. Harry brought home that brown mare on Tuesday with an overreach that she won&#39;t get over this season. What the deuce they do with their horses to knock them about so, I can&#39;t understand. I&#39;ve killed horses in my time, and ridden them to a stand-still, but I never bruised them and battered them about as these fellows do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then I&#39;d better write to Mr. Finn, and tell him,&quot; said Lady Chiltern, very gravely.</p><p>&quot;Oh, Phineas Finn!&quot; said Lord Chiltern; &quot;oh, Phineas Finn! what a pity it was that you and I didn&#39;t see the matter out when we stood opposite to each other on the sands at Blankenberg!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oswald,&quot; said his wife, getting up, and putting her arm over his shoulder, &quot;you know you would give your best horse to Mr. Finn, as long as he chose to stay here, though you rode upon a donkey yourself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that if I didn&#39;t, you would,&quot; said Lord Chiltern. And so the matter was settled.</p><p>At night, when they were alone together, there was further discussion as to the visitors who were coming to Harrington Hall. &quot;Is Gerard Maule to come back?&quot; asked the husband.</p><p>&quot;I have asked him. He left his horses at Doggett&#39;s, you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I certainly told you, Oswald. Do you object to his coming? You can&#39;t really mean that you care about his riding?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It isn&#39;t that. You must have some whipping post, and he&#39;s as good as another. But he shilly-shallies about that girl. I hate all that stuff like poison.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All men are not so--abrupt shall I say?--as you were.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I had something to say, and I said it. When I had said it a dozen times, I got to have it believed. He doesn&#39;t say it as though he meant to have it believed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You were always in earnest, Oswald.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To the extent of the three minutes which you allowed yourself. It sufficed, however;--did it not? You are glad you persevered?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What fools women are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never mind that. Say you are glad. I like you to tell me so. Let me be a fool if I will.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What made you so obstinate?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. I never could tell. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t dote upon you, and think about you, and feel quite sure that there never could be any other one than you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve no doubt it was all right;--only you very nearly made me shoot a fellow, and now I&#39;ve got to find horses for him. I wonder whether he could ride Dandolo?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t put him up on anything very hard.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why not? His wife is dead, and he hasn&#39;t got a child, nor yet an acre of property. I don&#39;t know who is entitled to break his neck if he is not. And Dandolo is as good a horse as there is in the stable, if you can once get him to go. Mind, I have to start to-morrow at nine, for it&#39;s all eighteen miles.&quot; And so the Master of the Brake Hounds took himself to his repose.</p><p>Lady Laura Kennedy had written to Barrington Erle respecting her friend&#39;s political interests, and to her sister-in-law, Lady Chiltern, as to his social comfort. She could not bear to think that he should be left alone in London till Parliament should meet, and had therefore appealed to Lady Chiltern as to the memory of many past events. The appeal had been unnecessary and superfluous. It cannot be said that Phineas and his affairs were matters of as close an interest to Lady Chiltern as to Lady Laura. If any woman loved her husband beyond all things Lord Chiltern&#39;s wife did, and ever had done so. But there had been a tenderness in regard to the young Irish Member of Parliament, which Violet Effingham had in old days shared with Lady Laura, and which made her now think that all good things should be done for him. She believed him to be addicted to hunting, and therefore horses must be provided for him. He was a widower, and she remembered of old that he was fond of pretty women, and she knew that in coming days he might probably want money;--and therefore she had asked Madame Max Goesler to spend a fortnight at Harrington Hall. Madame Max Goesler and Phineas Finn had been acquainted before, as Lady Chiltern was well aware. But perhaps Lady Chiltern, when she summoned Madame Max into the country, did not know how close the acquaintance had been.</p><p>Madame Max came a couple of days before Phineas, and was taken out hunting on the morning after her arrival. She was a lady who could ride to hounds,--and who, indeed, could do nearly anything to which she set her mind. She was dark, thin, healthy, good-looking, clever, ambitious, rich, unsatisfied, perhaps unscrupulous,--but not without a conscience. As has been told in a former portion of this chronicle, she could always seem to be happy with her companion of the day, and yet there was ever present a gnawing desire to do something more and something better than she had as yet achieved. Of course, as he took her to the meet, Lord Chiltern told her his grievance respecting Trumpeton Wood. &quot;But, my dear Lord Chiltern, you must not abuse the Duke of Omnium to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why not to you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He and I are sworn friends.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s a hundred years old.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And why shouldn&#39;t I have a friend a hundred years old? And as for Mr. Palliser, he knows no more of your foxes than I know of his taxes. Why don&#39;t you write to Lady Glencora? She understands everything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is she a friend of yours, too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My particular friend. She and I, you know, look after the poor dear Duke between us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can understand why she should sacrifice herself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But not why I do. I can&#39;t explain it myself; but so it has come to pass, and I must not hear the Duke abused. May I write to Lady Glencora about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Certainly,--if you please; but not as giving her any message from me. Her uncle&#39;s property is mismanaged most damnably. If you choose to tell her that I say so you can. I&#39;m not going to ask anything as a favour. I never do ask favours. But the Duke or Planty Palliser among them should do one of two things. They should either stand by the hunting, or they should let it alone;--and they should say what they mean. I like to know my friends, and I like to know my enemies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am sure the Duke is not your enemy, Lord Chiltern.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These Pallisers have always been running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. They are great aristocrats, and yet are always going in for the people. I&#39;m told that Planty Pall calls fox-hunting barbarous. Why doesn&#39;t he say so out loud, and stub up Trumpeton Wood and grow corn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps he will when Trumpeton Wood belongs to him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I should like that much better than poisoning hounds and trapping foxes.&quot; When they got to the meet, conclaves of men might be seen gathered together here and there, and in each conclave they were telling something new or something old as to the iniquities perpetrated at Trumpeton Wood.</p><p>On that evening before dinner Madame Goesler was told by her hostess that Phineas Finn was expected on the following day. The communication was made quite as a matter of course; but Lady Chiltern had chosen a time in which the lights were shaded, and the room was dark. Adelaide Palliser was present, as was also a certain Lady Baldock,--not that Lady Baldock who had abused all Papists to poor Phineas, but her son&#39;s wife. They were drinking tea together over the fire, and the dim lights were removed from the circle. This, no doubt, was simply an accident; but the gloom served Madame Goesler during one moment of embarrassment. &quot;An old friend of yours is coming here to-morrow,&quot; said Lady Chiltern.</p><p>&quot;An old friend of mine! Shall I call my friend he or she?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You remember Mr. Finn?&quot;</p><p>That was the moment in which Madame Goesler rejoiced that no strong glare of light fell upon her face. But she was a woman who would not long leave herself subject to any such embarrassment. &quot;Surely,&quot; she said, confining herself at first to the single word.</p><p>&quot;He is coming here. He is a great friend of mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He always was a good friend of yours, Lady Chiltern.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And of yours, too, Madame Max. A sort of general friend, I think, was Mr. Finn in the old days. I hope you will be glad to see him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, dear, yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought him very nice,&quot; said Adelaide Palliser.</p><p>&quot;I remember mamma saying, before she was mamma, you know,&quot; said Lady Baldock, &quot;that Mr. Finn was very nice indeed, only he was a Papist, and only he had got no money, and only he would fall in love with everybody. Does he go on falling in love with people, Violet?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never with married women, my dear. He has had a wife himself since that, Madame Goesler, and the poor thing died.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And now here he is beginning all over again,&quot; said Lady Baldock.</p><p>&quot;And as pleasant as ever,&quot; said her cousin. &quot;You know he has done all manner of things for our family. He picked Oswald up once after one of those terrible hunting accidents; and he saved Mr. Kennedy when men were murdering him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That was questionable kindness,&quot; said Lady Baldock.</p><p>&quot;And he sat for Lord Brentford&#39;s borough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How good of him!&quot; said Miss Palliser.</p><p>&quot;And he has done all manner of things,&quot; said Lady Chiltern.</p><p>&quot;Didn&#39;t he once fight a duel?&quot; asked Madame Goesler.</p><p>&quot;That was the grandest thing of all,&quot; said his friend, &quot;for he didn&#39;t shoot somebody whom perhaps he might have shot had he been as bloodthirsty as somebody else. And now he has come back to Parliament, and all that kind of thing, and he&#39;s coming here to hunt. I hope you&#39;ll be glad to see him, Madame Goesler.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall be very glad to see him,&quot; said Madame Goesler, slowly; &quot;I heard about his success at that town, and I knew that I should meet him somewhere.&quot;</p><p>CHAPTER XV.</p><p>&quot;HOW WELL YOU KNEW!&quot;</p><p>It was necessary also that some communication should be made to Phineas, so that he might not come across Madame Goesler unawares. Lady Chiltern was more alive to that necessity than she had been to the other, and felt that the gentleman, if not warned of what was to take place, would be much more likely than the lady to be awkward at the trying moment. Madame Goesler would in any circumstances be sure to recover her self-possession very quickly, even were she to lose it for a moment; but so much could hardly be said for the social powers of Phineas Finn. Lady Chiltern therefore contrived to see him alone for a moment on his arrival. &quot;Who do you think is here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lady Laura has not come!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Indeed, no; I wish she had. An old friend, but not so old as Laura!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I cannot guess;--not Lord Fawn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lord Fawn! What would Lord Fawn do here? Don&#39;t you know that Lord Fawn goes nowhere since his last matrimonial trouble? It&#39;s a friend of yours, not of mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Madame Goesler?&quot; whispered Phineas.</p><p>&quot;How well you knew when I said it was a friend of yours. Madame Goesler is here,--not altered in the least.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Madame Goesler!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Does it annoy you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, no. Why should it annoy me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You never quarrelled with her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never!&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is no reason why you should not meet her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;None at all;--only I was surprised. Did she know that I was coming?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I told her yesterday. I hope that I have not done wrong or made things unpleasant. I knew that you used to be friends.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And as friends we parted, Lady Chiltern.&quot; He had nothing more to say in th</p>`,799)]))}const p=t(h,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
