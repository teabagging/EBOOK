All the cheese-fanciers are out, thumping the cannon-ball Edams and the millstone Goudas with their bare red knuckles, plugging in with a hollow steel tool for samples. In Holland the business of judging a crumb of cheese has been taken with great seriousness for centuries. The abracadabra is comparable to that of the wine-taster or tea-taster. These Edamers have the trained ear of music-masters and, merely by knuckle-rapping, can tell down to an air pocket left by a gas bubble just how mature the interior is.</p><p>The connoisseurs use gingerbread as a mouth-freshener; and I, too, that sunny day among the Edams, kept my gingerbread handy and made my way from one fine cheese to another, trying out generous plugs from the heaped cannon balls that looked like the ammunition dump at Antietam.</p><p>I remember another market day, this time in Lucerne. All morning I stocked up on good Schweizerkaese and better Gruyere. For lunch I had cheese salad. All around me the farmers were rolling two-hundred-pound Emmentalers, bigger than oxcart wheels. I sat in a little cafe, absorbing cheese and cheese lore in equal quantities. I learned that a prize cheese must be chock-full of equal-sized eyes, the gas holes produced during fermentation. They must glisten like polished bar glass. The cheese itself must be of a light, lemonish yellow. Its flavor must be nutlike. (Nuts and Swiss cheese complement each other as subtly as Gorgonzola and a ripe banana.) There are, I learned, &quot;blind&quot; Swiss cheeses as well, but the million-eyed ones are better.</p><p>But I don&#39;t have to hark back to Switzerland and Holland for cheese memories. Here at home we have increasingly taken over the cheeses of all nations, first importing them, then imitating them, from Swiss Engadine to what we call Genuine Sprinz. We&#39;ve naturalized Scandinavian Blues and smoked browns and baptized our own Saaland Pfarr in native whiskey. Of fifty popular Italian types we duplicate more than half, some fairly well, others badly.</p><p>We have our own legitimate offspring too, beginning with the Pineapple, supposed to have been first made about 1845 in Litchfield County, Connecticut. We have our own creamy Neufchatel, New York Coon, Vermont Sage, the delicious Liederkranz, California Jack, Nuworld, and dozens of others, not all quite so original.</p><p>And, true to the American way, we&#39;ve organized cheese-eating. There&#39;s an annual cheese week, and a cheese month (October). We even boast a mail-order Cheese-of-the-Month Club. We haven&#39;t yet reached the point of sophistication, however, attained by a Paris cheese club that meets regularly. To qualify for membership you have to identify two hundred basic cheeses, and you have to do it blindfolded.</p><p>This is a test I&#39;d prefer not to submit to, but in my amateur way I have during the past year or two been sharpening my cheese perception with whatever varieties I could encounter around New York. I&#39;ve run into briny Caucasian Cossack, Corsican Gricotta, and exotics like Rarush Durmar, Travnik, and Karaghi La-la. Cheese-hunting is one of the greatest--and least competitively crowded--of sports. I hope this book may lead others to give it a try.</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p><em>Chapter Two</em></p><p>The Big Cheese</p><p>One of the world&#39;s first outsize cheeses officially weighed in at four tons in a fair at Toronto, Canada, seventy years ago. Another monstrous Cheddar tipped the scales at six tons in the New York State Fair at Syracuse in 1937.</p><p>Before this, a one-thousand-pounder was fetched all the way from New Zealand to London to star in the Wembley Exposition of 1924. But, compared to the outsize Syracusan, it looked like a Baby Gouda. As a matter of fact, neither England nor any of her great dairying colonies have gone in for mammoth jobs, except Canada, with that four-tonner shown at Toronto.</p><p>We should mention two historic king-size Chesters. You can find out all about them in <em>Cheddar Gorge,</em> edited by Sir John Squire. The first of them weighed 149 pounds, and was the largest made, up to the year 1825. It was proudly presented to H.R.H. the Duke of York. (Its heft almost tied the 147-pound Green County wheel of Wisconsin Swiss presented by the makers to President Coolidge in 1928 in appreciation of his raising the protective tariff against genuine Swiss to 50 percent.) While the cheese itself weighed a mite under 150, His Royal Highness, ruff, belly, knee breeches, doffed high hat and all, was a hundred-weight heavier, and thus almost dwarfed it.</p><p>It was almost a century later that the second record-breaking Chester weighed in, at only 200 pounds. Yet it won a Gold Medal and a Challenge Cup and was presented to the King, who graciously accepted it. This was more than Queen Victoria had done with a bridal gift cheese that tipped the scales at 1,100 pounds. It took a whole day&#39;s yield from 780 contented cows, and stood a foot and eight inches high, measuring nine feet, four inches around the middle. The assembled donors of the cheese were so proud of it that they asked royal permission to exhibit it on a round of country fairs. The Queen assented to this ambitious request, perhaps prompted by the exhibition-minded Albert. The publicity-seeking cheesemongers assured Her Majesty that the gift would be returned to her just as soon as it had been exhibited. But the Queen didn&#39;t want it back after it was show-worn. The donors began to quarrel among themselves about what to do with the remains, until finally it got into Chancery where so many lost causes end their days. The cheese was never heard of again.</p><p>While it is generally true that the bigger the cheese the better, (much the same as a magnum bottle of champagne is better than a pint), there is a limit to the obesity of a block, ball or brick of almost any kinds of cheese. When they pass a certain limit, they lack homogeneity and are not nearly so good as the smaller ones. Today a good magnum size for an exhibition Cheddar is 560 pounds; for a prize Provolone, 280 pounds; while a Swiss wheel of only 210 will draw crowds to any food-shop window.</p><p>Yet by and large it&#39;s the monsters that get into the Cheese Hall of Fame and come down to us in song and story. For example, that four-ton Toronto affair inspired a cheese poet, James McIntyre, who doubled as the local undertaker.</p><pre><code>We have thee, mammoth cheese,
Lying quietly at your ease;
Gently fanned by evening breeze,
Thy fair form no flies dare seize.

All gaily dressed soon you&#39;ll go
To the greatest provincial show,
To be admired by many a beau
In the city of Toronto.

May you not receive a scar as
We have heard that Mr. Harris
Intends to send you off as far as
The great world&#39;s show at Paris.

Of the youth beware of these,
For some of them might rudely squeeze
And bite your cheek; then song or glees
We could not sing, oh, Queen of Cheese.
</code></pre><p>An ode to a one hundred percent American mammoth was inspired by &quot;The Ultra-Democratic, Anti-Federalist Cheese of Cheshire.&quot; This was in the summer of 1801 when the patriotic people of Cheshire, Massachusetts, turned out en masse to concoct a mammoth cheese on the village green for presentation to their beloved President Jefferson. The unique demonstration occurred spontaneously in jubilant commemoration of the greatest political triumph of a new country in a new century--the victory of the Democrats over the Federalists. Its collective making was heralded in Boston&#39;s <em>Mercury and New England Palladium</em>, September 8, 1801:</p><pre><code>_The Mammoth Cheese_

AN EPICO-LYRICO BALLAD

From meadows rich, with clover red,
  A thousand heifers come;
The tinkling bells the tidings spread,
The milkmaid muffles up her head,
  And wakes the village hum.

In shining pans the snowy flood
  Through whitened canvas pours;
The dyeing pots of otter good
And rennet tinged with madder blood
  Are sought among their stores.

The quivering curd, in panniers stowed,
  Is loaded on the jade,
The stumbling beast supports the load,
While trickling whey bedews the road
  Along the dusty glade.

As Cairo&#39;s slaves, to bondage bred,
  The arid deserts roam,
Through trackless sands undaunted tread,
With skins of water on their head
  To cheer their masters home,

So here full many a sturdy swain
  His precious baggage bore;
Old misers e&#39;en forgot their gain,
And bed-rid cripples, free from pain,
  Now took the road before.

The widow, with her dripping mite
  Upon her saddle horn,
Rode up in haste to see the sight
And aid a charity so right,
  A pauper so forlorn.

The circling throng an opening drew
  Upon the verdant-grass
To let the vast procession through
To spread their rich repast in view,
  And Elder J. L. pass.

Then Elder J. with lifted eyes
  In musing posture stood,
Invoked a blessing from the skies
To save from vermin, mites and flies,
  And keep the bounty good.

Now mellow strokes the yielding pile
  From polished steel receives,
And shining nymphs stand still a while,
Or mix the mass with salt and oil,
  With sage and savory leaves.

Then sextonlike, the patriot troop,
  With naked arms and crown,
Embraced, with hardy hands, the scoop,
And filled the vast expanded hoop,
  While beetles smacked it down.

Next girding screws the ponderous beam,
  With heft immense, drew down;
The gushing whey from every seam
Flowed through the streets a rapid stream,
  And shad came up to town.

When Van Buren succeeded to the Presidency, he received a similar mammoth cheese in token of the high esteem in which he was held. A monstrous one, bigger than the Jeffersonian, was made by New Englanders to show their loyalty to President Jackson. For weeks this stood in state in the hall of the White House. At last the floor was a foot deep in the fragments remaining after the enthusiastic Democrats had eaten their fill.</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p><em>Chapter Three</em></p><p>Foreign Greats</p><pre><code>    _Ode to Cheese_


God of the country, bless today Thy cheese,
For which we give Thee thanks on bended knees.
Let them be fat or light, with onions blent,
Shallots, brine, pepper, honey; whether scent
Of sheep or fields is in them, in the yard
Let them, good Lord, at dawn be beaten hard.
And let their edges take on silvery shades
Under the moist red hands of dairymaids;
And, round and greenish, let them go to town
Weighing the shepherd&#39;s folding mantle down;
Whether from Parma or from Jura heights,
Kneaded by august hands of Carmelites,
Stamped with the mitre of a proud abbess.
Flowered with the perfumes of the grass of Bresse,
From hollow Holland, from the Vosges, from Brie,
From Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Italy!
Bless them, good Lord! Bless Stilton&#39;s royal fare,
Red Cheshire, and the tearful cream Gruyere.

FROM JETHRO BITHELL&#39;S TRANSLATION
OF A POEM BY M. Thomas Braun

 _Symphonie des Fromages_

 A giant Cantal, seeming to have been chopped open with an ax,
 stood aside of a golden-hued Chester and a Swiss Gruyere
 resembling the wheel of a Roman chariot There were Dutch Edams,
 round and blood-red, and Port-Saluts lined up like soldiers on
 parade. Three Bries, side by side, suggested phases of the moon;
 two of them, very dry, were amber-colored and &quot;full,&quot; and the
 third, in its second quarter, was runny and creamy, with a &quot;milky
 way&quot; which no human barrier seemed able to restrain. And all the
 while majestic Roqueforts looked down with princely contempt upon
 the other, through the glass of their crystal covers.

 Emile Zola
</code></pre><p>In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture published Handbook No. 54, entitled <em>Cheese Varieties and Descriptions,</em> with this comment: &quot;There probably are only about eighteen distinct types or kinds of natural cheese.&quot; All the rest (more than 400 names) are of local origin, usually named after towns or communities. A list of the best-known names applied to each of these distinct varieties or groups is given:</p><pre><code>    Brick        Gouda         Romano
    Camembert    Hand          Roquefort
    Cheddar      Limburger     Sapsago
    Cottage      Neufchatel    Swiss
    Cream        Parmesan      Trappist
    Edam         Provolone     Whey cheeses (Mysost and Ricotta)
</code></pre><p>May we nominate another dozen to form our own Cheese Hall of Fame? We begin our list with a partial roll call of the big Blues family and end it with members of the monastic order of Port-Salut Trappist that includes Canadian Oka and our own Kentucky thoroughbred.</p><p>The Blues that Are Green</p><p>Stilton, Roquefort and Gorgonzola form the triumvirate that rules a world of lesser Blues. They are actually green, as green as the mythical cheese the moon is made of.</p><p>In almost every, land where cheese is made you can sample a handful of lesser Blues and imitations of the invincible three and try to classify them, until you&#39;re blue in the face. The best we can do in this slight summary is to mention a few of the most notable, aside from our own Blues of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon and other states that major in cheese.</p><p>Danish Blues are popular and splendidly made, such as &quot;Flower of Denmark.&quot; The Argentine competes with a pampas-grass Blue all its own. But France and England are the leaders in this line, France first with a sort of triple triumvirate within a triumvirate--Septmoncel, Gex, and Sassenage, all three made with three milks mixed together: cow, goat and sheep. Septmoncel is the leader of these, made in the Jura mountains and considered by many French caseophiles to outrank Roquefort.</p><p>This class of Blue or marbled cheese is called fromage persille, as well as fromage bleu and pate bleue. Similar mountain cheeses are made in Auvergne and Aubrac and have distinct qualities that have brought them fame, such as Cantal, bleu d&#39;Auvergne Guiole or Laguiole, bleu de Salers, and St. Flour. Olivet and Queville come within the color scheme, and sundry others such as Champoleon, Journiac, Queyras and Sarraz.</p><p>Of English Blues there are several celebrities beside Stilton and Cheshire Stilton. Wensleydale was one in the early days, and still is, together with Blue Dorset, the deepest green of them all, and esoteric Blue Vinny, a choosey cheese not liked by everybody, the favorite of Thomas Hardy.</p><p>Brie</p><p>Sheila Hibben once wrote in <em>The New Yorker:</em></p><p>I can&#39;t imagine any difference of opinion about Brie&#39;s being the queen of all cheeses, and if there is any such difference, I shall certainly ignore it. The very shape of Brie--so uncheese-like and so charmingly fragile--is exciting. Nine times out of ten a Brie will let you down--will be all caked into layers, which shows it is too young, or at the over-runny stage, which means it is too old--but when you come on the tenth Brie, <em>coulant</em> to just the right, delicate creaminess, and the color of fresh, sweet butter, no other cheese can compare with it.</p><p>The season of Brie, like that of oysters, is simple to remember: only months with an &quot;R,&quot; beginning with September, which is the best, bar none.</p><p>Caciocavallo</p><p>From Bulgaria to Turkey the Italian &quot;horse cheese,&quot; as Caciocavallo translates, is as universally popular as it is at home and in all the Little Italics throughout the rest of the world. Flattering imitations are made and named after it, as follows:</p><pre><code>BULGARIA:       Kascaval

GREECE:         Kashcavallo and Caskcaval

HUNGARY:        Parenica

RUMANIA:        Pentele and Kascaval

SERBIA:         Katschkawalj

SYRIA:          Cashkavallo

TRANSYLVANIA:   Kascaval (as in Rumania)

TURKEY:         Cascaval Penir

YUGOSLAVIA:     Kackavalj
</code></pre><p>A horse&#39;s head printed on the cheese gave rise to its popular name and to the myth that it is made of mare&#39;s milk. It is, however, curded from cow&#39;s milk, whole or partly skimmed, and sometimes from water buffalo; hard, yellow and so buttery that the best of it, which comes from Sorrento, is called <em>Cacio burro,</em> butter cheese. Slightly salty, with a spicy tang, it is eaten sliced when young and mild and used for grating and seasoning when old, not only on the usual Italian pastes but on sweets.</p><p>Different from the many grating cheeses made from little balls of curd called <em>grana</em>, Caciocavallo is a <em>pasta fileta</em>, or drawn-curd product. Because of this it is sometimes drawn out in long thick threads and braided. It is a cheese for skilled artists to make sculptures with, sometimes horses&#39; heads, again bunches of grapes and other fruits, even as Provolone is shaped like apples and pears and often worked into elaborate bas-relief designs. But ordinarily the horse&#39;s head is a plain tenpin in shape or a squat bottle with a knob on the side by which it has been tied up, two cheeses at a time, on opposite sides of a rafter, while being smoked lightly golden and rubbed with olive oil and butter to make it all the more buttery.</p><p>In Calabria and Sicily it is very popular, and although the best comes from Sorrento, there is keen competition from Abruzzi, Apulian Province and Molise. It keeps well and doesn&#39;t spoil when shipped overseas.</p><p>In his <em>Little Book of Cheese</em> Osbert Burdett recommends the high, horsy strength of this smoked Cacio over tobacco smoke after dinner:</p><pre><code> Only monsters smoke at meals, but a monster assured me that
 Gorgonzola best survives this malpractice. Clearly, some pungency
 is necessary, and confidence suggests rather Cacio which would
 survive anything, the monster said.
</code></pre><p>Camembert</p><p>Camembert is called &quot;mold-matured&quot; and all that is genuine is labeled <em>Syndicat du Vrai Camembert</em>. The name in full is <em>Syndicat des Fabricants du Veritable Camembert de Normandie</em> and we agree that this is &quot;a most useful association for the defense of one of the best cheeses of France.&quot; Its extremely delicate piquance cannot be matched, except perhaps by Brie.</p><p>Napoleon is said to have named it and to have kissed the waitress who first served it to him in the tiny town of Camembert. And there a statue stands today in the market place to honor Marie Harel who made the first Camembert.</p><p>Camembert is equally good on thin slices of apple, pineapple, pear, French &quot;flute&quot; or pumpernickel. As-with Brie and with oysters, Camembert should be eaten only in the &quot;R&quot; months, and of these September is the best.</p><p>Since Camembert rhymes with beware, if you can&#39;t get the <em>veritable</em> don&#39;t fall for a domestic imitation or any West German abomination such as one dressed like a valentine in a heart-shaped box and labeled &quot;Camembert--Cheese Exquisite.&quot; They are equally tasteless, chalky with youth, or choking with ammoniacal gas when old and decrepit.</p><p>Cheddar</p><p>The English <em>Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery</em> says:</p><pre><code> Cheddar cheese is one of the kings of cheese; it is pale coloured,
 mellow, salvy, and, when good, resembling a hazelnut in flavour.
 The Cheddar principle pervades the whole cheesemaking districts
 of America, Canada and New Zealand, but no cheese imported into
 England can equal the Cheddars of Somerset and the West of
 Scotland.
</code></pre><p>Named for a village near Bristol where farmer Joseph Harding first manufactured it, the best is still called Farmhouse Cheddar, but in America we have practically none of this. Farmhouse Cheddar must be ripened at least nine months to a mellowness, and little of our American cheese gets as much as that. Back in 1695 John Houghton wrote that it &quot;contended in goodness (if kept from two to five years, according to magnitude) with any cheese in England.&quot;</p><p>Today it is called &quot;England&#39;s second-best cheese,&quot; second after Stilton, of course.</p><p>In early days a large cheese sufficed for a year or two of family feeding, according to this old note: &quot;A big Cheddar can be kept for two years in excellent condition if kept in a cool room and turned over every other day.&quot;</p><p>But in old England some were harder to preserve: &quot;In Bath... I asked one lady of the larder how she kept Cheddar cheese. Her eyes twinkled: &#39;We don&#39;t keep cheese; we eats it.&#39;&quot;</p><p>Cheshire</p><p>A Cheshireman sailed into Spain To trade for merchandise; When he arrived from the main A Spaniard him espies. Who said, &quot;You English rogue, look here! What fruits and spices fine Our land produces twice a year.

Your fruits are ripe but twice a year, As you yourself do say, But such as I present you here Our land brings twice a day.&quot;</p><p>Anonymous</p><pre><code> Let us pass on to cheese. We have some glorious cheeses, and far
 too few people glorying in them. The Cheddar of the inn, of the
 chophouse, of the average English home, is a libel on a thing
 which, when authentic, is worthy of great honor. Cheshire,
 divinely commanded into existence as to three parts to precede
 and as to one part to accompany certain Tawny Ports and some
 Late-Bottled Ports, can be a thing for which the British Navy
 ought to fire a salute on the principle on which Colonel Brisson

</code></pre><p>Cheshire is not only the most literary cheese in England, but the oldest. It was already manufactured when Caesar conquered Britain, and tradition is that the Romans built the walled city of Chester to control the district where the precious cheese was made. Chester on the River Dee was a stronghold against the Roman invasion.</p><p>It came to fame with The Old Cheshire Cheese in Elizabethan times and waxed great with Samuel Johnson presiding at the Fleet Street Inn where White Cheshire was served &quot;with radishes or watercress or celery when in season,&quot; and Red Cheshire was served toasted or stewed in a sort of Welsh Rabbit. (<em>See</em> Chapter 5.)</p><p>The Blue variety is called Cheshire-Stilton, and Vyvyan Holland, in <em>Cheddar Gorge</em> suggests that &quot;it was no doubt a cheese of this sort, discovered and filched from the larder of the Queen of Hearts, that accounted for the contented grin on the face of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland.&quot;</p><p>All very English, as recorded in Victor Meusy&#39;s couplet:</p><pre><code>_Dans le Chester sec et rose
A longues dents, l&#39;Anglais mord._

In the Chester dry and pink
The long teeth of the English sink.
</code></pre><p>Edam and Gouda <em>Edam in Peace and War</em></p><p>There also coming into the river two Dutchmen, we sent a couple of men on board and brought three Holland cheeses, cost 4d. a piece, excellent cheeses.</p><p>Pepys&#39; <em>Diary</em>, March 2,1663</p><pre><code> Commodore Coe, of the Montevidian Navy, defeated Admiral Brown of
 the Buenos Ayrean Navy, in a naval battle, when he used Holland
 cheese for cannon balls.

 _The Harbinger_ (Vermont), December 11, 1847
</code></pre><p>The crimson cannon balls of Holland have been heard around the world. Known as &quot;red balls&quot; in England and <em>katzenkopf,</em> &quot;cat&#39;s head,&quot; in Germany, they differ from Gouda chiefly in the shape, Gouda being round but flattish and now chiefly imported as one-pound Baby Goudas.</p><p>Edam when it is good is very, very good, but when it is bad it is horrid. Sophisticated ones are sent over already scalloped for the ultimate consumer to add port, and there are crocks of Holland cheese potted with sauterne. Both Edam and Gouda should be well aged to develop full-bodied quality, two years being the accepted standard for Edam.</p><p>The best Edams result from a perfect combination of Breed (black-and-white Dutch Friesian) and Feed (the rich pasturage of Friesland and Noord Holland).</p><p>The Goudas, shaped like English Derby and Belgian Delft and Leyden, come from South Holland. Some are specially made for the Jewish trade and called Kosher Gouda. Both Edam and Gouda are eaten at mealtimes thrice daily in Holland. A Dutch breakfast without one or the other on black bread with butter and black coffee would be unthinkable. They&#39;re also boon companions to plum bread and Dutch cocoa.</p><p>&quot;Eclair Edams&quot; are those with soft insides.</p><p>Emmentaler, Gruyere and Swiss</p><pre><code>When the working woman
Takes her midday lunch,
It is a piece of Gruyere
Which for her takes the place of roast.
</code></pre><p>Victor Meusy</p><p>Whether an Emmentaler is eminently Schweizerkaese, grand Gruyere from France, or lesser Swiss of the United States, the shape, size and glisten of the eyes indicate the stage of ripeness, skill of making and quality of flavor. They must be uniform, roundish, about the size of a big cherry and, most important of all, must glisten like the eye of a lass in love, dry but with the suggestion of a tear.</p><p>Gruyere does not see eye to eye with the big-holed Swiss Saanen cartwheel or American imitation. It has tiny holes, and many of them; let us say it is freckled with pinholes, rather than pock-marked. This variety is technically called a <em>niszler</em>, while one without any holes at all is &quot;blind.&quot; Eyes or holes are also called vesicles.</p><p>Gruyere Trauben (Grape Gruyere) is aged in Neuchatel wine in Switzerland, although most Gruyere has been made in France since its introduction there in 1722. The most famous is made in the Jura, and another is called Comte from its origin in Franche-Comte.</p><p>A blind Emmentaler was made in Switzerland for export to Italy where it was hardened in caves to become a grating cheese called Raper, and now it is largely imitated there. Emmentaler, in fact, because of its piquant pecan-nut flavor and inimitable quality, is simulated everywhere, even in Switzerland.</p><p>Besides phonies from Argentina and countries as far off as Finland, we get a flood of imported and domestic Swisses of all sad sorts, with all possible faults--from too many holes, that make a flabby, wobbly cheese, to too few--cracked, dried-up, collapsed or utterly ruined by molding inside. So it will pay you to buy only the kind already marked genuine in Switzerland. For there cheese such as Saanen takes six years to ripen, improves with age, and keeps forever.</p><p>Cartwheels well over a hundred years old are still kept in cheese cellars (as common in Switzerland as wine cellars are in France), and it is said that the rank of a family is determined by the age and quality of the cheese in its larder.</p><p>Feta and Casere</p><p>The Greeks have a name for it--Feta. Their neighbors call it Greek cheese. Feta is to cheese what Hymettus is to honey. The two together make ambrosial manna. Feta is soft and as blinding white as a plate of fresh Ricotta smothered with sour cream. The whiteness is preserved by shipping the cheese all the way from Greece in kegs sloshing full of milk, the milk being renewed from time to time. Having been cured in brine, this great sheep-milk curd is slightly salty and somewhat sharp, but superbly spicy.</p><p>When first we tasted it fresh from the keg with salty milk dripping through our fingers, we gave it full marks. This was at the Staikos Brothers Greek-import store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan. We then compared Feta with thin wisps of its grown-up brother, Casere. This gray and greasy, hard and brittle palate-tickler of sheep&#39;s milk made us bleat for more Feta.</p><p>Gorgonzola</p><p>Gorgonzola, least pretentious of the Blues triumvirate (including Roquefort and Stilton) is nonetheless by common consent monarch of all other Blues from Argentina to Denmark. In England, indeed, many epicures consider Gorgonzola greater than Stilton, which is the highest praise any cheese can get there. Like all great cheeses it has been widely imitated, but never equaled. Imported Gorgonzola, when fruity ripe, is still firm but creamy and golden inside with rich green veins running through. Very pungent and highly flavored, it is eaten sliced or crumbled to flavor salad dressings, like Roquefort.</p><p>Hable Creme Chantilly</p><p>The name Hable Creme Chantilly sounds French, but the cheese is Swedish and actually lives up to the blurb in the imported package: &quot;The overall characteristic is indescribable and delightful freshness.&quot;</p><p>This exclusive product of the Walk Gaerd Creamery was hailed by Sheila Hibben in <em>The New Yorker</em> of May 6, 1950, as enthusiastically as Brillat-Savarin would have greeted a new dish, or the Planetarium a new star:</p><pre><code> Endeavoring to be as restrained as I can, I shall merely suggest
 that the arrival of Creme Chantilly is a historic event and that
 in reporting on it I feel something of the responsibility that
 the contemporaries of Madame Harel, the famous cheese-making lady
 of Normandy, must have felt when they were passing judgment on
 the first Camembert.
</code></pre><p>Miss Hibben goes on to say that only a fromage a la creme made in Quebec had come anywhere near her impression of the new Swedish triumph. She quotes the last word from the makers themselves: &quot;This is a very special product that has never been made on this earth before,&quot; and speaks of &quot;the elusive flavor of mushrooms&quot; before summing up, &quot;the exquisitely textured curd and the unexpectedly fresh flavor combine to make it one of the most subtly enjoyable foods that have come my way in a long time.&quot;</p><p>And so say we--all of us.</p><p>Hand Cheese</p><p>Hand cheese has this niche in our Cheese Hall of Fame not because we consider it great, but because it is usually included among the eighteen varieties on which the hundreds of others are based. It is named from having been molded into its final shape by hand. Universally popular with Germanic races, it is too strong for the others. To our mind, Hand cheese never had anything that Allgaeuer or Limburger hasn&#39;t improved upon.</p><p>It is the only cheese that is commonly melted into steins of beer and drunk instead of eaten. It is usually studded with caraway seeds, the most natural spice for curds.</p><p>Limburger</p><p>Limburger has always been popular in America, ever since it was brought over by German-American immigrants; but England never took to it. This is eloquently expressed in the following entry in the English <em>Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery</em>:</p><pre><code> Limburger cheese is chiefly famous for its pungently offensive
 odor. It is made from skimmed milk, and allowed to partially
 decompose before pressing. It is very little known in this
 country, and might be less so with advantage to consumers.
</code></pre><p>But this is libel. Butter-soft and sapid, Limburger has brought gustatory pleasure to millions of hardy gastronomes since it came to light in the province of Luettich in Belgium. It has been Americanized for almost a century and is by now one of the very few cheeses successfully imitated here, chiefly in New York and Wisconsin.</p><p>Early Wisconsiners will never forget the Limburger Rebellion in Green County, when the people rose in protest against the Limburger caravan that was accustomed to park in the little town of Monroe where it was marketed. They threatened to stage a modern Boston Tea Party and dump the odoriferous bricks in the river, when five or six wagonloads were left ripening in the sun in front of the town bank. The Limburger was finally stored safely underground.</p><p>Livarot</p><p>Livarot has been described as decadent, &quot;The very Verlaine of them all,&quot; and Victor Meusy personifies it in a poem dedicated to all the great French cheeses, of which we give a free translation:</p><pre><code>In the dog days
In its overflowing dish
Livarot gesticulates
Or weeps like a child.
</code></pre><p>Muenster</p><pre><code>At the diplomatic banquet
One must choose his piece.
All is politics,
A cheese and a flag.

You annoy the Russians
If you take Chester;
You irritate the Prussians
In choosing Muenster.
</code></pre><p>Victor Meusy</p><p>Like Limburger, this male cheese, often caraway-flavored, does not fare well in England. Although over here we consider Muenster far milder than Limburger, the English writer Eric Weir in <em>When Madame Cooks</em> will have none of it:</p><p>I cannot think why this cheese was not thrown from the aeroplanes during the war to spread panic amongst enemy troops. It would have proved far more efficacious than those nasty deadly gases that kill people permanently.</p><p>Neufchatel</p><pre><code>If the cream cheese be white
Far fairer the hands that made them.

Arthur Hugh Clough
</code></pre><p>Although originally from Normandy, Neufchatel, like Limburger, was so long ago welcomed to America and made so splendidly at home here that we may consider it our very own. All we have against it is that it has served as the model for too many processed abominations.</p><p>Parmesan, Romano, Pecorino, Pecorino Romano</p><p>Parmesan when young, soft and slightly crumbly is eaten on bread. But when well aged, let us say up to a century, it becomes Rock of Gibraltar of cheeses and really suited for grating. It is easy to believe that the so-called &quot;Spanish cheese&quot; used as a barricade by Americans in Nicaragua almost a century ago was none other than the almost indestructible Grana, as Parmesan is called in Italy.</p><p>The association between cheese and battling began in B.C. days with the Jews and Romans, who fed cheese to their soldiers not only for its energy value but as a convenient form of rations, since every army travels on its stomach and can&#39;t go faster than its impedimenta. The last notable mention of cheese in war was the name of the <em>Monitor</em>: &quot;A cheese box on a raft.&quot;</p><p>Romano is not as expensive as Parmesan, although it is as friable, sharp and tangy for flavoring, especially for soups such as onion and minestrone. It is brittle and just off-white when well aged.</p><p>Although made of sheep&#39;s milk, Pecorino is classed with both Parmesan and Romano. All three are excellently imitated in Argentina. Romano and Pecorino Romano are interchangeable names for the strong, medium-sharp and piquant Parmesan types that sell for considerably less. Most of it is now shipped from Sardinia. There are several different kinds: Pecorino Dolce (sweet), Sardo Tuscano, and Pecorino Romano Cacio, which relates it to Caciocavallo.</p><p>Kibitzers complain that some of the cheaper types of Pecorino are soapy, but fans give it high praise. Gillian F., in her &quot;Letter from Italy&quot; in Osbert Burdett&#39;s delectable <em>Little Book of Cheese</em>, writes:</p><pre><code> Out in the orchard, my companion, I don&#39;t remember how, had
 provided the miracle: a flask of wine, a loaf of bread and a slab
 of fresh Pecorino cheese (there wasn&#39;t any &quot;thou&quot; for either) ...
 But that cheese was Paradise; and the flask was emptied, and a
 wood dove cooing made you think that the flask&#39;s contents were in
 a crystal goblet instead of an enamel cup ... one only ... and
 the cheese broken with the fingers ... a cheese of cheeses.
</code></pre><p>Pont L&#39;Eveque</p><p>This semisoft, medium-strong, golden-tinted French classic made since the thirteenth century, is definitely a dessert cheese whose excellence is brought out best by a sound claret or tawny port.</p><p>Port-Salut (<em>See</em> Trappist)</p><p>Provolone</p><p>Within recent years Provolone has taken America by storm, as Camembert, Roquefort, Swiss, Limburger, Neufchatel and such great ones did long before. But it has not been successfully imitated here because the original is made of rich water-buffalo milk unattainable in the Americas.</p><p>With Caciocavallo, this mellow, smoky flavorsome delight is put up in all sorts of artistic forms, red-cellophaned apples, pears, bells, a regular zoo of animals, and in all sorts of sizes, up to a monumental hundred-pound bas-relief imported for exhibition purposes by Phil Alpert.</p><p>Roquefort</p><p>Homage to this <em>fromage!</em> Long hailed as <em>le roi</em> Roquefort, it has filled books and booklets beyond count. By the miracle of <em>Penicillium Roqueforti</em> a new cheese was made. It is placed historically back around the eighth century when Charlemagne was found picking out the green spots of Persille with the point of his knife, thinking them decay. But the monks of Saint-Gall, who were his hosts, recorded in their annals that when they regaled him with Roquefort (because it was Friday and they had no fish) they also made bold to tell him he was wasting the best part of the cheese. So he tasted again, found the advice excellent and liked it so well he ordered two <em>caisses</em> of it sent every year to his palace at Aix-la-Chapelle. He also suggested that it be cut in half first, to make sure it was well veined with blue, and then bound up with a wooden fastening.</p><p>Perhaps he hoped the wood would protect the cheeses from mice and rats, for the good monks of Saint-Gall couldn&#39;t be expected to send an escort of cats from their chalky caves to guard them--even for Charlemagne. There is no telling how many cats were mustered out in the caves, in those early days, but a recent census put the number at five hundred. We can readily imagine the head handler in the caves leading a night inspection with a candle, followed by his chief taster and a regiment of cats. While the Dutch and other makers of cheese also employ cats to patrol their storage caves, Roquefort holds the record for number. An interesting point in this connection is that as rats and mice pick only the prime cheeses, a gnawed one is not thrown away but greatly prized.</p><p>Sapsago, Schabziger or Swiss Green Cheese</p><p>The name Sapsago is a corruption of Schabziger, German for whey cheese. It&#39;s a hay cheese, flavored heavily with melilot, a kind of clover that&#39;s also grown for hay. It comes from Switzerland in a hard, truncated cone wrapped in a piece of paper that says:</p><pre><code>    To be used grated only
    Genuine Swiss Green Cheese
    Made of skimmed milk and herbs

To the housewives! Do you want a change in your meals? Try the
contents of this wrapper! Delicious as spreading mixed with butter,
excellent for flavoring eggs, macaroni, spaghetti, potatoes, soup,
etc. Can be used in place of any other cheese. _Do not take too
much, you might spoil the flavor_.
</code></pre><p>We put this wrapper among our papers, sealed it tight in an envelope, and to this day, six months later, the scent of Sapsago clings &#39;round it still.</p><p>Stilton</p><pre><code> _Honor for Cheeses_

 Literary and munching circles in London are putting quite a lot
 of thought into a proposed memorial to Stilton cheese. There is a
 Stilton Memorial Committee, with Sir John Squire at the head, and
 already the boys are fighting.

 One side, led by Sir John, is all for a monument.

 This, presumably, would not be a replica of Stilton itself,
 although Mr. Epstein could probably hack out a pretty effective
 cheese-shaped figure and call it &quot;Dolorosa.&quot;

 The monument-boosters plan a figure of Mrs. Paulet, who first
 introduced Stilton to England. (Possibly a group showing Mrs.
 Paulet holding a young Stilton by the hand and introducing it,
 while the Stilton curtsies.)

 T.S. Eliot does not think that anyone would look at a monument,
 but wants to establish a Foundation for the Preservation of
 Ancient Cheeses. The practicability of this plan would depend
 largely on the site selected for the treasure house and the cost
 of obtaining a curator who could, or would, give his whole time
 to the work.

 Mr. J.A. Symonds, who is secretary of the committee, agrees with
 Mr. Eliot that a simple statue is not the best form.

 &quot;I should like,&quot; he says, &quot;something irrelevant--gargoyles,
 perhaps.&quot;

 I think that Mr. Symonds has hit on something there.

 I would suggest, if we Americans can pitch into this great
 movement, some gargoyles designed by Mr. Rube Goldberg.

 If the memorial could be devised so as to take on an
 international scope, an exchange fellowship might be established
 between England and America, although the exchange, in the case
 of Stilton, would have to be all on England&#39;s side.

 We might be allowed to furnish the money, however, while England
 furnishes the cheese.

 There is a very good precedent for such a bargain between the two
 countries.

 Robert Benchley, in _After 1903--What?_
</code></pre><p>When all seems lost in England there is still Stilton, an endless after-dinner conversation piece to which England points with pride. For a sound appreciation of this cheese see Clifton Fadiman&#39;s introduction to this book.</p><p>Taleggio and Bel Paese</p><p>When the great Italian cheese-maker, Galbini, first exported Bel Paese some years ago, it was an eloquent ambassador to America. But as the years went on and imitations were made in many lands, Galbini deemed it wise to set up his own factory in <em>our</em> beautiful country. However, the domestic Bel Paese and a minute one-pounder called Bel Paesino just didn&#39;t have that old Alpine zest. They were no better than the German copy called Schoenland, after the original, or the French Fleur des Alpes.</p><p>Mel Fino was a blend of Bel Paese and Gorgonzola. It perked up the market for a full, fruity cheese with snap. Then Galbini hit the jackpot with his Taleggio that fills the need for the sharpest, most sophisticated pungence of them all.</p><p>Trappist, Port-Salut, or Port du Salut, and Oka</p><p>In spite of its name Trappist is no rat-trap commoner. Always of the elect, and better known as Port-Salut or Port du Salut from the original home of the Trappist monks in their chief French abbey, it is also set apart from the ordinary Canadians under the name of Oka, from the Trappist monastery there. It is made by Trappist monks all over the world, according to the original secret formula, and by Trappist Cistercian monks at the Abbey of Gethsemani Trappist in Kentucky.</p><p>This is a soft cheese, creamy and of superb flavor. You can&#39;t go wrong if you look for the monastery name stamped on, such as Harze in Belgium, Mont-des-Cats in Flanders, Sainte Anne d&#39;Auray in Brittany, and so forth.</p><p>Last but not least, a commercial Port-Salut entirely without benefit of clergy or monastery is made in Milwaukee under the Lion Brand. It is one of the finest American cheeses in which we have ever sunk a fang.</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p><em>Chapter Four</em></p><p>Native Americans</p><p>American Cheddars</p><p>The first American Cheddar was made soon after 1620 around Plymouth by Pilgrim fathers who brought along not only cheese from the homeland but a live cow to continue the supply. Proof of our ability to manufacture Cheddar of our own lies in the fact that by 1790 we were exporting it back to England.</p><p>It was called Cheddar after the English original named for the village of Cheddar near Bristol. More than a century ago it made a new name for itself, Herkimer County cheese, from the section of New York State where it was first made best. Herkimer still equals its several distinguished competitors, Coon, Colorado Blackie, California Jack, Pineapple, Sage, Vermont Colby and Wisconsin Longhorn.</p><p>The English called our imitation Yankee, or American, Cheddar, while here at home it was popularly known as yellow or store cheese from its prominent position in every country store; also apple-pie cheese because of its affinity for the all-American dessert.</p><p>The first Cheddar factory was founded by Jesse Williams in Rome, New York, just over a century ago and, with Herkimer County Cheddar already widely known, this established &quot;New York&quot; as the preferred &quot;store-boughten&quot; cheese.</p><p>An account of New York&#39;s cheese business in the pioneer Wooden Nutmeg Era is found in Ernest Elmo Calkins&#39; interesting book, <em>They Broke the Prairies</em>. A Yankee named Silvanus Ferris, &quot;the most successful dairyman of Herkimer County,&quot; in the first decades of the 1800&#39;s teamed up with Robert Nesbit, &quot;the old Quaker Cheese Buyer.&quot; They bought from farmers in the region and sold in New York City. And &quot;according to the business ethics of the times,&quot; Nesbit went ahead to cheapen the cheese offered by deprecating its quality, hinting at a bad market and departing without buying. Later when Ferris arrived in a more optimistic mood, offering a slightly better price, the seller, unaware they were partners, and ignorant of the market price, snapped up the offer.</p><p>Similar sharp-trade tactics put too much green cheese on the market, so those honestly aged from a minimum of eight months up to two years fetched higher prices. They were called &quot;old,&quot; such as Old Herkimer, Old Wisconsin Longhorn, and Old California Jack.</p><p>Although the established Cheddar ages are three, fresh, medium-cured, and cured or aged, commercially they are divided into two and described as mild and sharp. The most popular are named for their states: Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Vermont and Wisconsin. Two New York Staters are called and named separately, Coon and Herkimer County. Tillamook goes by its own name with no mention of Oregon. Pineapple, Monterey Jack and Sage are seldom listed as Cheddars at all, although they are basically that.</p><p>Brick</p><p>Brick is the one and only cheese for which the whole world gives America credit. Runners-up are Liederkranz, which rivals say is too close to Limburger, and Pineapple, which is only a Cheddar under its crisscrossed, painted and flavored rind. Yet Brick is no more distinguished than either of the hundred percent Americans, and in our opinion is less worth bragging about.</p><p>It is a medium-firm, mild-to-strong slicing cheese for sandwiches and melting in hot dishes. Its texture is elastic but not rubbery, its taste sweetish, and it is full of little round holes or eyes. All this has inspired enthusiasts to liken it to Emmentaler. The most appropriate name for it has long been &quot;married man&#39;s Limburger.&quot; To make up for the mildness caraway seed is sometimes added.</p><p>About Civil War time, John Jossi, a dairyman of Dodge County, Wisconsin, came up with this novelty, a rennet cheese made of whole cow&#39;s milk. The curd is cut like Cheddar, heated, stirred and cooked firm to put in a brick-shaped box without a bottom and with slits in the sides to drain. When this is set on the draining table a couple of bricks are also laid on the cooked curd for pressure. It is this double use of bricks, for shaping and for pressing, that has led to the confusion about which came first in originating the name.</p><p>The formed &quot;bricks&quot; of cheese are rubbed with salt for three days and they ripen slowly, taking up to two months.</p><p>We eat several million pounds a year and 95 percent of that comes from Wisconsin, with a trickle from New York.</p><p>Colorado Blackie Cheese</p><p>A subtly different American Cheddar is putting Colorado on our cheese map. It is called Blackie from the black-waxed rind and it resembles Vermont State cheese, although it is flatter. This is a proud new American product, proving that although Papa Cheddar was born in England his American kinfolk have developed independent and valuable characters all on their own.</p><p>Coon Cheese</p><p>Coon cheese is full of flavor from being aged on shelves at a higher temperature than cold storage. Its rind is darker from the growth of mold and this shade is sometimes painted on more ordinary Cheddars to make them look like Coon, which always brings a 10 percent premium above the general run.</p><p>Made at Lowville, New York, it has received high praise from a host of admirers, among them the French cook, Clementine, in Phineas Beck&#39;s <em>Kitchen</em>, who raised it to the par of French immortals by calling it Fromage de Coon. Clementine used it &quot;with scintillating success in countless French recipes which ended with the words <em>gratiner au four et servir tres chaud</em>. She made <em>baguettes</em> of it by soaking sticks three-eights-inch square and one and a half inches long in lukewarm milk, rolling them in flour, beaten egg and bread crumbs and browning them instantaneously in boiling oil.&quot;</p><p>Herkimer County Cheese</p><p>The standard method for making American Cheddar was established in Herkimer County, New York, in 1841 and has been rigidly maintained down to this day. Made with rennet and a bacterial &quot;starter,&quot; the curd is cut and pressed to squeeze out all of the whey and then aged in cylindrical forms for a year or more.</p><p>Herkimer leads the whole breed by being flaky, brittle, sharp and nutty, with a crumb that will crumble, and a soft, mouth-watering pale orange color when it is properly aged.</p><p>Isigny</p><p>Isigny is a native American cheese that came a cropper. It seems to be extinct now, and perhaps that is all to the good, for it never meant to be anything more than another Camembert, of which we have plenty of imitation.</p><p>Not long after the Civil War the attempt was made to perfect Isigny. The curd was carefully prepared according to an original formula, washed and rubbed and set aside to come of age. But when it did, alas, it was more like Limburger than Camembert, and since good domestic Limburger was then a dime a pound, obviously it wouldn&#39;t pay off. Yet in shape the newborn resembled Camembert, although it was much larger. So they cut it down and named it after the delicate French Creme d&#39;lsigny.</p><p>Jack, California Jack and Monterey Jack</p><p>Jack was first known as Monterey cheese from the California county where it originated. Then it was called Jack for short, and only now takes its full name after sixty years of popularity on the West Coast. Because it is little known in the East and has to be shipped so far, it commands the top Cheddar price.</p><p>Monterey Jack is a stirred curd Cheddar without any annatto coloring. It is sweeter than most and milder when young, but it gets sharper with age and more expensive because of storage costs.</p><p>Liederkranz</p><p>No native American cheese has been so widely ballyhooed, and so deservedly, as Liederkranz, which translates &quot;Wreath of Song.&quot;</p><p>Back in the gay, inventive nineties, Emil Frey, a young delicatessen keeper in New York, tried to please some bereft customers by making an imitation of Bismarck Schlosskaese. This was imperative because the imported German cheese didn&#39;t stand up during the long sea trip and Emil&#39;s customers, mostly members of the famous Liederkranz singing society, didn&#39;t feel like singing without it. But Emil&#39;s attempts at imitation only added indigestion to their dejection, until one day--<em>fabelhaft!</em> One of those cheese dream castles in Spain came true. He turned out a tawny, altogether golden, tangy and mellow little marvel that actually was an improvement on Bismarck&#39;s old Schlosskaese. Better than Brick, it was a deodorized Limburger, both a man&#39;s cheese and one that cheese-conscious women adored.</p><p>Emil named it &quot;Wreath of Song&quot; for the Liederkranz customers. It soon became as internationally known as tabasco from Texas or Parisian Camembert which it slightly resembles. Borden&#39;s bought out Frey in 1929 and they enjoy telling the story of a G.I. who, to celebrate V-E Day in Paris, sent to his family in Indiana, only a few miles from the factory at Van Wert, Ohio, a whole case of what he had learned was &quot;the finest cheese France could make.&quot; And when the family opened it, there was Liederkranz.</p><p>Another deserved distinction is that of being sandwiched in between two foreign immortals in the following recipe:</p><p>Schnitzelbank Pot</p><p>1 ripe Camembert cheese 1 Liederkranz 1/8 pound imported Roquefort 1/4 pound butter 1 tablespoon flour 1 cup cream 1/2 cup finely chopped olives 1/4 cup canned pimiento A sprinkling of cayenne</p><pre><code> Depending on whether or not you like the edible rind of Camembert
 and Liederkranz, you can leave it on, scrape any thick part off,
 or remove it all. Mash the soft creams together with the
 Roquefort, butter and flour, using a silver fork. Put the mix
 into an enameled pan, for anything with a metal surface will
 turn the cheese black in cooking.

 Stir in the cream and keep stirring until you have a smooth,
 creamy sauce. Strain through sieve or cheesecloth, and mix in the
 olives and pimiento thoroughly. Sprinkle well with cayenne and
 put into a pot to mellow for a few days, or much longer.
</code></pre><p>The name <em>Schnitzelbank</em> comes from &quot;school bench,&quot; a game. This snappy-sweet pot is specially suited to a beer party and stein songs. It is also the affinity-spread with rye and pumpernickel, and may be served in small sandwiches or on crackers, celery and such, to make appetizing tidbits for cocktails, tea, or cider.</p><p>Like the trinity of cheeses that make it, the mixture is eaten best at room temperature, when its flavor is fullest. If kept in the refrigerator, it should be taken out a couple of hours before serving. Since it is a natural cheese mixture, which has gone through no process or doping with preservative, it will not keep more than two weeks. This mellow-sharp mix is the sort of ideal the factory processors shoot at with their olive-pimiento abominations. Once you&#39;ve potted your own, you&#39;ll find it gives the same thrill as garnishing your own Liptauer.</p><p>Minnesota Blue</p><p>The discovery of sandstone caves in the bluffs along the Mississippi, in and near the Twin Cities of Minnesota, has established a distinctive type of Blue cheese named for the state. Although the Roquefort process of France is followed and the cheese is inoculated in the same way by mold from bread, it can never equal the genuine imported, marked with its red-sheep brand, because the milk used in Minnesota Blue is cow&#39;s milk, and the caves are sandstone instead of limestone. Yet this is an excellent, Blue cheese in its own right.</p><p>Pineapple</p><p>Pineapple cheese is named after its shape rather than its flavor, although there are rumors that some pineapple flavor is noticeable near the oiled rind. This flavor does not penetrate through to the Cheddar center. Many makers of processed cheese have tampered with the original, so today you can&#39;t be sure of anything except getting a smaller size every year or two, at a higher price. Originally six pounds, the Pineapple has shrunk to nearly six ounces. The proper bright-orange, oiled and shellacked surface is more apt to be a sickly lemon.</p><p>Always an ornamental cheese, it once stood in state on the side-board under a silver bell also made to represent a pineapple. You cut a top slice off the cheese, just as you would off the fruit, and there was a rose-colored, fine-tasting, mellow-hard cheese to spoon out with a special silver cheese spoon or scoop. Between meals the silver top was put on the silver holder and the oiled and shellacked rind kept the cheese moist. Even when the Pineapple was eaten down to the rind the shell served as a dunking bowl to fill with some salubrious cold Fondue or salad.</p><p>Made in the same manner as Cheddar with the curd cooked harder, Pineapple&#39;s distinction lies in being hung in a net that makes diamond-shaped corrugations on the surface, simulating the sections of the fruit. It is a pioneer American product with almost a century and a half of service since Lewis M. Norton conceived it in 1808 in Litchfield County, Connecticut. There in 1845 he built a factory and made a deserved fortune out of his decorative ingenuity with what before had been plain, unromantic yellow or store cheese.</p><p>Perhaps his inspiration came from cone-shaped Cheshire in old England, also called Pineapple cheese, combined with the hanging up of Provolones in Italy that leaves the looser pattern of the four sustaining strings.</p><p>Sage, Vermont Sage and Vermont State</p><p>The story of Sage cheese, or green cheese as it was called originally, shows the several phases most cheeses have gone through, from their simple, honest beginnings to commercialization, and sometimes back to the real thing.</p><p>The English <em>Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery</em> has an early Sage recipe:</p><pre><code> This is a species of cream cheese made by adding sage leaves and
 greening to the milk. A very good receipt for it is given thus:
 Bruise the tops of fresh young red sage leaves with an equal
 quantity of spinach leaves and squeeze out the juice. Add this to
 the extract of rennet and stir into the milk as much as your
 taste may deem sufficient. Break the curd when it comes, salt it,
 fill the vat high with it, press for a few hours, and then turn
 the cheese every day.
</code></pre><p><em>Fancy Cheese in America, lay</em> Charles A. Publow, records the commercialization of the cheese mentioned above, a century or two later, in 1910:</p><pre><code> Sage cheese is another modified form of the Cheddar variety. Its
 distinguishing features are a mottled green color and a sage
 flavor. The usual method of manufacture is as follows: One-third
 of the total amount of milk is placed in a vat by itself and
 colored green by the addition of eight to twelve ounces of
 commercial sage color to each 1,000 pounds of milk. If green corn
 leaves (unavailable in England) or other substances are used for
 coloring, the amounts will vary accordingly. The milk is then
 made up by the regular Cheddar method, as is also the remaining
 two-thirds, in a separate vat. At the time of removing the whey
 the green and white curds are mixed. Some prefer, however, to mix
 the curds at the time of milling, as a more distinct color is
 secured. After milling, the sage extract flavoring is sprayed
 over the curd with an atomizer. The curd is then salted and
 pressed into the regular Cheddar shapes and sizes.

 A very satisfactory Sage cheese is made at the New York State
 College of Agriculture by simply dropping green coloring, made
 from the leaves of corn and spinach, upon the curd, after
 milling. An even green mottling is thus easily secured without
 additional labor. Sage flavoring extract is sprayed over the curd
 by an atomizer. One-half ounce of flavoring is usually sufficient
 for a hundred pounds of curd and can be secured from dairy supply
 houses.
</code></pre><p>A modern cheese authority reported on the current (1953) method:</p><pre><code> Instead of sage leaves, or tea prepared from them, at present the
 cheese is flavored with oil of Dalmatian wild sage because it has
 the sharpest flavor. This piny oil, thujone, is diluted with
 water, 250 parts to one, and either added to the milk or sprayed
 over the curds, one-eighth ounce for 500 quarts of milk.
</code></pre><p>In scouting around for a possible maker of the real thing today, we wrote to Vrest Orton of Vermont, and got this reply:</p><pre><code> Sage cheese is one of the really indigenous and best native
 Vermont products. So far as I know, there is only one factory
 making it and that is my friend, George Crowley&#39;s. He makes a
 limited amount for my Vermont Country Store. It is the fine
 old-time full cream cheese, flavored with real sage.

 On this hangs a tale. Some years ago I couldn&#39;t get enough sage
 cheese (we never can) so I asked a Wisconsin cheesemaker if he
 would make some. Said he would but couldn&#39;t at that time--because
 the alfalfa wasn&#39;t ripe. I said, &quot;What in hell has alfalfa got to
 do with sage cheese?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, we flavor the sage cheese
 with a synthetic sage flavor and then throw in some pieces of
 chopped-up alfalfa to make it look green.&quot;

 So I said to hell with that and the next time I saw George
 Crowley I told him the story and George said, &quot;We don&#39;t use
 synthetic flavor, alfalfa or anything like that.&quot;

 &quot;Then what do you use, George?&quot; I inquired.

 &quot;We use real sage.&quot;

 &quot;Why?&quot;

 &quot;Well, because it&#39;s cheaper than that synthetic stuff.&quot;

 flower with the Sage. There&#39;s a slight burned savor recalling
 smoked cheese, although not related in any way. Mildly resinous
 like that Near East one packed in pine, suggesting the well-saged
 dressing of a turkey. A round mouthful of luscious mellowness,
 with a bouquet--a snapping reminder to the nose. And there&#39;s just
 a soupcon of new-mown hay above the green freckles of herb to
 delight the eye and set the fancy free. So this is the _veritable
 vert_, green cheese--the moon is made of it! _Vert veritable._ A
 general favorite with everybody who ever tasted it, for
 generations of lusty crumblers.
</code></pre><p>Old-Fashioned Vermont State Store Cheese</p><p>We received from savant Vrest Orton another letter, together with some Vermont store cheese and some crackers.</p><pre><code> This cheese is our regular old-fashioned store cheese--it&#39;s been
 in old country stores for generations and we have been pioneers
 in spreading the word about it. It is, of course, a natural aged
 cheese, no processing, no fussing, no fooling with it. It&#39;s made
 the same way it was back in 1870, by the old-time Colby method
 which makes a cheese which is not so dry as Cheddar and also has
 holes in it, something like Swiss. Also, it ages faster.

 Did you know that during the last part of the nineteenth century
 and part of the twentieth, Vermont was the leading cheesemaking
 state in the Union? When I was a lad, every town in Vermont had
 one or more cheese factories. Now there are only two left--not
 counting any that make process. Process isn&#39;t cheese!

 The crackers are the old-time store cracker--every Vermonter
 used to buy a big barrel once a year to set in the buttery and
 eat. A classic dish is crackers, broken up in a bowl of cold
 milk, with a hunk of Vermont cheese like this on the side. Grand
 snack, grand midnight supper, grand anything. These crackers are
 not sweet, not salt, and as such make a good base for
 anything--swell with clam chowder, also with toasted cheese....

Volume I is entitled <em>Cheese Cheddar</em>, and Volume II is a two-pound Cheddar cheese labeled Tillamook and molded to fit inside its book jacket. We borrowed Volume I from a noted <em>litterateur</em>, and never could get him to come across with Volume II. We guessed its fate, however, from a note on the flyleaf of the only tome available: &quot;This is an excellent cheese, full cream and medium sharp, and a unique set of books in which Volume II suggests Bacon&#39;s: &#39;Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.&#39;&quot;</p><p>Wisconsin Longhorn</p><p>Since we began this chapter with all-American Cheddars, it is only fitting to end with Wisconsin Longhorn, a sort of national standard, even though it&#39;s not nearly so fancy or high-priced as some of the regional natives that can&#39;t approach its enormous output.

 Charles Lamb, IN A LETTER TO COLERIDGE
</code></pre><p>Unlike the beginning of the classical Jugged Hare recipe: &quot;First catch your hare!&quot; we modern Rabbit-hunters start off with &quot;First catch your Cheddar!&quot; And some of us go so far as to smuggle in formerly forbidden <em>fromages</em> such as Gruyere, Neufchatel, Parmesan, and mixtures thereof. We run the gamut of personal preferences in selecting the Rabbit cheese itself, from old-time American, yellow or store cheese, to Coon and Canadian-smoked, though all of it is still Cheddar, no matter how you slice it.</p><p>Then, too, guests are made to run the gauntlet of all-American trimmings from pin-money pickles to peanut butter, succotash and maybe marshmallows; we add mustard, chill, curry, tabasco and sundry bottled red devils from the grocery store, to add pep and piquance to the traditional cayenne and black pepper. This results in Rabbits that are out of focus, out of order and out of this world.</p><p>Among modern sins of omission, the Worcestershire sauce is left out by braggarts who aver that they can take it or leave it. And, in these degenerate days, when it comes to substitutions for the original beer or stale pale ale, we find the gratings of great Cheddars wet down with mere California sherry or even ginger ale--yet so far, thank goodness, no Cokes. And there&#39;s tomato juice out of a can into the Rum Turn Tiddy, and sometimes celery soup in place of milk or cream.</p><p>In view of all this, we can only look to the standard cookbooks for salvation. These are mostly compiled by women, our thoughtful mothers, wives and sweethearts who have saved the twin Basic Rabbits for us. If it weren&#39;t for these Fanny Farmers, the making of a real aboriginal Welsh Rabbit would be a lost art--lost in sporting male attempts to improve upon the original.</p><p>The girls are still polite about the whole thing and protectively pervert the original spelling of &quot;Rabbit&quot; to &quot;Rarebit&quot; in their culinary guides. We have heard that once a club of ladies in high society tried to high-pressure the publishers of Mr. Webster&#39;s dictionary to change the old spelling in their favor. Yet there is a lot to be said for this more genteel and appetizing rendering of the word, for the Welsh masterpiece is, after all, a very rare bit of cheesemongery, male or female.</p><p>Yet in dealing with &quot;Rarebits&quot; the distaff side seldom sets down more than the basic Adam and Eve in a whole Paradise of Rabbits: No. 1, the wild male type made with beer, and No. 2, the mild female made with milk. Yet now that the chafing dish has come back to stay, there&#39;s a flurry in the Rabbit warren and the new cooking encyclopedias give up to a dozen variants. Actually there are easily half a gross of valid ones in current esteem.</p><p>The two basic recipes are differentiated by the liquid ingredient, but both the beer and the milk are used only one way--warm, or anyway at room temperature. And again for the two, there is but one traditional cheese--Cheddar, ripe, old or merely aged from six months onward. This is also called American, store, sharp, Rabbit, yellow, beer, Wisconsin Longhorn, mouse, and even rat.</p><p>The seasoned, sapid Cheddar-type, so indispensable, includes dozens of varieties under different names, regional or commercial. These are easily identified as sisters-under-the-rinds by all five senses:</p><pre><code> sight: Golden yellow and mellow to the eye. It&#39;s one of those
 round cheeses that also tastes round in the mouth.

 hearing: By thumping, a cheese-fancier, like a melon-picker,
 can tell if a Cheddar is rich, ripe and ready for the Rabbit.
 When you hear your dealer say, &quot;It&#39;s six months old or more,&quot;
 enough said.

 smell: A scent as fresh as that of the daisies and herbs the
 mother milk cow munched &quot;will hang round it still.&quot; Also a slight
 beery savor.

 touch: Crumbly--a caress to the fingers.

 taste: The quintessence of this fivefold test. Just cuddle a
 crumb with your tongue and if it tickles the taste buds it&#39;s
 prime. When it melts in your mouth, that&#39;s proof it will melt in
 the pan.
</code></pre><p>Beyond all this (and in spite of the school that plumps for the No. 2 temperance alternative) we must point out that beer has a special affinity for Cheddar. The French have clearly established this in their names for Welsh Rabbit, <em>Fromage Fondue a la Biere</em> and <em>Fondue a l&#39;Anglaise</em>.</p><p>To prepare such a cheese for the pan, each Rabbit hound may have a preference all his own, for here the question comes up of how it melts best. Do you shave, slice, dice, shred, mince, chop, cut, scrape or crumble it in the fingers? This will vary according to one&#39;s temperament and the condition of the cheese. Generally, for best results it is coarsely grated. When it comes to making all this into a rare bit of Rabbit there is:</p><p>The One and Only Method</p><p>Use a double boiler, or preferably a chafing dish, avoiding aluminum and other soft metals. Heat the upper pan by simmering water in the lower one, but don&#39;t let the water boil up or touch the top pan.</p><p>Most, but not all, Rabbits are begun by heating a bit of butter or margarine in the pan in which one cup of roughly grated cheese, usually sharp Cheddar, is melted and mixed with one-half cup of liquid, added gradually. (The butter isn&#39;t necessary for a cheese that should melt by itself.)</p><p>The two principal ingredients are melted smoothly together and kept from curdling by stirring steadily in one direction only, over an even heat. The spoon used should be of hard wood, sterling silver or porcelain. Never use tin, aluminum or soft metal--the taste may come off to taint the job.</p><p>Be sure the liquid is at room temperature, or warmer, and add it gradually, without interrupting the stirring. Do not let it come to the bubbling point, and never let it boil.</p><p>Add seasonings only when the cheese is melted, which will take two or three minutes. Then continue to stir in the same direction without an instant&#39;s letup, for maybe ten minutes or more, until the Rabbit is smooth. The consistency and velvety smoothness depend a good deal on whether or not an egg, or a beaten yolk, is added.</p><p>The hotter the Rabbit is served, the better. You can sizzle the top with a salamander or other branding iron, but in any case set it forth as nearly sizzling as possible, on toast hellishly hot, whether it&#39;s browned or buttered on one side or both.</p><p>Give a thought to the sad case of the &quot;little dog whose name was Rover, and when he was dead he was dead all over.&quot; Something very similar happens with a Rabbit that&#39;s allowed to cool down--when it&#39;s cold it&#39;s cold all over, and you can&#39;t resuscitate it by heating.</p><p>BASIC WELSH RABBIT</p><p>No. 1 (with beer)</p><p>2 tablespoons butter 3 cups grated old Cheddar 1/2 teaspoon English dry mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt A dash of cayenne 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 egg yolks, lightly beaten with 1/2 cup light beer or ale 4 slices hot buttered toast</p><pre><code> Over boiling water melt butter and cheese together, stirring
 steadily with a wooden (or other tasteless) spoon in one
 direction only. Add seasonings and do not interrupt your rhythmic
 stirring, as you pour in a bit at a time of the beer-and-egg
 mixture until it&#39;s all used up.

 It may take many minutes of constant stirring to achieve the
 essential creamy thickness and then some more to slick it out as
 smooth as velvet.

 Keep it piping hot but don&#39;t let it bubble, for a boiled Rabbit
 is a spoiled Rabbit. Only unremitting stirring (and the best of
 cheese) will keep it from curdling, getting stringy or rubbery.
 Pour the Rabbit generously over crisp, freshly buttered toast
 and serve instantly on hot plates.
</code></pre><p>Usually crusts are cut off the bread before toasting, and some aesthetes toast one side only, spreading the toasted side with cold butter for taste contrast. Lay the toast on the hot plate, buttered side down, and pour the Rabbit over the porous untoasted side so it can soak in. (This is recommended in Lady Llanover&#39;s recipe, which appears on page 52 of this book.)</p><p>Although the original bread for Rabbit toast was white, there is now no limit in choice among whole wheat, graham, rolls, muffins, buns, croutons and crackers, to infinity.</p><p>No. 2 (with milk)</p><p>For a rich milk Rabbit use 1/2 cup thin cream, evaporated milk, whole milk or buttermilk, instead of beer as in No. 1. Then, to keep everything bland, cut down the mustard by half or leave it out, and use paprika in place of cayenne. As in No. 1, the use of Worcestershire sauce is optional, although our feeling is that any spirited Rabbit would resent its being left out.</p><p>Either of these basic recipes can be made without eggs, and more cheaply, although the beaten egg is a guarantee against stringiness. When the egg is missing, we are sad to record that a teaspoon or so of cornstarch generally takes its place.</p><p>Rabbiteers are of two minds about fast and slow heating and stirring, so you&#39;ll have to adjust that to your own experience and rhythm. As a rule, the heat is reduced when the cheese is almost melted, and speed of stirring slows when the eggs and last ingredients go in.</p><p>Many moderns who have found that monosodium glutamate steps up the flavor of natural cheese, put it in at the start, using one-half teaspoon for each cup of grated Cheddar. When it comes to pepper you are fancy-free. As both black and white pepper are now held in almost equal esteem, you might equip your hutch with twin hand-mills to do the grinding fresh, for this is always worth the trouble. Tabasco sauce is little used and needs a cautious hand, but some addicts can&#39;t leave it out any more than they can swear off the Worcestershire.</p><p>The school that plumps for malty Rabbits and the other that goes for milky ones are equally emphatic in their choice. So let us consider the compromise of our old friend Frederick Philip Stieff, the Baltimore <em>homme de bouche</em>, as he set it forth for us years ago in <em>10,000 Snacks</em>: &quot;The idea of cooking a Rabbit with beer is an exploded and dangerous theory. Tap your keg or open your case of ale or beer and serve <em>with</em>, not in your Rabbit.&quot;</p><p>The Stieff Recipe BASIC MILK RABBIT (<em>completely surrounded by a lake of malt beverages</em>)</p><p>2 cups grated sharp cheese 3 heaping tablespoons butter 1-1/2 cups milk 4 eggs 1 heaping tablespoon mustard 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce Pepper, salt and paprika to taste--then add more of each.</p><pre><code> Grease well with butter the interior of your double boiler so
 that no hard particles of cheese will form in the mixture later
 and contribute undesirable lumps.

 Put cheese, well-grated, into the double boiler and add butter
 and milk. From this point vigorous stirring should be indulged in
 until Rabbit is ready for serving.

 Prepare a mixture of Worcestershire sauce, mustard, pepper, salt
 and paprika. These should be beaten until light and then slowly
 poured into the double boiler. Nothing now remains to be done
 except to stir and cook down to proper consistency over a fairly
 slow flame. The finale has not arrived until you can drip the
 rabbit from the spoon and spell the word _finis_ on the surface.
 Pour over two pieces of toast per plate and send anyone home who
 does not attack it at once.

 This is sufficient for six gourmets or four gourmands.

 milk; toast it at the fire on both sides, but not so much as to
 drop (melt). Toast on one side a piece of bread less than 1/4
 inch thick, to be quite crisp, and spread it very thinly with
 fresh, cold butter on the toasted side. (It must not be
 saturated.) Lay the toasted cheese upon the untoasted bread side
 and serve immediately on a very hot plate. The butter on the
 toast can, of course, be omitted. (It is more frequently eaten
 without butter.)
</code></pre><p>From this original toasting of the cheese many Englishmen still call Welsh Rabbit &quot;Toasted Cheese,&quot; but Lady Llanover goes on to point out that the Toasted Rabbit of her Wales and the Melted or Stewed Buck Rabbit of England (which has become our American standard) are as different in the making as the regional cheeses used in them, and she says that while doctors prescribed the toasted Welsh as salubrious for invalids, the stewed cheese of Olde England was &quot;only adapted to strong digestions.&quot;</p><p>English literature rings with praise for the toasted cheese of Wales and England. There is Christopher North&#39;s eloquent &quot;threads of unbeaten gold, shining like gossamer filaments (that may be pulled from its tough and tenacious substance).&quot;</p><p>Yet not all of the references are complimentary.</p><p>Thus Shakespeare in <em>King Lear</em>:</p><pre><code>Look, look a mouse!

 The Lord had been complaining to St. Peter of the dearth of good
 singers in Heaven. &quot;Yet,&quot; He said testily, &quot;I hear excellent
 singing outside the walls. Why are not those singers here with
 me?&quot;

 St. Peter said, &quot;They are the Welsh. They refuse to come in; they
 say they are happy enough outside, playing with a ball and boxing
 and singing such songs as &#39;_Suspan Fach_&#39;&quot;

 The Lord said, &quot;I wish them to come in here to sing Bach and
 Mendelssohn. See that they are in before sundown.&quot;

 St. Peter went to the Welsh and gave them the commands of the
 Lord. But still they shook their heads. Harassed, St. Peter went
 to consult with St. David, who, with a smile, was reading the
 works of Caradoc Evans.

 St. David said, &quot;Try toasted cheese. Build a fire just inside the
 gates and get a few angels to toast cheese in front of it&quot; This
 St. Peter did. The heavenly aroma of the sizzling, browning
 cheese was wafted over the walls and, with loud shouts, a great
 concourse of the Welsh came sprinting in. When sufficient were
 inside to make up a male voice choir of a hundred, St Peter
 slammed the gates. However, it is said that these are the only
 Welsh in Heaven.

The Welshman he near swallowed a mouse
  But he pulled it out by the tail.
</code></pre><p>And, perhaps worst of all, Shakespeare, no cheese-lover, this tune in <em>Merry Wives of Windsor</em>:</p><pre><code>&#39;Tis time I were choked by a bit of toasted cheese.
</code></pre><p>An elaboration of the simple Welsh original went English with Dr. William Maginn, the London journalist whose facile pen enlivened the <em>Blackwoods Magazine</em> era with <em>Ten Tales</em>:</p><pre><code> [Illustration] Dr. Maginn&#39;s Rabbit

 Much is to be said in favor of toasted cheese for supper. It is
 the cant to say that Welsh rabbit is heavy eating. I like it best
 in the genuine Welsh way, however--that is, the toasted bread
 buttered on both sides profusely, then a layer of cold roast beef
 with mustard and horseradish, and then, on the top of all, the
 superstratum, of Cheshire _thoroughly_ saturated, while, in the
 process of toasting, with genuine porter, black pepper, and
 shallot vinegar. I peril myself upon the assertion that this is
 not a heavy supper for a man who has been busy all day till
 dinner in reading, writing, walking or riding--who has occupied
 himself between dinner and supper in the discussion of a bottle
 or two of sound wine, or any equivalent--and who proposes to
 swallow at least three tumblers of something hot ere he resigns
 himself to the embrace of Somnus. With these provisos, I
 recommend toasted cheese for supper.
</code></pre><p>The popularity of this has come down to us in the succinct summing-up, &quot;Toasted cheese hath no master.&quot;</p><p>The Welsh original became simple after Dr. Maginn&#39;s supper sandwich was served, a century and a half ago; for it was served as a savory to sum up and help digest a dinner, in this form:</p><p>After-Dinner Rabbit</p><pre><code> Remove all crusts from bread slices, toast on both sides and soak
 to saturation in hot beer. Melt thin slices of sharp old cheese
 in butter in an iron skillet, with an added spot of beer and dry
 English mustard. Stir steadily with a wooden spoon and, when
 velvety, serve a-sizzle on piping hot beer-soaked toast.
</code></pre><p>While toasted cheese undoubtedly was the Number One dairy dish of Anglo-Saxons, stewed cheese came along to rival it in Elizabethan London. This sophisticated, big-city dish, also called a Buck Rabbit, was the making of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese on Fleet Street, where Dr. Johnson later presided. And it must have been the pick of the town back in the days when barrooms still had sawdust on the floor, for the learned Doctor endorsed old Omar Khayyam&#39;s love of the pub with: &quot;There is nothing which has been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern.&quot; Yet he was no gourmet, as may be judged by his likening of a succulent, golden-fried oyster to &quot;a baby&#39;s ear dropped in sawdust.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps it is just as well that no description of the world&#39;s first Golden Buck has come down from him. But we don&#39;t have to look far for on-the-spot pen pictures by other men of letters at &quot;The Cheese,&quot; as it was affectionately called. To a man they sang praises for that piping hot dish of preserved and beatified milk.</p><p>Inspired by stewed cheese, Mark Lemon, the leading rhymester of <em>Punch</em>, wrote the following poem and dedicated it to the memory of Lovelace:</p><pre><code>Champagne will not a dinner make,
  Nor caviar a meal
Men gluttonous and rich may take
  Those till they make them ill
    If I&#39;ve potatoes to my chop,
    And after chop have cheese,
    Angels in Pond and Spiers&#39;s shop
    Know no such luxuries.
</code></pre><p>All that&#39;s necessary is an old-time &quot;cheese stewer&quot; or a reasonable substitute. The base of this is what was once quaintly called a &quot;hot-water bath.&quot; This was a sort of miniature wash boiler just big enough to fit in snugly half a dozen individual tins, made squarish and standing high enough above the bath water to keep any of it from getting into the stew. In these tins the cheese is melted. But since such a tinsmith&#39;s contraption is hard to come by in these days of fireproof cooking glass, we suggest muffin tins, ramekins or even small cups to crowd into the bottom of your double boiler or chafing dish. But beyond this we plump for a revival of the &quot;cheese stewer&quot; in stainless steel, silver or glass.</p><p>In the ritual at &quot;The Cheese,&quot; these dishes, brimming over, &quot;bubbling and blistering with the stew,&quot; followed a pudding that&#39;s still famous. Although down the centuries the recipe has been kept secret, the identifiable ingredients have been itemized as follows: &quot;Tender steak, savory oyster, seductive kidney, fascinating lark, rich gravy, ardent pepper and delicate paste&quot;--not to mention mushrooms. And after the second or third helping of pudding, with a pint of stout, bitter, or the mildest and mellowest brown October Ale in a dented pewter pot, &quot;the stewed Cheshire cheese.&quot;</p><p>Cheese was the one and only other course prescribed by tradition and appetite from the time when Charles II aled and regaled Nell Gwyn at &quot;The Cheese,&quot; where Shakespeare is said to have sampled this &quot;kind of a glorified Welsh Rarebit, served piping hot in the square shallow tins in which it is cooked and garnished with sippets of delicately colored toast.&quot;</p><p>Among early records is this report of Addison&#39;s in <em>The Spectator</em> of September 25,1711:</p><pre><code> They yawn for a Cheshire cheese, and begin about midnight, when
 the whole company is disposed to be drowsy. He that yawns widest,
 and at the same time so naturally as to produce the most yawns
 amongst his spectators, carries home the cheese.

He would set forth a huge portion of cheese and wager champagne and cigars for the house that no one present could correctly estimate the weight, height and girth of it.</p><p>As late as 1795, when Boswell was accompanying Dr. Johnson to &quot;The Cheese,&quot; records of St. Dunstan&#39;s Club, which also met there, showed that the current price of a Buck Rabbit was tuppence, and that this was also the amount of the usual tip.</p><p>Ye Original Recipe</p><p>1-1/2 ounces butter 1 cup cream 1-1/2 cups grated Cheshire cheese (more pungent, snappier, richer, and more brightly colored than its first cousin, Cheddar)</p><pre><code> Heat butter and cream together, then stir in the cheese and let

 You dunk fingers of toast directly into your individual tin, or
 pour the Stewed Rabbit over toast and brown the top under a
 blistering salamander.

 The salamander is worth modernizing, too, so you can brand your
 own Rabbits with your monogram or the design of your own
 Rabbitry. Such a branding iron might be square, like the stew
 tin, and about the size of a piece of toast
</code></pre><p>It is notable that there is no beer or ale in this recipe, but not lamentable, since all aboriginal cheese toasts were washed down in tossing seas of ale, beer, porter, stout, and &#39;arf and &#39;arf.</p><p>This creamy Stewed Buck, on which the literary greats of Johnson&#39;s time supped while they smoked their church wardens, received its highest praise from an American newspaper woman who rhapsodized in 1891: &quot;Then came stewed cheese, on the thin shaving of crisp, golden toast in hot silver saucers--so hot that the cheese was the substance of thick cream, the flavor of purple pansies and red raspberries commingled.&quot;</p><p>This may seem a bit flowery, but in truth many fine cheeses hold a trace of the bouquet of the flowers that have enriched the milk.

 bottom of the ocean)_

 Shred, flake or mince a cupful of any freshly cooked or canned
 sea food and save some of the liquor, if any. Make according to
 Oyster Rabbit recipe above.

 Instead of using only one kind of sea food, try several, mixed
 according to taste. Spike this succulent Sea Rabbit with
 horseradish or a dollop of sherry, for a change.
</code></pre><p>&quot;Bouquet of the Sea&quot; Rabbit</p><pre><code> The seafaring Portuguese set the style for this lush bouquet of

 the chafing dish. They also accent it with tidbits of sea food as
 above.

 the whale, or cooked dried herring, finnan haddie, mackerel, cod,

 Happy combinations are hit upon in mixing leftovers of several
 kinds by the cupful. So the odd old cookbook direction, &quot;Add a
 cup of fish,&quot; takes on new meaning.
</code></pre><p>Grilled Sardine Rabbit</p><pre><code> Make a Basic Rabbit and pour it over sardines, skinned, boned,
 halved and grilled, on buttered toast.

 Similarly cooked fillets of any small fish will make as succulent
 a grilled Rabbit.
</code></pre><p>Roe Rabbits</p><pre><code> Slice cooked roe of shad or toothsome eggs of other fish, grill

 roe is esteemed the finest, there are many other sapid ones of
 salmon, herring, flounder, cod, etc.
</code></pre><p>Plain Sardine Rabbit</p><pre><code> Make Basic Rabbit with only 2 cups of cheese, and in place of the
 egg yolks and beer, stir in a large tin of sardines, skinned,

 chutney with the egg yolks and beer at the finish, spread toast
 thickly with anchovy paste and butter, and pour the Rabbit over.

 them are fine) on hot buttered toast and pour a Basic Rabbit over
 the fish.

 The best combination we ever tasted is made by laying a thin
 slice of smoked salmon over a thick one of smoked sturgeon.
</code></pre><p>Smoked Cheddar Rabbit</p><pre><code> With or without smoked fish, Rabbit-hunters whose palates crave
 the savor of a wisp of smoke go for a Basic Rabbit made with
 smoked Cheddar in place of the usual aged, but unsmoked, Cheddar.
 We use a two-year-old that Phil Alpert, Mr. Cheese himself,
 brings down from Canada and has specially smoked in the same
 savory room where sturgeon is getting the works. So his Cheddar
 absorbs the de luxe flavor of six-dollar-per-pound sturgeon and
 is sold for a fraction of that.

 And just in case you are fishing around for something extra
 special, serve this smoky Rabbit on oven-browned Bombay ducks,
 those crunchy flat toasts of East Indian fish.

 Or go Oriental by accompanying this with cups of smoky Lapsang
 Soochong China tea.

 When cooked smooth and creamy, stir in the egg to thicken the
 mixture and serve on toasted crackers, dry or buttered, for
 contrast with the bread.

 Some Rabbiteers monkey with this, lacing it with half a cup of
 catsup, making a sort of pink baboon out of what should be a
 white monkey.

 There is a cult for Crumby Rabbits variations on which extend all
 the way to a deep casserole dish called Baked Rabbit and
 consisting of alternate layers of stale bread crumbs and
 grated-cheese crumbs. This illegitimate three-layer Rabbit is
 moistened with eggs beaten up with milk, and seasoned with salt
 and paprika.

 with a little butter, prepared mustard, and a splash of beer.

 Have ready some slices of toast soaked in hot beer or ale and
 pour the Rabbit over them.

 The temperance version of this substitutes milk for beer and
 delicately soaks the toast in hot water instead.
</code></pre><p>Proof that there is no Anglo-Saxon influence here lies in the use of prepared mustard. The English, who still do a lot of things the hard way, mix their biting dry mustard fresh with water before every meal, while the Germans and French bottle theirs, as we do.</p><p>Pumpernickel Rabbit</p><pre><code> This German deviation is made exactly the same as the Dutch
 Rabbit above, but its ingredients are the opposite in color.
 Black bread (pumpernickel) slices are soaked in heated dark beer
 (porter or stout) and the yellow cheese melted in the skillet is
 also stirred up with brunette beer.
</code></pre><p>Since beer is a kind of liquid bread, it is natural for the two to commingle in Rabbits whether they are blond Dutch or black pumpernickel. And since cheese is only solid milk, and the Cheddar is noted for its beery smell, there is further affinity here. An old English proverb sums it up neatly: &quot;Bread and cheese are the two targets against death.&quot;</p><p>By the way, the word pumpernickel is said to have been coined when Napoleon tasted his first black bread in Germany. Contemptuously he spat it out with: &quot;This would be good for my horse, Nicole.&quot; &quot;<em>Bon pour Nicole</em>&quot; in French.</p><p>Gruyere Welsh Rabbit <em>au gratin</em></p><pre><code> Cut crusts from a half-dozen slices of bread.

 bread crumbs. Put in oven 10 minutes and rush to the ultimate
 consumer.

 wine and soup with the soda and all seasonings. Stir in cheese
 slowly until melted and finish off by thickening with the egg and

</code></pre><p>Although wine Rabbits, red or white, are as unusual as Swiss ones with Gruyere in place of Cheddar, wine is commonly drunk with anything from a Golden Buck to a Blushing Bunny. But for most of us, a deep draught of beer or ale goes best with an even deeper draught of the mellow scent of a Cheddar golden-yellow.</p><p>Savory Eggy Dry Rabbit</p><p>1/8 pound butter 2 cups grated Gruyere 4 eggs, well-beaten Salt Pepper Mustard</p><pre><code> Melt butter and cheese together with the beaten eggs, stirring
 steadily with wooden spoon until soft and smooth. Season and pour

Webster makes it seem no better than a collapsed souffle, with his definition:</p><pre><code> Fondue. Also, erroneously, _fondu_. A dish made of melted
 cheese, butter, eggs, and, often, milk and bread crumbs.
</code></pre><p>Thorndike-Barnhart further demotes this dish, that for centuries has been one of the world&#39;s greatest, to &quot;a combination of melted cheese, eggs and butter&quot; and explains that the name comes from the French <em>fondre</em>, meaning melt. The latest snub is delivered by the up-to-date <em>Cook&#39;s Quiz</em> compiled by TV culinary experts:</p><pre><code> A baked dish with eggs, cheese, butter, milk and bread crumbs.
</code></pre><p>A baked dish, indeed! Yet the Fondue has added to the gaiety and inebriety of nations, if not of dictionaries. It has commanded the respect of the culinary great. Savarin, Boulestin, Andre Simon, all have hailed its heavenly consistency, all have been regaled with its creamy, nay velvety, smoothness.</p><p>A touch of garlic, a dash of kirsch, fresh ground black pepper, nutmeg, black pearl truffles of Bugey, red cayenne pepper, the luscious gravy of roast turkey--such little matters help to make an authentic dunking Fondue, not a baked Fondue, mind you. Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin a century and a half ago brought the original &quot;receipt&quot; with him and spread it around with characteristic generosity during the two years of his exile in New York after the French Revolution. In his monumental <em>Physiologie du Gout</em> he records an incident that occurred in 1795:</p><pre><code> Whilst passing through Boston ... I taught the restaurant-keeper
 Julien to make a _Fondue_, or eggs cooked with cheese. This dish,
 a novelty to the Americans, became so much the rage, that he
 (Julien) felt himself obliged, by way of thanks, to send me to
 New York the rump of one of those pretty little roebucks that are
 brought from Canada in winter, and which was declared exquisite
 by the chosen committee whom I convoked for the occasion.
</code></pre><p>As the great French gourmet, Savarin was born on the Swiss border (at Belley, in the fertile Province of Bugey, where Gertrude Stein later had a summer home), he no doubt ate Gruyere three times a day, as is the custom in Switzerland and adjacent parts. He sets down the recipe just as he got it from its Swiss source, the papers of Monsieur Trolliet, in the neighboring Canton of Berne:</p><pre><code> Take as many eggs as you wish to use, according to the number of
 your guests. Then take a lump of good Gruyere cheese, weighing
 about a third of the eggs, and a nut of butter about half the
 weight of the cheese. (Since today&#39;s eggs in America weigh about
 1-1/2 ounces apiece, if you start the Fondue with 8. your lump
 of good Gruyere would come to 1/4 pound and your butter to 1/8
 pound.)

 Break and beat the eggs well in a flat pan, then add the butter
 and the cheese, grated or cut in small pieces.

 Place the pan on a good fire and stir with a wooden spoon until
 the mixture is fairly thick and soft; put in a little or no salt,
 according to the age of the cheese, and a good deal of pepper,
 for this is one of the special attributes of this ancient dish.

 Let it be placed on the table in a hot dish, and if some of the
 best wines be produced, and the bottle passed quite freely, a
 marvelous effect will be beheld.
</code></pre><p>This has long been quoted as the proper way to make the national dish of Switzerland. Savarin tells of hearing oldsters in his district laugh over the Bishop of Belley eating his Fondue with a spoon instead of the traditional fork, in the first decade of the 1700&#39;s. He tells, too, of a Fondue party he threw for a couple of his septuagenarian cousins in Paris &quot;about the year 1801.&quot;</p><p>The party was the result of much friendly taunting of the master: &quot;By Jove, Jean, you have been bragging for such a long time about your Fondues, you have continually made our mouths water. It is high time to put a stop to all this. We will come and breakfast with you some day and see what sort of thing this dish is.&quot;</p><p>Savarin invited them for ten o&#39;clock next day, started them off with the table laid on a &quot;snow white cloth, and in each one&#39;s place two dozen oysters with a bright golden lemon. At each end of the table stood a bottle of sauterne, carefully wiped, excepting the cork, which showed distinctly that it had been in the cellar for a long while.... After the oysters, which were quite fresh, came some broiled kidneys, a <em>terrine</em> of <em>foie gras</em>, a pie with truffles, and finally the Fondue. The different ingredients had all been assembled in a stewpan, which was placed on the table over a chafing dish, heated with spirits of wine.</p><p>&quot;Then,&quot; Savarin is quoted, &quot;I commenced operations on the field of battle, and my cousins did not lose a single one of my movements. They were loud in the praise of this preparation, and asked me to let them have the receipt, which I promised them....&quot;</p><p>This Fondue breakfast party that gave the nineteenth century such a good start was polished off with &quot;fruits in season and sweets, a cup of genuine mocha, ... and finally two sorts of liqueurs, one a spirit for cleansing, and the other an oil for softening.&quot;</p><p>This primitive Swiss Cheese Fondue is now prepared more elaborately in what is called:</p><p>Neufchatel Style</p><p>2-1/2 cups grated imported Swiss 1-1/2 tablespoons flour 1 clove of garlic 1 cup dry white wine Crusty French &quot;flute&quot; or hard rolls cut into big mouthfuls, handy for dunking 1 jigger kirsch Salt Pepper Nutmeg</p><pre><code> The cheese should be shredded or grated coarsely and mixed well
 with the flour. Use a chafing dish for cooking and a small heated
 casserole for serving. Hub the bottom and sides of the blazer
 well with garlic, pour in the wine and heat to bubbling, just
 under boiling. Add cheese slowly, half a cup at a time, and stir
 steadily in one direction only, as in making Welsh Rabbit. Use a
 silver fork. Season with very little salt, always depending on
 how salty the cheese is, but use plenty of black pepper, freshly
 ground, and a touch of nutmeg. Then pour in the kirsch, stir
 steadily and invite guests to dunk their forked bread in the dish
 or in a smaller preheated casserole over a low electric or
 alcohol burner on the dining table. The trick is to keep the
 bubbling melted cheese in rhythmic motion with the fork, both up
 and down and around and around.
</code></pre><p>The dunkers stab the hunks of crusty French bread through the soft part to secure a firm hold in the crust, for if your bread comes off in dunking you pay a forfeit, often a bottle of wine.</p><p>The dunking is done as rhythmically as the stirring, guests taking regular turns at twirling the fork to keep the cheese swirling. When this &quot;chafing dish cheese custard,&quot; as it has been called in England, is ready for eating, each in turn thrusts in his fork, sops up a mouthful with the bread for a sponge and gives the Fondue a final stir, to keep it always moving in the same direction. All the while the heat beneath the dish keeps it gently bubbling.</p><p>Such a Neufchatel party was a favorite of King Edward VII, especially when he was stepping out as the Prince of Wales. He was as fond of Fondue as most of the great gourmets of his day and preferred it to Welsh Rabbit, perhaps because of the wine and kirsch that went into it.</p><p>At such a party a little heated wine is added if the Fondue gets too thick. When finally it has cooked down to a crust in the bottom of the dish, this is forked out by the host and divided among the guests as a very special dividend.</p><p>Any dry white wine will serve in a pinch, and the Switzerland Cheese Association, in broadcasting this classical recipe, points out that any dry rum, slivovitz, or brandy, including applejack, will be a valid substitute for the kirsch. To us, applejack seems specially suited, when we stop to consider our native taste that has married apple pie to cheese since pioneer times.</p><p>In culinary usage fondue means &quot;melting to an edible consistency&quot; and this, of course, doesn&#39;t refer to cheese alone, although we use it chiefly for that.</p><p>In France Fondue is also the common name for a simple dish of eggs scrambled with grated cheese and butter and served very hot on toasted bread, or filled into fancy paper cases, quickly browned on top and served at once. The reason for this is that all baked Fondues fall as easily and as far as Souffles, although the latter are more noted for this failing. There is a similarity in the soft fluffiness of both, although the Fondues are always more moist. For there is a stiff, stuffed-shirt buildup around any Souffle, suggesting a dressy dinner, while Fondue started as a self-service dunking bowl.</p><p>Our modern tendency is to try to make over the original French Fondue on the Welsh Rabbit model--to turn it into a sort of French Rabbit. Although we know that both Gruyere and Emmentaler are what we call Swiss and that it is impossible in America to duplicate the rich Alpine flavor given by the mountain herbs, we are inclined to try all sorts of domestic cheeses and mixtures thereof. But it&#39;s best to stick to Savarin&#39;s &quot;lump of Gruyere&quot; just as the neighboring French and Italians do. It is interesting to note that this Swiss Alpine cooking has become so international that it is credited to Italy in the following description we reprint from <em>When Madame Cooks</em>, by an Englishman, Eric Weir:</p><p>Fondue a l&#39;Italienne</p><pre><code> This is one of those egg dishes that makes one feel really
 grateful to hens. From its name it originated probably in Italy,
 but it has crossed the Alps. I have often met it in France, but
 only once in Italy.

 First of all, make a very stiff white sauce with butter, flour
 and milk. The sauce should be stiff enough to allow the wooden
 spoon to stand upright or almost.

 Off the fire, add yolks of eggs and 4 ounces of grated Gruyere
 cheese. Mix this in well with the white sauce and season with
 salt, pepper and some grated nutmeg. Beat whites of egg firm. Add
 the whites to the preparation, stir in, and pour into a pudding
 basin.

 Take a large saucepan and fill half full of water. Bring to a
 boil, and then place the pudding basin so that the top of the
 basin is well out of the water. Allow to boil gently for 1-1/2 to
 2 hours. Renew the boiling water from time to time, as it
 evaporates, and take care that the water, in boiling, does not
 bubble over the mixture.

 Test with a knife, as for a cake, to see if it is cooked. When
 the knife comes out clean, take the basin out of the water and
 turn the Fondue out on a dish. It should be fairly firm and keep
 the shape of the basin.

 Sprinkle with some finely chopped ham and serve hot.
</code></pre><p>The imported Swiss sometimes is cubed instead of grated, then marinated for four or five hours in dry white wine, before being melted and liquored with the schnapps. This can be pleasantly adopted here in:</p><p>All-American Fondue</p><p>1 pound imported Swiss cheese, cubed 3/4 cup scuppernong or other American white wine 1-1/2 jiggers applejack</p><pre><code> After marinating the Swiss cubes in the wine, simply melt
 together over hot water, stir until soft and creamy, add the
 applejack and dunk with fingers of toast or your own to a chorus
 of &quot;All Bound Round with a Woolen String.&quot;

 Of course, this can be treated as a mere vinous Welsh Rabbit and
 poured over toast, to be accompanied by beer. But wine is the
 thing, for the French Fondue is to dry wine what the Rabbit is to
 stale ale or fresh beer.
</code></pre><p>We say French instead of Swiss because the French took over the dish so eagerly, together with the great Gruyere that makes it distinctive. They internationalized it, sent it around the world with bouillabaisse and onion soup, that celestial <em>soupe a l&#39;oignon</em> on which snowy showers of grated Gruyere descend.</p><p>To put the Welsh Rabbit in its place they called it Fondue a l&#39;Anglaise, which also points up the twinlike relationship of the world&#39;s two favorite dishes of melted cheese. But to differentiate and show they are not identical twins, the No. 1 dish remained Fromage Fondue while the second was baptized Fromage Fondue a la Biere.</p><p>Beginning with Savarin the French whisked up more rapturous, rhapsodic writing about Gruyere and its offspring, the Fondue, together with the puffed Souffle, than about any other imported cheese except Parmesan.</p><p>Parmesan and Gruyere were praised as the two greatest culinary cheeses. A variant Fondue was made of the Italian cheese.</p><p>Parmesan Fondue</p><p>3 tablespoons butter 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese 4 eggs, lightly beaten Salt Pepper</p><pre><code> Over boiling water melt butter and cheese slowly, stir in the
 eggs, season to taste and stir steadily in one direction only,
 until smooth.

 Pour over fingers of buttered toast. Or spoon it up, as the
 ancients did, before there were any forks. It&#39;s beaten with a
 fork but eaten catch-as-catch-can, like chicken-in-the-rough.
</code></pre><p>Sapsago Swiss Fondue</p><p>2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1-1/2 cups milk 2-1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese 2-1/2 tablespoons grated Sapsago 1/2 cup dry white wine Pepper, black and red, freshly ground Fingers of toast</p><pre><code> Over boiling water stir the first four ingredients into a smooth,
 fairly thick cream sauce. Then stir in Swiss cheese until well
 melted. After that add the Sapsago, finely grated, and wine in
 small splashes. Stir steadily, in one direction only, until
 velvety. Season sharply with the contrasting peppers and serve
 over fingers of toast.
</code></pre><p>This is also nice when served bubbling in individual, preheated pastry shells, casseroles or ramekins, although this way most of the fun of the dunking party is left out. To make up for it, however, cooked slices of mushrooms are sometimes added.</p><p>At the Cheese Cellar in the New York World&#39;s Fair Swiss Pavilion, where a continual dunking party was in progress, thousands of amateurs learned such basic things as not to overcook the Fondue lest it become stringy, and the protocol of dunking in turn and keeping the mass in continual motion until the next on the Fondue line dips in his cube of bread. The success of the dish depends on making it quickly, keeping it gently a-bubble and never letting it stand still for a split second.</p><p>The Swiss, who consume three or four times as much cheese per capita as we, and almost twice as much as the French, are willing to share Fondue honors with the French Alpine province of Savoy, a natural cheese cellar with almost two dozen distinctive types of its very own, such as Fat cheese, also called Death&#39;s Head; La Grande Bornand, a luscious half-dried sheep&#39;s milker; Chevrotins, small, dry goat milk cheeses; and Le Vacherin. The latter, made in both Savoy and Switzerland, boasts two interesting variants:</p><pre><code> 1. _Vacherin Fondue or Spiced Fondue:_ Made about the same as
 Emmentaler, ripened to sharp age, and then melted, spices added
 and the cheese re-formed. It is also called Spiced Fondue and
 sells for about two dollars a pound. Named Fondue from being
 melted, though it&#39;s really recooked,

 2. _Vacherin a la Main:_ This is a curiosity in cheeses,
 resembling a cold, uncooked Fondue. Made of cow&#39;s milk, it is
 round, a foot in diameter and half a foot high. It is salted and
 aged until the rind is hard and the inside more runny than the
 ripest Camembert, so it can be eaten with a spoon (like the
 cooked Fondue) as well as spread on bread. The local name for it
 is _Tome de Montagne_.
</code></pre><p>Here is a good assortment of Fondues:</p><p>Vacherin-Fribourg Fondue</p><p>2 tablespoons butter 1 clove garlic, crushed 2 cups shredded Vacherin cheese 2 tablespoons hot water</p><pre><code> This authentic quickie is started by cooking the garlic in butter
 until the butter is melted. Then remove garlic and reduce heat.
 Add the soft cheese and stir with silver fork until smooth and
 velvety. Add the water in little splashes, stirring constantly in
 one direction. Dunk! (In this melted Swiss a little water takes
 the place of a lot of wine.)
</code></pre><p>La Fondue Comtois</p><pre><code> This regional specialty of Franche-Comte is made with white wine.
 Sauterne, Chablis, Riesling or any Rhenish type will serve
 splendidly. Also use butter, grated Gruyere, beaten eggs and that
 touch of garlic.
</code></pre><p>Chives Fondue</p><p>3 cups grated Swiss cheese 3 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons butter 1 garlic clove, crushed 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives 1 cup dry white wine Salt Freshly ground pepper A pinch of nutmeg 1/4 cup kirsch</p><pre><code> Mix cheese and flour. Melt butter in chafing-dish blazer rubbed
 with garlic. Cook chives in butter 1 minute. Add wine and heat
 just under boiling. Keep simmering as you add cheese-and-flour
 mix gradually, stirring always in one direction. Salt according
 to age and sharpness of cheese; add plenty of freshly ground
 pepper and the pinch of nutmeg.

 When everything is stirred smooth and bubbling, toss in the
 kirsch without missing a stroke of the fork and get to dunking.

 Large, crisp, hot potato chips make a pleasant change for dunking
 purposes. Or try assorted crackers alternating with the absorbent
 bread, or hard rolls.
</code></pre><p>Tomato Fondue</p><p>2 tomatoes, skinned, seeded and chopped 1/2 teaspoon dried sweet basil 1 clove garlic 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 cups grated Cheddar cheese Paprika</p><pre><code> Mix basil with chopped tomatoes. Rub chafing dish with garlic,
 melt butter, add tomatoes and much paprika. Cook 5 to 6 minutes,
 add wine, stir steadily to boiling point. Then add cheese, half a
 cup at a time, and keep stirring until everything is smooth.

 Serve on hot toast, like Welsh Rabbit.
</code></pre><p>Here the two most popular melted-cheese dishes tangle, but they&#39;re held together with the common ingredient, tomato.</p><p>Fondue also appears as a sauce to pour over baked tomatoes. Stale bread crumbs are soaked in tomato juice to make:</p><p>Tomato Baked Fondue</p><p>1 cup tomato juice 1 cup stale bread crumbs 1 cup grated sharp American cheese 1 tablespoon melted butter Salt 4 eggs, separated and well beaten</p><pre><code> Soak crumbs in tomato juice, stir cheese in butter until melted,
 season with a little or no salt, depending on saltiness of the
 cheese. Mix in the beaten yolks, fold in the white and bake
 about 50 minutes in moderate oven.
</code></pre><p>BAKED FONDUES</p><p>Although Savarin&#39;s dunking Fondue was first to make a sensation on these shores and is still in highest esteem among epicures, the Fondue America took to its bosom was baked. The original recipe came from the super-caseous province of Savoy under the explicit title, <em>La Fondue au Fromage</em>.</p><p>La Fondue au Fromage</p><pre><code> Make the usual creamy mixture of butter, flour, milk, yolks of
 eggs and Gruyere, in thin slices for a change. Use red pepper
 instead of black, splash in a jigger of kirsch but no white wine.
 Finally fold in the egg whites and bake in a mold for 45 minutes.
</code></pre><p>We adapted this to our national taste which had already based the whole business of melted cheese on the Welsh Rabbit with stale ale or milk instead of white wine and Worcestershire, mustard and hot peppers. Today we have come up with this:</p><p>100% American Fondue</p><p>2 cups scalded milk 2 cups stale bread crumbs 1/2 teaspoon dry English mustard Salt Dash of nutmeg Dash of pepper 2 cups American cheese (Cheddar) 2 egg yolks, well beaten 2 egg whites, beaten stiff</p><pre><code> Soak crumbs in milk, season and stir in the cheese until melted.
 Add the beaten egg yolks and stir until you have a smooth
 mixture. Let this cool while beating the whites stiff, leaving
 them slightly moist. Fold the whites into the cool, custardy mix
 and bake in a buttered dish until firm. (About 50 minutes in a
 moderate oven.)
</code></pre><p>This is more of a baked cheese job than a true Fondue, to our way of thinking, and the scalded milk doesn&#39;t exactly take the place of the wine or kirsch. It is characteristic of our bland cookery.</p><p>OTHER FONDUES PLAIN AND FANCY, BAKED AND NOT</p><p>Quickie Catsup Tummy Fondiddy</p><p>3/4 pound sharp cheese, diced 1 can condensed tomato soup 1/2 cup catsup 1/2 teaspoon mustard 1 egg, lightly beaten</p><pre><code> In double boiler melt cheese in soup.

The <em>English Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery</em>, the oldest, biggest and best of such works in English, lumps Cheese Puffs and Ramekins together, giving the same recipes for both, although it treats each extensively under its own name when not made with cheese.</p><p>Cheese was the basis of the original French Ramequin, cheese and bread crumbs or puff paste, baked in a mold, (with puff again the principal factor in Souffle, from the French <em>souffler</em>, puff up).</p><p>Basic Souffle</p><p>3 tablespoons butter or margarine 4 tablespoons flour 1-1/4 cups hot milk, scalded 1 teaspoon salt A dash of cayenne 1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese, sharp 2 egg yolks, beaten lemon-yellow 2 egg whites, beaten stiff</p><pre><code> Melt butter, stir in flour and milk gradually until thick and
 smooth. Season and add the cheese, continuing the cooking and
 slow stirring until velvety. Remove from heat and let cool
 somewhat; then stir in the egg yolks with a light hand and an
 upward motion. Fold in the stiff whites and when evenly mixed
 pour into a big, round baking dish. (Some butter it and some
 don&#39;t.) To make sure the top will be even when baked, run a spoon
 or knife around the surface, about 1 inch from the edge of the
 dish, before baking slowly in a moderate oven until puffed high
 and beautifully browned. Serve instantly for fear the Souffle may
 fall. The baking takes up to an hour and the egg whites shouldn&#39;t
 be beaten so stiff they are hard to fold in and contain no air to
 expand and puff up the dish.
</code></pre><p>To perk up the seasonings, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, nutmeg and even garlic are often used to taste, especially in England.</p><p>While Cheddar is the preferred cheese, Parmesan runs it a close second. Then comes Swiss. You may use any two or all three of these together. Sometimes Roquefort is added, as in the Ramekin recipes below.</p><p>Parmesan Souffle</p><pre><code> Make the same as Basic Souffle, with these small modifications in

 and well puffed. Serve instantly.

 Variations of this popular Souffle leave out the onion and
 simplify matters by using 2 cups of mashed potatoes. Sometimes 1
 tablespoon of catsup and another of minced parsley is added to
 the mixture. Or onion juice alone, to take the place of the
 cooked onions--about a tablespoon, full or scant.
</code></pre><p>The English, in concocting such a Potato Puff or Souffle, are inclined to make it extra peppery, as they do most of their Cheese Souffles, with not only &quot;a dust of black pepper&quot; but &quot;as much cayenne as may be stood on the face of a sixpence.&quot;</p><p>Cheese Fritter Souffles</p><pre><code> These combine ham with Parmesan cheese and are even more

 ramekins, tiny tins, cups, or any sort of little mold of any
 shape. Bake in hot oven about 10 minutes, until richly browned.
</code></pre><p>Such miniature Souffles serve as liaison officers for this entire section, since they are baked in ramekins, or ramequins, from the French word for the small baking dish that holds only one portion. These may be paper boxes, usually round, earthenware, china, Pyrex, of any attractive shape in which to bake or serve the Puffs.</p><p>More commonly, in America at least, Puffs are made without ramekin dishes, as follows:</p><p>Fried Puffs</p><p>2 egg whites, beaten stiff 1/2 cup grated cheese 1 tablespoon flour Salt Paprika</p><pre><code> Into the stiff egg whites fold the cheese, flour and seasonings.

 bake 15 minutes in slow oven.
</code></pre><p>The constant repetition of &quot;beaten stiff&quot; in these recipes may give the impression that the whites are badly beaten up, but such is not the case. They are simply whipped to peaks and left moist and glistening as a teardrop, with a slight sad droop to them that shows there is still room for the air to expand and puff things up in cooking.</p><p>Parmesan Puffs</p><pre><code> Make a spread of mayonnaise or other salad dressing with equal
 parts of imported Parmesan, grated fine. Spread on a score or
 more of crackers in a roomy pan and broil a couple of minutes
 till they puff up golden-brown.

 from Argentina where the rich pampas grass and Italian settlers
 get together on excellent Parmesan and Romano. Never buy Parmesan

Essentially a Cheese Puff, this is also <em>au gratin</em> when topped with both cheese and browned bread crumbs. By a sort of poetic cook&#39;s license the name is also applied to any kind of cake containing cheese and cooked in the identifying one-portion ramekin. It is used chiefly in the plural, however, together with the name of the chief ingredient, such as &quot;Chicken Ramekins&quot; and:</p><p>Cheese Ramekins I</p><p>2 eggs 2 tablespoons flour 1/8 pound butter, melted 1/8 pound grated cheese</p><pre><code> Mix well and bake in individual molds for 15 minutes.

 milk and add. Stir to a smooth batter and bake in buttered
 ramekins, standing in water, in moderate oven. Serve piping hot,

 out of them quickly; then they will sink and be inedible.
</code></pre><p>TWO ANCIENT ENGLISH RECIPES, STILL GOING STRONG</p><p>Cheese Ramekins III</p><pre><code> Grate 1/2 pound of any dry, rich cheese. Butter a dozen small
 paper cases, or little boxes of stiff writing paper like Souffle
 cases. Put a saucepan containing 1/2 pint of water over the fire,
 add 2 tablespoons of butter, and when the water boils, stir in 1
 heaping tablespoonful of flour. Beat the mixture until it shrinks
 away from the sides of the saucepan; then stir in the grated
 cheese. Remove the paste thus made from the fire, and let it
 partly cool. In the meantime separate the yolks from the whites
 of three eggs, and beat them until the yolks foam and the whites
 make a stiff froth. Put the mixture at once into the buttered
 paper cases, only half-filling them (since they rise very high
 while being baked) with small slices of cheese, and bake in a
 moderate oven for about 15 minutes. As soon as the Puffs are
 done, put the cases on a hot dish covered with a folded napkin,
 and serve very hot.
</code></pre><p>The most popular cheese for Ramekins has always been, and still is, Gruyere. But because the early English also adopted Italian Parmesan, that followed as a close second, and remains there today.</p><p>Sharp Cheddar makes tangy Ramekins, as will be seen in this second oldster; for though it prescribes Gloucester and Cheshire &quot;&#39;arf-and-&#39;arf,&quot; both are essentially Cheddars. Gloucester has been called &quot;a glorified Cheshire&quot; and the latter has long been known as a peculiarly rich and colorful elder brother of Cheddar, described in Kenelme Digby&#39;s <em>Closet Open&#39;d</em> as a &quot;quick, fat, rich, well-tasted cheese.&quot;</p><p>Cheese Ramekins IV</p><pre><code> Scrape fine 1/4 pound of Gloucester cheese and 1/4 pound of

 yolks of 4 eggs, 1/4 pound of fresh butter, and the crumbs of a
 French roll boiled in cream until soft. When all this is well
 mixed and pounded to a paste, add the beaten whites of 4 eggs.
 Should the paste seem too stiff, 1 or 2 tablespoons of sherry may
 be added. Put the paste into paper cases, and bake in a Dutch
 oven till nicely browned. The Ramekins should be served very hot.
</code></pre><p>Since both Gloucester cheese and Cheshire cheese are not easily come by even in London today, it would be hard to reproduce this in the States. So the best we can suggest is to use half-and-half of two of our own great Cheddars, say half-Coon and half-Wisconsin Longhorn, or half-Tillamook and half-Herkimer County. For there&#39;s no doubt about it, contrasting cheeses tickle the taste buds, and as many as three different kinds put together make Puffs all the more perfect.</p><p>Ramequins a la Parisienne</p><p>2 cups milk 1 cup cream 1 ounce salt butter 1 tablespoon flour 1/2 cup grated Gruyere Coarsely ground pepper An atom of nutmeg A <em>soupcon</em> of garlic A light touch of powdered sugar 8 eggs, separated</p><pre><code> Boil milk and cream together. Melt butter, mix in the flour and
 stir over heat 5 minutes, adding the milk and cream mixture a
 little at a time. When thoroughly cooked, remove from heat and
 stir in cheese, seasonings and the yolks of all 8 eggs, well
 beaten, and the whites of 2 even better beaten. When well mixed,
 fold in the remaining egg whites, stiffly beaten, until you have
 a batter as smooth and thick as cream. Pour this into ramekins of
 paper, porcelain or earthenware, filling each about 2/3 full to
 allow for them to puff up as they bake in a very slow oven until
 golden-brown (or a little less than 20 minutes).

 porridge of water, butter, seasoning, chopped garlic and toast;
 thickened with minced Gruyere and served very hot.&quot;
</code></pre><p>Several French provinces are known for distinctive individual Puffs usually served in the dainty fluted forms they are cooked in. In Jeanne d&#39;Arc&#39;s Lorraine, for instance, there are the simply named <em>Les Ramequins</em>, made of flour, Gruyere and eggs.</p><p>Swiss-Roquefort Ramekins</p><p>1/4 pound Swiss cheese 1/4 pound Roquefort cheese 1/2 pound butter 8 eggs, separated 4 breakfast rolls, crusts removed 1/2 cup cream</p><pre><code> The batter is made in the usual way, with the soft insides of the
 rolls simmered in the cream and stirred in. The egg whites are
 folded in last, as always, the batter poured into ramekins part
 full and baked to a golden-brown. Then they are served
 instantaneously, lest they fall.
</code></pre><p>Puff Paste Ramekins</p><pre><code> Puff or other pastry is rolled out fiat and sprinkled with fine
 tasty cheese or any cheese mixture, such as Parmesan with Gruyere
 and/or Swiss Sapsago for a piquant change, but in lesser quantity
 than the other cheeses used. Parmesan cheese has long been the
 favorite for these.

 Fold paste into 3 layers, roll out again and dust with more
 cheese. Fold once more and roll this out and cut in small fancy
 shapes to bake 10 to 15 minutes in a hot oven. Brushing with egg
 yolk before baking makes these Ramekins shine.
</code></pre><p>Frying Pan Ramekins</p><pre><code> Melt 2 ounces of butter, let it cool a little and then mix with
 1/2 pound of cheese. Fold in the whites of 3 eggs, beaten stiff
 but not dry. Cover frying pan with buttered papers, put slices of
 bread on this and cover with the cheese mixture. Cook about 5
 minutes, take it off and brown it with a salamander.
</code></pre><p>There are two schools of salamandering among turophiles. One holds that it toughens the cheese and makes it less digestible; the other that it&#39;s simply swell. Some of the latter addicts have special cheese-branding irons made with their monograms, to identify their creations, whether they be burned on the skins of Welsh Rabbits or Frying Pan Ramekins. Salamandering with an iron that has a gay, carnivalesque design can make a sort of harlequin Ramekin.</p><p>Casserole Ramekin</p><pre><code> Here is the Americanization of a French original: In a deep
 casserole lay alternate slices of white bread and Swiss cheese,
 with the cheese slices a bit bigger all around. Beat 2 eggs with
 2 cups of milk, season with salt and--of all things--nutmeg!
 Proceed to bake like individual Ramekins.

</code></pre><p>Little Hats, Cappelletti</p><pre><code> Freshly made and still moist Cappelletti, little hats, contrived
 out of tasty paste, may be had in any Little Italy macaroni shop.
 These may be stuffed sensationally in four different flavors
 with only two cheeses.

 Brown slices of chicken and ham separately, in butter. Mince each
 very fine and divide in half, to make four mixtures in equal
 amounts. Season these with salt, pepper and nutmeg and a binding
 of 2 parts egg yolk to I part egg white.

 With these meat mixtures you can make four different-flavored
 fillings:

 Ham and Mozzarella Chicken and Mozzarella Ham and Ricotta Chicken
 and Ricotta

 Fill the little hats alternately, so you&#39;ll have the same number
 of each different kind. Pinch edges tight together to keep the
 stuffings in while boiling fast for 5 minutes in chicken broth
 (or salted water, if you must).

 Since these Cappelletti are only a pleasing form and shape of
 ravioli, they are served in the same way on hot plates, with
 plain tomato sauce and Parmesan or reasonable substitute. If we
 count this final seasoning as an ingredient, this makes three
 cheeses, so that each of half a dozen taste buds can be getting
 individual sensations without letting the others know what it&#39;s
 doing.

 you can go as far as you like with varied layers of melting
 cheeses alternating with asparagus, until you come to the top,
 where you add two more kinds of cheese, a mixture of powdered
 Parmesan with Sapsago to give the new-mown hay scent.
</code></pre><p>Garlic on Cheese</p><pre><code> For one sandwich prepare 30 or 40 garlic cloves by removing skins
 and frying out the fierce pungence in smoking olive oil. They
 skip in the hot pan like Mexican jumping beans. Toast one side of
 a thickish slice of bread, put this side down on a grilling pan,
 cover it with a slice of imported Swiss Emmentaler or Gruyere, of
 about the same size, shape and thickness. Stick the cooked garlic
 cloves, while still blistering hot, in a close pattern into the
 cheese and brown for a minute under the grill. Salt lightly and
 dash with paprika for the color. (Recipe by Bob Brown in Merle
 Armitage&#39;s collection _Fit for a King_.)
</code></pre><p>Spaniards call garlic cloves teeth, Englishmen call them toes. It was cheese and garlic together that inspired Shakespeare to Hotspur&#39;s declaration in <em>King Henry IV</em>:</p><pre><code>I had rather live

Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
In any summer-house in Christendom.
</code></pre><p>Some people can take a mere <em>soupcon</em> of the stuff, while others can down it by the soup spoon, so we feel it necessary in reprinting our recipe to point to the warning of another early English writer: &quot;Garlic is very dangerous to young children, fine women and hot young men.&quot;</p><p>Blintzes</p><pre><code> This snow white member of the crepes suzette sorority is the most
 popular deb in New York&#39;s fancy cheese dishes set. Almost unknown

 cloth, with the cooked side down. While these are cooling make
 the blintz-filling by beating together the second egg, cottage

 blintzes, and perhaps the first, of them to be made was
 vatroushki, a variant of the blintzes above. The chief
 difference is that rounds of puff paste dough are used instead of
 the hot cakes, 1 teaspoon of sugar is added to the cottage cheese
 filling, and the sour cream, 1/2 cup, is mixed into this instead
 of being served with it. Little cups filled with this mix are
 made by pinching the edges of the dough together. The tops are
 brushed with egg yolk and baked in a brisk oven.

And fruit of trees,
Supply that want
With butter and cheese.

Thomas Tusser in
_The Last Remedy_
</code></pre><p>Butter and cheese are mixed together in equal parts for cheese butter. Serbia has a cheese called Butter that more or less matches Turkey&#39;s Durak, of which butter is an indispensable ingredient, and French Cancoillote is based on sour milk simmered with butter.</p><p>The English have a cheese called Margarine, made with the butter substitute. In Westphalia there are no two schools of thought about whether &#39;tis better to eat butter with cheese or not, for in Westphalia sour-milk cheese, butter is mixed in as part of the process of making. The Arabs press curds and butter together to store in vats, and the Scots have Crowdie or Cruddy Butter.</p><p>BUTTERMILK CHEESE</p><p>The value of buttermilk is stressed in an extravagant old Hindu proverb: &quot;A man may live without bread, but without buttermilk he dies.&quot;</p><p>Cheese was made before butter, being the earliest form of dairy manufacturing, so buttermilk cheese came well after plain milk cheese, even after whey cheese. It is very tasty, and a natural with potato salad. The curd is salted after draining and sold in small parchment packages.</p><p>German &quot;leather&quot; cheese has buttermilk mixed with the plain. The Danes make their Appetitost with sour buttermilk. Ricotta Romano, for a novelty, is made of sheep buttermilk.</p><p>COTTAGE CHEESE</p><p>In America cottage cheese is also called pot, Dutch and smearcase. It is the easiest and quickest to make of all cheeses, by simply letting milk sour, or adding buttermilk to curdle it, then stand a while on the back of the kitchen stove, since it is homemade as a rule. It is drained in a bag of cheesecloth and may be eaten the same day, usually salted.</p><p>The Pilgrims brought along the following two tried and true recipes from olde England, and both are still in use and good repute:</p><p><em>Cottage Cheese No. 1</em></p><p>Let milk sour until clotted. Pour boiling water over and it will immediately curd. Stir well and pour into a colander. Pour a little cold water on the curd, salt it and break it up attractively for serving.</p><p><em>Cottage Cheese No. 2</em></p><p>A very rich and tasty variety is made of equal parts whole milk and buttermilk heated together to just under the boiling point. Pour into a linen bag and let drain until next day. Then remove, salt to taste and add a bit of butter or cream to make a smooth, creamy consistency, and pat into balls the size of a Seville orange.</p><p>CREAM CHEESE</p><p>In England there are three distinct manners of making cream cheese:</p><ol><li>Fresh milk strained and lightly drained.</li><li>Scalded cream dried and drained dry, like Devonshire.</li><li>Rennet curd ripened, with thin, edible rind, or none, packaged in small blocks or miniature bricks by dairy companies, as in the U.S. Philadelphia Cream cheese.</li></ol><p>American cream cheeses follow the English pattern, being named from then: region or established brands owned by Breakstone, Borden, Kraft, Shefford, etc.</p><p>Cream cheese such as the first listed above is easier to make than cottage cheese or any other. Technically, in fact, it is not a cheese but the dried curd of milk and is often called virginal. Fresh milk is simply strained through muslin in a perforated box through which the whey and extra moisture drains away for three or four days, leaving a residue as firm as fresh butter.</p><p>In America, where we mix cream cheese with everything, a popular assortment of twelve sold in New York bears these ingredients and names: Chives, Cherry, Garden, Caviar, Lachs, Pimiento, Olive and Pimiento, Pineapple, Relish, Scallion, Strawberry, and Triple Decker of Relish, Pimiento and Cream in layers.</p><p>In Italy there is Stracchino Cream, in Sweden Chantilly. Finally, to come to France, la Foncee or Fromage de Pau, a cream also known around the world as Creme d&#39;Isigny, Double Creme, Fromage a la Creme de Gien, Pots de Creme St. Gervais, etc. etc.</p><p>The French go even farther by eating thick fresh cream with Chevretons du Beaujolais and Fromage Blanc in the style that adds <em>a la creme</em> to their already glorified names.</p><p>The English came along with Snow Cream Cheese that is more of a dessert, similar to Italian Cream Cheese.</p><p>We&#39;d like to have a cheese ice cream to contrast with too sweet ones. Attempts at this have been made, both here and in England; Scottish Caledonian cream came closest. We have frozen cheese with fruit, to be sure, but no true cheese ice cream as yet, though some cream cheeses seem especially suitable.</p><pre><code>The farmer&#39;s daughter hath soft brown hair
(Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese)
And I met with a ballad I can&#39;t say where,
That wholly consisted of lines like these,
(Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese.)
</code></pre><p>In this parody by Calverly, &quot;The Farmer&#39;s Daughter,&quot; the ingredients suggest cheese cake, dating back to 1381 In England. From that year Kettner in his <em>Book of the Table</em> quotes this recipe:</p><pre><code> Take cream of almonds or of cow milk and beat them well together;
 and make small coffins (that is, cases of pastry), and do it (put
 it) therein; and do (put) thereto sugar and good powders. Or take
 good fat cheese and eggs and make them of divers colours, green,
 red or yellow, and bake them or serve them forth.
</code></pre><p>This primitive &quot;receipt&quot; grew up into Richmond maids of honor that caused Kettner to wax poetic with:</p><pre><code> At Richmond we are permitted to touch with our lips a countless
 number of these maids--light and airy as the &quot;airy, fairy
 Lilian.&quot; What more can the finest poetry achieve in quickening
 the things of earth into tokens and foretastes of heaven, with
 glimpses of higher life and ethereal worlds.
</code></pre><p>CHEESECAKES</p><p><em>Coronation Cheese Cake</em></p><p>The <em>Oxford Dictionary</em> defines cheese cake as a &quot;tartlet filled with sweet curds, etc.&quot; This shows that the cheese is the main thing, and the and-so-forth just a matter of taste. We are delighted to record that the Lord Mayor of London picked traditional cheese tarts, the maids of honor mentioned earlier in this section, as the Coronation dessert with which to regale the second Queen Elizabeth at the city luncheon in Guildhall This is most fitting, since these tarts were named after the maids of honor at the court of the first Queen Elizabeth. The original recipe is said to have sold for a thousand pounds. These Richmond maids of honor had the usual cheese cake ingredients: butter and eggs and pounds of cheese, but what made the subtle flavor: nutmeg, brandy, lemon, orange-flower water, or all four?</p><p>More than 2,000 years before this land of Coronation cheese cake, the Greeks had a word for it--several in fact: Apician Cheese Cake, Aristoxenean, and Philoxenean among them. Then the Romans took it over and we read from an epistle of the period:</p><pre><code> Thirty times in this one year, Charinus, while you have been
 arranging to make your will, have I sent you cheese cakes
 dripping with Hyblaean Thyme. (Celestial honey, such as that of
 Mount Hymettus we still get from Greece.)
</code></pre><p>Plato mentioned cheese cake, and a town near Thebes was named for it before Christ was born, at a time when cheese cakes were widely known as &quot;dainty food for mortal man.&quot;</p><p>Today cheese cakes come in a half dozen popular styles, of which the ones flavored with fresh pineapple are the most popular in New York. But buyers delight in every sort, including the one hundred percent American type called cheese pies.</p><p>Indeed, there seems to be no dividing line between cheese cakes and cheese pies. While most of them are sweet, some are made piquant with pimientos and olives. We offer a favorite of ours made from popcorn-style pot cheese put through a sieve:</p><p>Pineapple Cheese Cake</p><p>2-1/2 pounds sieved pot cheese 1-inch piece vanilla bean 1/4 pound sweet butter, melted 1/2 small box graham crackers, crushed fine 4 eggs 2 cups sugar 1 small can crushed pineapple, drained 2 cups milk 1/3 cup flour</p><pre><code> In a big bowl mix everything except the graham crackers and
 pineapple in the order given above. Butter a square Pyrex pan and
 put in the graham-cracker dust to make a crust. Cover this evenly
 with the pineapple and pour in the cheese-custard mixture. Bake I
 hour in a &quot;quiet&quot; oven, as the English used to say for a moderate
 one, and when done set aside for 12 hours before eating.
</code></pre><p>Because of the time and labor involved maybe you had better buy your cheese cakes, even though some of the truly fine ones cost a dime a bite, especially the pedigreed Jewish-American ones in Manhattan. Reuben&#39;s and Lindy&#39;s are two leaders at about five dollars a cake. Some are fruited with cherries or strawberries.</p><p>Cheese Custard</p><p>4 eggs, slightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup milk A dash of pepper or paprika 3 tablespoons melted butter A few drops of onion juice, if desired 4 tablespoons grated Swiss (imported)</p><pre><code> Mix all together, set in molds in pan of hot water, and bake

Good, too, are figs, both fresh and preserved, stuffed with cream cheese, kumquats, avocados, fruity dunking mixtures of Pineapple cheese, served in the scooped-out casque of the cheese itself, and apple or pear and Provolone creamed and put back in the rind it came in.

Thomas Gray, the English poet, saluted it two centuries ago with:</p><pre><code>Parma, the happy country where huge cheeses grow.
</code></pre><p>On September 4, 1666, Pepys recorded the burying of his pet Parmesan, &quot;as well as my wine and some other things,&quot; in a pit in Sir W. Batten&#39;s garden. And on the selfsame fourth of September, more than a century later, in 1784, Woodforde in his <em>Diary of a Country Parson</em> wrote:</p><pre><code> I sent Mr. Custance about 3 doz. more of apricots, and he sent me
 back another large piece of fine Parmesan cheese. It was very
 kind of him.
</code></pre><p>The second most popular cheese for <em>au gratin</em> is Italian Romano, and, for an entirely different flavor, Swiss Sapsago. The French, who gave us this cookery term, use it in its original meaning for any dish with a browned topping, usually of bread crumbs, or crumbs and cheese. In America we think of <em>au gratin</em> as grated cheese only, although Webster says, &quot;with a browned covering, often mixed with butter or cheese; as, potatoes <em>au gratin</em>.&quot; So let us begin with that.</p><p>Potatoes au Gratin</p><p>2 cups diced cooked potatoes 2 tablespoons grated onion 1/2 cup grated American Cheddar cheese 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup milk 1 egg Salt Pepper More grated cheese for covering</p><pre><code> In a buttered baking dish put a layer of diced potatoes, sprinkle
 with onion and bits of butter. Next, scatter on a thin layer of
 cheese and alternate with potatoes, onions and butter. Stir milk,
 egg, salt and pepper together and pour it on the mixture. Top
 everything with plenty of grated cheese to make it authentically
 American _au gratin_. Bake until firm in moderate oven, about 1/2
 hour.
</code></pre><p>Eggs au Gratin</p><pre><code> Make a white sauce flavored with minced onion to pour over any
 desired number of eggs broken into a buttered baking dish. Begin
 by using half of the sauce and sprinkling on a lot of grated
 cheese. After the eggs are in, pour on the rest of the sauce,
 cover it with grated cheese and bread crumbs, drop in bits of
 butter, and cook until brown in oven (or about 12 minutes).
</code></pre><p>Tomatoes au Gratin</p><pre><code> Cover bottom of shallow baking pan with slices of tomato and
 sprinkle liberally with bread crumbs and grated cheese, season
 with salt, pepper and dots of butter, add another layer of
 tomato slices, season as before and continue this, alternating
 with cheese, until pan is full. Add a generous topping of crumbs,
 cheese and butter. Bake 50 minutes in moderate oven.
</code></pre><p>Onion Soup au Gratin</p><p>4 or 5 onions, sliced 4 or 5 tablespoons butter 1 quart stock or canned consomme 1 quart bouillon made from dissolving 4 or 5 cubes Rounds of toasted French bread 1-1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</p><pre><code> Saute onions in butter in a roomy saucepan until light golden,
 and pour the stock over. When heated put in a larger casserole,
 add the bouillon, season to taste and heat to boiling point. Let
 simmer 15 minutes and serve in deep well-heated soup plates, the
 bottoms covered with rounds of toasted French bread which have
 been heaped with freshly grated Parmesan and browned under the
 broiler. More cheese is served for guests to sprinkle on as
 desired.
</code></pre><p>At gala parties, where wine flows, a couple of glasses of champagne are often added to the bouillon.</p><p>In the famed onion soup <em>au gratin</em> at Les Halles in Paris, grated Gruyere is used in place of Parmesan. They are interchangeable in this recipe.</p><p>AMERICAN CHEESE SOUPS</p><pre><code> In this era of fine canned soups a quick cheese soup is made by
 heating cream of tomato soup, ready made, and adding finely
 grated Swiss or Parmesan to taste. French bread toasted and
 topped with more cheese and broiled golden makes the best base to
 pour this over, as is done with the French onion soup above.

 The same cheese toasts are the basis of a simple milk-cheese
 soup, with heated milk poured over and a seasoning of salt,
 pepper, chopped chives, or a dash of nutmeg.
</code></pre><p>Chicken Cheese Soup</p><pre><code> Heat together 1 cup milk, 1 cup water in which 2 chicken bouillon
 cubes have been dissolved, and 1 can of condensed cream of
 chicken soup. Stir in 1/4 cup grated American Cheddar cheese and
 season with salt, pepper, and plenty of paprika until cheese
 melts.

 Other popular American recipes simply add grated cheese to lima
 bean or split bean soup, peanut butter soup, or plain cheese soup
 with rice.
</code></pre><p>Imported French <em>marmites</em> are <em>de rigueur</em> for a real onion soup <em>au gratin</em>, and an imported Parmesan grinder might be used for freshly ground cheese. In preparing, it is well to remember that they are basically only melted cheese, melted from the top down.</p><p>CHEESE SALADS</p><pre><code> When a Frenchman reaches the salad he is resting and in no hurry.
 He eats the salad to prepare himself for the cheese.

 Henri Charpentier, _Life &amp; la Henri_,
</code></pre><p>Green Cheese Salad Julienne</p><pre><code> Take endive, water cress and as many different kinds of crisp
 lettuce as you can find and mix well with Provolone cheese cut in
 thin julienne strips and marinated 3 to 4 hours in French
 dressing. Crumble over the salad some Blue cheese and toss
 everything thoroughly, with plenty of French dressing.
</code></pre><p>American Cheese Salad</p><pre><code> Slice a sweet ripe pineapple thin and sprinkle with shredded
 American Cheddar. Serve on lettuce dipped in French dressing.
</code></pre><p>Cheese and Nut Salad</p><pre><code> Mix American Cheddar with an equal amount of nut meats and enough
 mayonnaise to make a paste. Roll these in little balls and serve
 with fruit salads, dusting lightly with finely grated Sapsago.
</code></pre><p>Brie or Camembert Salad</p><pre><code> Fill ripe pear-or peach-halves with creamy imported Brie or
 Camembert, sprinkle with honey, serve on lettuce drenched with
 French dressing and scatter shredded almonds over. (Cream cheese
 will do in a pinch. If the Camembert isn&#39;t creamy enough, mash it
 with some sweet cream.)
</code></pre><p>Three-in-One Mold</p><p>3/4 cup cream cheese 1/2 cup grated American Cheddar cheese 1/2 cup Roquefort cheese, crumbled 2 tablespoons gelatin, dissolved and stirred into 1/2 cup boiling water Juice of 1 lemon Salt Pepper 2 cups cream, beaten stiff 1/2 cup minced chives</p><pre><code> Mash the cheeses together, season gelatin liquid with lemon, salt
 and pepper and stir into cheese with the whipped cream. Add
 chives last Put in ring mold or any mold you fancy, chill well
 and slice at table to serve on lettuce with a little mayonnaise,
 or plain.
</code></pre><p>Swiss Cheese Salad</p><pre><code> Dice 1/2 pound of cheese into 1/2-inch cubes. Slice one onion
 very thin. Mix well in a soup plate. Dash with German mustard,
 olive oil, wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce. Salt lightly and
 grind in plenty of black pepper. Then stir, preferably with a
 wooden spoon so you won&#39;t mash the cheese, until every hole is
 drenched with the dressing.
</code></pre><p>Rosie&#39;s Swiss Breakfast Cheese Salad</p><p>Often Emmentaler is cubed in a salad for breakfast, relished specially by males on the morning after. We quote the original recipe brought over by Rosie from the Swiss Tyrol to thrill the writers&#39; and artists&#39; colony of Ridgefield, New Jersey, in her brother Emil&#39;s White House Inn:</p><pre><code> First Rosie cut a thick slice of prime imported Emmentaler into
 half-inch cubes. Then she mixed imported French olive oil, German
 mustard and Swiss white wine vinegar with salt and freshly ground
 pepper in a deep soup plate, sprinkled on a few drops of pepper
 sauce scattered in the chunks of Schweizer and stirred the cubes
 with a light hand, using a wooden fork and spoon to prevent
 bruising.

 The salad was ready to eat only when each and every tiny, shiny
 cell of the Swiss from the homeland had been washed, oiled and
 polished with the soothing mixture.

 &quot;Drink down the juice, too, when you have finished mine Breakfast
 Cheese Salad,&quot; Rosie advised the customers. &quot;It is the best cure
 in the world for the worst hangover.&quot;

 lemon juice and spread with creamy Gorgonzola. Sluice with French
 dressing made with lemon juice in place of vinegar, to help bring
 out the natural banana flavor of ripe Gorgonzola.
</code></pre><p>Cheese and Pea Salad</p><pre><code> Cube 1/2 pound of American Cheddar and mix with a can of peas, 1
 cup of diced celery, 1 cup of mayonnaise, 1/2 cup of sour cream,
 and 2 tablespoons each of minced pimientos and sweet pickles.
 Serve in lettuce cups with a sprinkling of parsley and chopped
 radishes.
</code></pre><p>Apple and Cheese Salad</p><p>1/2 cup cream cheese 1 cup chopped pecans Salt and pepper Apples, sliced 1/2-inch thick Lettuce leaves Creamy salad dressing</p><pre><code> Make tiny seasoned cheese balls, center on the apple slices
 standing on lettuce leaves, and sluice with creamy salad
 dressing.
</code></pre><p>Roquefort Cheese Salad Dressing</p><pre><code> No cheese sauce is easier to make than the American favorite of
 Roquefort cheese mashed with a fork and mixed with French
 dressing. It is often made in a pint Mason jar and kept in the
 refrigerator to shake up on occasion and toss over lettuce or
 other salads.
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, even when the Roquefort is the French import, complete with the picture of the sheep in red, and <em>garanti veritable</em>, the dressing is often ruined by bad vinegar and cottonseed oil (of all things). When bottled to sell in stores, all sorts of extraneous spice, oils and mustard flour are used where nothing more is necessary than the manipulation of a fork, fine olive oil and good vinegar--white wine, tarragon or malt. Some ardent amateurs must have their splash of Worcestershire sauce or lemon juice with salt and pepper. This Roquefort dressing is good on all green salads, but on endive it&#39;s something special.</p><p>SAUCE MORNAY</p><p>Sauce Mornay has been hailed internationally as &quot;the greatest culinary achievement in cheese.&quot;</p><pre><code> Nothing is simpler to make. All you do is prepare a white sauce
 (the French Sauce Bechamel) and add grated Parmesan to your
 liking, stirring it in until melted and the sauce is creamy. This
 can be snapped up with cayenne or minced parsley, and when used
 with fish a little of the cooking broth is added.
</code></pre><p>PLAIN CHEESE SAUCE</p><p>1 part of any grated cheese to 4 parts of white sauce</p><pre><code> This is a mild sauce that is nice with creamed or hard-cooked
 eggs. When the cheese content is doubled, 2 parts of cheese to 4
 of white sauce, it is delicious on boiled cauliflower, baked
 potatoes, macaroni and crackers soaked in milk.

 The sauce may be made richer by mixing melted butter with the
 flour in making the white sauce, or by beating egg yolk in with
 the cheese.
</code></pre><p>From thin to medium to thick it serves divers purposes:</p><p><em>Thin</em>: it may be used instead of milk to make a tasty milk toast, sometimes spiced with curry.</p><p><em>Medium</em>: for baking by pouring over crackers soaked in milk.</p><p><em>Thick</em>: serves as a sort of Welsh Rabbit when poured generously over bread toasted on one side only, with the untoasted side up, to let the sauce sink in.</p><p>PARSLEYED CHEESE SAUCE</p><pre><code> This makes a mild, pleasantly pungent sauce, to enliven the
 cabbage family--hot cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage and Brussels
 sprouts. Croutons help when sprinkled over.
</code></pre><p>CORNUCOPIA OF CHEESE RECIPES</p><p>Since this is the Complete Book of Cheese we will fill a bounteous cornucopia here with more or less essential, if not indispensable, recipes and dishes not so easy to classify, or overlooked or crowded out of the main sections devoted to the classic Fondues, Rabbits, Souffles, etc.</p><p><em>Stuffed Celery, Endive, Anise and Other Suitable Stalks</em></p><p>Use any soft cheese you like, or firm cheese softened by pressing through a sieve; at room temperature, of course, with any seasoning or relish.</p><pre><code> SUGGESTIONS:

 Cream cheese and chopped chives, pimientos, olives, or all three,
 with or without a touch of Worcestershire.

 Cottage cheese and piccalilli or chili sauce.

 Sharp Cheddar mixed with mayonnaise, mustard, cream, minced
 capers, pickles, or minced ham.

 Roquefort and other Blues are excellent fillings for your
 favorite vegetable stalk, or scooped-out dill pickle. This last
 is specially nice when filled with snappy cheese creamed with
 sweet butter.

 All canape butters are ideally suited to stuffing stalks.
 Pineapple cheese, especially that part close to the
 pineapple-flavored rind, is perfect when creamed.

 A masterpiece in the line of filled stalks: Cut the leafy tops
 off an entire head of celery, endive, anise or anything similarly
 suitable. Wash and separate stalks, but keep them in order, to
 reassemble in the head after each is stuffed with a different
 mixture, using any of the above, or a tangy mix of your own
 concoction.

 After all stalks are filled, beginning with the baby center ones,
 press them together in the form of the original head, tie tight,
 and chill. When ready, slice in rolls about 8-inch thick and
 arrange as a salad on a bed of water cress or lettuce, moistened
 with French dressing.
</code></pre><p>Cold Dunking</p><pre><code> Besides hot dunking in Swiss Fondue, cold dunking may be had by
 moistening plenty of cream cheese with cream or lemon in a
 dunking bowl. When the cheese is sufficiently liquefied, it is
 liberally seasoned with chopped parsley, chives, onions, pimiento
 and/or other relish. Then a couple of tins of anchovies are
 macerated and stirred in, oil and all.
</code></pre><p>Cheese Charlotte</p><pre><code> Line a baking dish from bottom to top with decrusted slices of
 bread dipped in milk. Cream 1 tablespoon of sweet butter with 2
 eggs and season before stirring in 2 cups of grated cheese. Bake
 until golden brown in slow oven.
</code></pre><p>Straws</p><pre><code> Roll pastry dough thin and cover with grated Cheddar, fold and
 roll at least twice more, sprinkling with cheese each time. Chill
 dough in refrigerator and cut in straw-size strips. Stiffly salt
 a beaten egg yolk and glaze with that to give a salty taste. Bake
 for several minutes until crisp.
</code></pre><p>Supa Shetgia[B]</p><p>[Footnote B: (from <em>Cheese Cookery</em>, by Helmut Ripperger)]</p><pre><code> _This is the famous cheese soup of the Engadine and little known
 in this country. One of its seasonings is nutmeg and until one
 has used it in cheese dishes, it is hard to describe how
 perfectly it gives that extra something. The recipe, as given,
 is for each plate, but there is no reason why the old-fashioned
 tureen could not be used and the quantities simply increased_.

 Put a slice of stale French bread, toasted or not, into a soup
 plate and cover it with 4 tablespoons of grated or shredded Swiss
 cheese. Place another slice of bread on top of this and pour over
 it some boiling milk. Cover the plate and let it stand for
 several minutes. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Serve
 topped with browned, hot butter. Use whole nutmeg and grate it
 freshly.
</code></pre><p>WITH A CHEESE SHAKER ON THE TABLE</p><p>Italians are so dependent on cheese to enrich all their dishes, from soups to spaghetti--and indeed any vegetable--that a shaker of grated Parmesan, Romano or reasonable substitute stands ready at every table, or is served freshly grated on a side dish. Thus any Italian soup might be called a cheese soup, but we know of only one, the great minestrone, in which cheese is listed as an indispensable ingredient along with the pasta, peas, onion, tomatoes, kidney beans, celery, olive oil, garlic, oregano, potatoes, carrots, and so forth.</p><p>Likewise, a chunk of melting or toasting cheese is essential in the Fritto Misto, the finest mixed grill we know, and it&#39;s served up as a separate tidbit with the meats.</p><p>Italians grate on more cheese for seasoning than any other people, as the French are wont to use more wine in cooking.</p><p>Pfeffernuesse and Caraway</p><p>The gingery little &quot;pepper nuts,&quot; <em>pfeffernuesse</em>, imported from Germany in barrels at Christmastime, make one of the best accompaniments to almost any kind of cheese. For contrast try a dish of caraway.</p><p>Diablotins</p><p>Small rounds of buttered bread or toast heaped with a mound of grated cheese and browned in the oven is a French contribution.</p><p>CHEESE OMELETS</p><p>Cheddar Omelet</p><pre><code> Make a plain omelet your own way. When the mixture has just begun
 to cook, dust over it evenly 1/2 cup grated Cheddar.
 (a) Use young Cheddar if you want a mild, bland omelet
 (b) Use sharp, aged Cheddar for a full-flavored one.
 (c) Sprinkle (b) with Worcestershire sauce to make what might be
 called a Wild Omelet.
 Cook as usual. Fold and serve.
</code></pre><p>Parmesan Omelet (mild)</p><pre><code> Cook as above, but use 1/4 cup only of Parmesan, grated fine, in
 place of the 1/2 cup Cheddar.
</code></pre><p>Parmesan Omelet (full flavored)</p><pre><code> As above, but use 1/2 cup Parmesan, finely grated, as follows:
 Sift 1/4 cup of the Parmesan into your egg mixture at the
 beginning and dust on the second 1/4 cup evenly, just as the
 omelet begins to set.
</code></pre><p>A Meal-in-One Omelet</p><pre><code> Fry 1/2 dozen bacon slices crisp and keep hot while frying a cup
 of diced, boiled potatoes in the bacon fat, to equal crispness.
 Meanwhile make your omelet mixture of 3 eggs, beaten, and 1-1/2
 tablespoons of shredded Emmentaler (or domestic Swiss) with 1
 tablespoon of chopped chives and salt and pepper to taste.
</code></pre><p>Tomato and</p><pre><code> Make plain omelet, cover with thin rounds of fresh tomato and
 dust well with any grated cheese you like. Put under broiler
 until cheese melts to a golden brown.
</code></pre><p>Omelet with Cheese Sauce</p><pre><code> Make a plain French, fluffy or puffy omelet and when finished,
 cover with a hot, seasoned, reinforced white sauce in which 1/4
 pound of shredded cheese has been melted, and mixed well with 1/2
 cup cooked, diced celery and 1 tablespoon of pimiento, minced.
</code></pre><p>The French use grated Gruyere for this with all sorts of sauces, such as the <em>Savoyar de Savoie</em>, with potatoes, chervil, tarragon and cream. A delicious appearance and added flavor can be had by browning with a salamander.</p><p>Spanish Flan--Quesillo</p><p>FOR THE CARAMEL: 1/2 cup sugar 4 tablespoons water</p><p>FOR THE FLAN: 4 eggs, beaten separately 2 cups hot milk 1/2 cup sugar Salt</p><pre><code> Brown sugar and mix with water to make the caramel. Pour it into
 a baking mold.

 Make Flan by mixing together all the ingredients. Add to
 carameled mold and bake in pan of water in moderate oven about
 3/4 hour.
</code></pre><p>Italian Fritto Misto</p><pre><code> The distinctive Italian Mixed Fry, Fritto Misto, is made with
 whatever fish, sweetbreads, brains, kidneys, or tidbits of meat
 are at hand, say a half dozen different cubes of meat and
 giblets, with as many hearts of artichokes, _finocchi_, tomato,
 and different vegetables as you can find, but always with a hunk
 of melting cheese, to fork out in golden threads with each
 mouthful of the mixture.
</code></pre><p>Polish Piroghs (a pocketful of cheese)</p><pre><code> Make noodle dough with 2 eggs and 2 cups of flour, roll out very
 thin and cut in 2-inch squares.

 Cream a cupful of cottage cheese with a tablespoon of melted
 butter, flavor with cinnamon and toss in a handful of seedless
 currents.

 Fill pastry squares with this and pinch edges tight together to
 make little pockets.

 Drop into a lot of fast-boiling water, lightly salted, and boil
 steadily 30 minutes, lowering the heat so the pockets won&#39;t burst
 open.

 Drain and serve on a piping hot platter with melted butter and a
 sprinkling of bread crumbs.

 This is a cross between ravioli and blintzes.
</code></pre><p>Cheesed Mashed Potatoes</p><pre><code> Whip into a steaming hot dish of creamily mashed potatoes some
 old Cheddar with melted butter and a crumbling of crisp, cooked
 bacon.
</code></pre><p>If there&#39;s a chafing dish handy, a first-rate nightcap can be made via a</p><p>Sauteed Swiss Sandwich</p><pre><code> Tuck a slice of Swiss cheese between two pieces of thickly
 buttered bread, trim crusts, cut sandwich in two, surround it
 with one well-beaten egg, slide it into sizzling butter and fry
 on both sides. A chef at the New York Athletic Club once improved
 on this by first sandwiching the Swiss between a slice of ham and
 a slice of chicken breast, then beating up a brace of eggs with a
 jigger of heavy sweet cream and soaking his sandwich in this
 until it sopped up every drop. A final frying in sweet butter
 made strong men cry for it.
</code></pre><p>[Illustration]</p><p><em>Chapter Ten</em></p><p>Appetizers, Crackers, Sandwiches, Savories, Snacks, Spreads and Toasts</p><p>In America cheese got its start in country stores in our cracker-barrel days when every man felt free to saunter in, pick up the cheese knife and cut himself a wedge from the big-bellied rattrap cheese standing under its glass bell or wire mesh hood that kept the flies off but not the free-lunchers. Cheese by itself being none too palatable, the taster would saunter over to the cracker barrel, shoo the cat off and help himself to the old-time crackers that can&#39;t be beat today.</p><p>At that time Wisconsin still belonged to the Indians and Vermont was our leading cheese state, with its Sage and Cheddar and Vermont Country Store Crackers, as Vrest Orton of Weston Vermont, calls them. When Orton heard we were writing this book, he sent samples from the store his father started in 1897 which is still going strong. Together with the Vermont Good Old-fashioned Natural Cheese and the Sage came a handy handmade Cracker Basket, all wicker, ten crackers long and just one double cracker wide. A snug little casket for those puffy, old-time, two-in-one soda biscuits that have no salt to spoil the taste of the accompanying cheese. Each does double duty because it&#39;s made to split in the middle, so you can try one kind of cheese on one half and another on t&#39;other, or sandwich them between.</p><p>Some Pied Piper took the country cheese and crackers to the corner saloon and led a free-lunch procession that never faltered till Prohibition came. The same old store cheese was soon pepped up as saloon cheese with a saucer of caraway seeds, bowls of pickles, peppers, pickled peppers and rye bread with plenty of mustard, pretzels or cheese straws, smearcase and schwarzbrot. Beer and cheese forever together, as in the free-lunch ditty of that great day:</p><pre><code>I am an Irish hunter;
I am, I ain&#39;t.
I do not hunt for deer
But beer.
Oh, Otto, wring the bar rag.

I do not hunt for fleas
But cheese.
Oh, Adolph, bring the free lunch.
</code></pre><p>It was there and then that cheese came of age from coast to coast. In every bar there was a choice of Swiss, Cottage, Limburger--manly cheeses, walkie-talkie oldsters that could sit up and beg, golden yellow, tangy mellow, always cut in cubes. Cheese takes the cube form as naturally as eggs take the oval and honeycombs the hexagon.</p><p>On the more elegant handout buffets, besides the shapely cubes, free Welsh Rabbit started at four every afternoon, to lead the tired businessman in by the nose; or a smear of Canadian Snappy out of a pure white porcelain pot in the classy places, on a Bent&#39;s water biscuit.</p><p>SANDWICHES AND SAVORY SNACKS</p><p>Next to nibbling cheese with crackers and appetizers, of which there is no end in sight, cheese sandwiches help us consume most of our country&#39;s enormous output of Brick, Cheddar and Swiss. To attempt to classify and describe all of these would be impossible, so we will content ourselves by picking a few of the cold and hot, the plain and the fancy, the familiar and the exotic. Let&#39;s use the alphabet to sum up the situation.</p><p>A Alpine Club Sandwich</p><pre><code> Spread toasts with mayonnaise and fill with a thick slice of
 imported Emmentaler, well-mustarded and seasoned, and the usual
 club-sandwich toppings of thin slices of chicken or turkey,
 tomato, bacon and a lettuce leaf.
</code></pre><p>B Boston Beany, Open-face</p><pre><code> Lightly butter a slice of Boston brown bread, cover it generously
 with hot baked beans and a thick layer of shredded Cheddar. Top
 with bacon and put under a slow broiler until cheese melts and
 the bacon crisps.
</code></pre><p>C Cheeseburgers</p><pre><code> Pat out some small seasoned hamburgers exceedingly thin and,
 using them instead of slices of bread, sandwich in a nice slice
 of American Cheddar well covered with mustard. Crimp edges of the
 hamburgers all around to hold in the cheese when it melts and
 begins to run. Toast under a brisk boiler and serve on soft,
 toasted sandwich buns.
</code></pre><p>D Deviled Rye</p><pre><code> Butter flat Swedish rye bread and heat quickly in hot oven. Cool
 until crisp again. Then spread thickly with cream cheese,
 bedeviled with catsup, paprika or pimiento.
</code></pre><p>E Egg, Open-faced</p><pre><code> Saute minced small onion and small green pepper in 2 tablespoons
 of butter and make a sauce by cooking with a cup of canned
 tomatoes. Season and reduce to about half. Fry 4 eggs and put one
 in the center of each of 4 pieces of hot toast spread with the
 red sauce. Sprinkle each generously with grated Cheddar, broil
 until melted and serve with crisp bacon.
</code></pre><p>F French-fried Swiss</p><pre><code> Simply make a sandwich with a noble slice of imported Gruyere,
 soak it in beaten egg and milk and fry slowly till cheese melts
 and the sandwich is nicely browned. This is a specialty of
 Franche-Comte.
</code></pre><p>G Grilled Chicken-Ham-Cheddar</p><pre><code> Cut crusts from 2 slices of white bread and butter them on both
 sides. Make a sandwich of these with 1 slice cooked chicken, 1/2
 slice sharp Cheddar cheese, and a sprinkling of minced ham.
 Fasten tight with toothpicks, cut in half and dip thoroughly in a
 mixture of egg and milk. Grill golden on both sides and serve
 with lengthwise slices of dill pickle.
</code></pre><p>H He-man Sandwich, Open-faced</p><pre><code> Butter a thick slice of dark rye bread, cover with a layer of
 mashed cold baked beans and a slice of ham, then one of Swiss
 cheese and a wheel of Bermuda onion topped with mustard and a
 sowing of capers.
</code></pre><p>I International Sandwich</p><pre><code> Split English muffins and toast on the hard outsides, cover soft,
 untoasted insides with Swiss cheese, spread lightly with mustard,
 top that with a wheel of Bermuda onion and 1 or 2 slices of
 Italian-type tomato. Season with cayenne and salt, dot with
 butter, cover with Brazil nuts and brown under the broiler.
</code></pre><p>J Jurassiennes, or Croutes Comtoises</p><pre><code> Soak slices of stale buns in milk, cover with a mixture of onion
 browned in chopped lean bacon and mixed with grated Gruyere.
 Simmer until cheese melts, and serve.
</code></pre><p>K Kuemmelkaese</p><pre><code> If you like caraway flavor this is your sandwich: On
 well-buttered but lightly mustarded rye, lay a thickish slab of
 Milwaukee Kuemmelkaese, which translates caraway cheese. For good
 measure sprinkle caraway seeds on top, or serve them in a saucer
 on the side. Then dash on a splash of kuemmel, the caraway liqueur
 that&#39;s best when imported.
</code></pre><p>L Limburger Onion or Limburger Catsup</p><pre><code> Marinate slices of Bermuda onion in a peppery French dressing for
 1/2 hour. Then butter slices of rye, spread well with soft
 Limburger, top with onion and you will have something
 super-duper--if you like Limburger.

 When catsup is substituted for marinated onion the sandwich has
 quite another character and flavor, so true Limburger addicts
 make one of each and take alternate bites for the thrill of
 contrast.
</code></pre><p>M Meringue, Open-faced (from the Browns&#39; <em>10,000 Snacks</em>)</p><pre><code> Allow 1 egg and 4 tablespoons of grated cheese to 1 slice of
 bread. Toast bread on one side only, spread butter on untoasted
 side, put 2 tablespoons grated cheese over butter, and the yolk
 of an egg in the center. Beat egg white stiff with a few grains
 of salt and pile lightly on top. Sprinkle the other 2 tablespoons
 of grated cheese over that and bake in moderate oven until the
 egg white is firm and the cheese has melted to a golden-brown.
</code></pre><p>N Neufchatel and Honey</p><pre><code> We know no sandwich more ethereal than one made with thin,
 decrusted, white bread, spread with sweet butter, then with
 Neufchatel topped with some fine honey--Mount Hymettus, if
 possible.

 Any creamy Petit Suisse will do as well as the Neufchatel, but
 nothing will take the place of the honey to make this heavenly
 sandwich that must have been the original ambrosia.
</code></pre><p>O Oskar&#39;s Ham-Cam</p><pre><code> Oskar Davidsen of Copenhagen, whose five-foot menu lists 186
 superb sandwiches and snacks, each with a character all its own,
 perfected the Ham-Cam base for a flock of fancy ham sandwiches,
 open-faced on rye or white, soft or crisp, sweet or sour, almost
 any one-way slice you desire. He uses as many contrasting kinds
 of bread as possible, and his butter varies from salt to fresh
 and whipped. The Ham-Cam base involves &quot;a juicy, tender slice of
 freshly boiled, mild-cured ham&quot; with imported Camembert spread on
 the ham as thick as velvet.

 The Ham-Cam is built up with such splendors as &quot;goose liver
 paste and Madeira wine jelly,&quot; &quot;fried calves&#39; kidney and
 _remoulade_,&quot; &quot;Bombay curry salad,&quot; &quot;bird&#39;s liver and fried egg,&quot;
 &quot;a slice of red roast beef&quot; and more of that red Madeira jelly,
 with anything else you say, just so long as it does credit to
 Camembert on ham.
</code></pre><p>P Pickled Camembert</p><pre><code> Butter a thin slice of rye or pumpernickel and spread with ripe
 imported Camembert, when in season (which isn&#39;t summer). Make a
 mixture of sweet, sour and dill pickles, finely chopped, and
 spread it on. Top this with a thin slice of white bread for
 pleasing contrast with the black.
</code></pre><p>Q Queijo da Serra Sandwich</p><pre><code> On generous rounds of French &quot;flute&quot; or other crunchy, crusty
 white bread place thick portions of any good Portuguese cheese
 made of sheep&#39;s milk &quot;in the mountains.&quot; This last translates
 back into Queijo da Serra, the fattest, finest cheese in the
 world--on a par with fine Greek Feta. Bead the open-faced creamy
 cheese lightly with imported capers, and you&#39;ll say it&#39;s
 scrumptious.
</code></pre><p>R Roquefort Nut</p><pre><code> Butter hot toast and cover with a thickish slice of genuine
 Roquefort cheese. Sprinkle thickly with genuine Hungarian
 paprika. Put in moderate oven for about 6 minutes. Finish it off
 with chopped pine nuts, almonds, or a mixture thereof.
</code></pre><p>S Smoky Sandwich and Sturgeon-smoked Sandwich</p><pre><code> Skin some juicy little, jolly little sprats, lay on thin rye, or
 a slice of miniature-loaf rye studded with caraway, spread with
 sweet butter and cover with a slice of smoked cheese.

 Hickory is preferred for most of the smoking in America. In New
 York the best smoked cheese, whether from Canada or nearer home,
 is usually cured in the same room with sturgeon. Since this king
 of smoked fish imparts some of its regal savor to the Cheddar,
 there is a natural affinity peculiarly suited to sandwiching as
 above.

 Smoked salmon, eel, whitefish or any other, is also good with
 cheese smoked with hickory or anything with a salubrious savor,
 while a sandwich of smoked turkey with smoked cheese is out of
 this world. We accompany it with a cup of smoky Lapsang Soochong
 China tea.
</code></pre><p>T Tangy Sandwich</p><pre><code> On buttered rye spread cream cheese, and on this bed lay thinly
 sliced dried beef. In place of mustard dot the beef with
 horseradish and pearl onions or those reliable old chopped
 chives. And by the way, if you must use mustard on every cheese
 sandwich, try different kinds for a change: sharp English freshly
 mixed by your own hand out of the tin of powder, or Dijon for a
 French touch.
</code></pre><p>U Unusual Sandwich--of Flowers, Hay and Clover</p><pre><code> On a sweet-buttered slice of French white bread lay a layer of
 equally sweet English Flower cheese (made with petals of rose,
 marigold, violet, etc.) and top that with French Fromage de foin.
 This French hay cheese gets its name from being ripened on hay
 and holds its new-mown scent. Sprinkle on a few imported capers
 (the smaller they are, the better), with a little of the luscious
 juice, and dust lightly with Sapsago.
</code></pre><p>V Vegetarian Sandwich</p><pre><code> Roll your own of alternate leaves of lettuce, slices of store
 cheese, avocados, cream cheese sprinkled heavily with chopped
 chives, and anything else in the Vegetable or Caseous Kingdoms
 that suits your fancy.
</code></pre><p>W Witch&#39;s Sandwich</p><pre><code> Butter 2 slices of sandwich bread, cover one with a thin slice of
 imported Emmentaler, dash with cayenne and a drop or two of
 tabasco. Slap on a sizzling hot slice of grilled ham and press it
 together with the cheese between the two bread slices, put in a
 hot oven and serve piping hot with a handful of
 &quot;moonstones&quot;--those outsize pearl onions.
</code></pre><p>X Xochomilco Sandwich</p><pre><code> In spite of the &quot;milco&quot; in Xochomilco, there isn&#39;t a drop to be
 had that&#39;s native to the festive, floating gardens near Mexico
 City. For there, instead of the cow, a sort of century plant
 gives milky white _pulque_, the fermented juice of this
 cactuslike desert plant. With this goes a vegetable cheese curded
 by its own vegetable rennet. It&#39;s called tuna cheese, made from
 the milky juice of the prickly pear that grows on yet another
 cactuslike plant of the dry lands. This tuna cheese sometimes
 teams up in arid lands with the juicy thick cactus leaf sliced
 into a tortilla sandwich. The milky _pulque_ of Xochomilco goes
 as well with it as beer with a Swiss cheese sandwich.
</code></pre><p>Y Yolk Picnic Sandwich</p><pre><code> Hard-cooked egg yolk worked into a yellow paste with cream
 cheese, mustard, olive oil, lemon juice, celery salt and a touch
 of tabasco, spread on thick slices of whole wheat bread.
</code></pre><p>Z Zebra</p><pre><code> Take a tip from Oskar over in Copenhagen and design your own
 Zebra sandwich as decoratively as one of those oft-photoed skins
 in El Morocco. Just alternate stripes of black bread with various
 white cheeses in between, to follow, the black and white zebra
 pattern.
</code></pre><p>For good measure we will toss in a couple of toasted cheese sandwiches.</p><p>Toasted Cheese Sandwich</p><pre><code> Butter both sides of 2 thick slices of white bread and sandwich
 between them a seasoned mixture of shredded sharp cheese, egg
 yolk, mustard and chopped chives, together with stiffly beaten
 egg white folded in last to make a light filling. Fry the
 buttered sandwich in more butter until well melted and nicely
 gilded.
</code></pre><p>This toasted cheeser is so good it&#39;s positively sinful. The French, who outdo us in both cooking and sin, make one of their own in the form of fried fingers of stale bread doused in an &#39;arf and &#39;arf Welsh Rabbit and Fondue melting of Gruyere, that serves as a liaison to further sandwich the two.</p><p>Garlic is often used in place of chopped chives, and in contrast to this wild one there&#39;s a mild one made of Dutch cream cheese by the equally Dutch Pennsylvanians.</p><p>England, of course, together with Wales, holds all-time honors with such celebrated regional &quot;toasting cheeses&quot; as Devonshire and Dunlop. Even British Newfoundland is known for its simple version, that&#39;s quite as pleasing as its rich Prince Edward Island Oyster Stew.</p><p>Newfoundland Toasted Cheese Sandwich</p><p>1 pound grated Cheddar 1 egg, well beaten 1/2 cup milk 1 tablespoon butter</p><pre><code> Heat together and pour over well-buttered toast.
</code></pre><p>[Illustration]</p><p><em>Chapter Eleven</em></p><p>&quot;Fit for Drink&quot;</p><pre><code>A country without a fit drink for cheese has no cheese fit for
drink.
</code></pre><p>Greece was the first country to prove its epicurean fitness, according to the old saying above, for it had wine to tipple and sheep&#39;s milk cheese to nibble. The classical Greek cheese has always been Feta, and no doubt this was the kind that Circe combined most suitably with wine to make a farewell drink for her lovers. She put further sweetness and body into the stirrup cup by stirring honey and barley meal into it. Today we might whip this up in an electric mixer to toast her memory.</p><p>While a land flowing with milk and honey is the ideal of many, France, Italy, Spain or Portugal, flowing with wine and honey, suit a lot of gourmets better. Indeed, in such vinous-caseous places cheese is on the house at all wine sales for prospective customers to snack upon and thus bring out the full flavor of the cellared vintages. But professional wine tasters are forbidden any cheese between sips. They may clear their palates with plain bread, but nary a crumb of Roquefort or cube of Gruyere in working hours, lest it give the wine a spurious nobility.</p><p>And, speaking of Roquefort, Romanee has the closest affinity for it. Such affinities are also found in Pont l&#39;Eveque and Beaujolais, Brie and red champagne, Coulommiers and any good <em>vin rose</em>. Heavenly marriages are made in Burgundy between red and white wines of both Cotes, de Nuits and de Baune, and Burgundian cheeses such as Epoisses, Soumaintarin and Saint-Florentin. Pommard and Port-Salut seem to be made for each other, as do Chateau Margaux and Camembert.</p><p>A great cheese for a great wine is the rule that brings together in the neighboring provinces such notables as Sainte Maure, Valencay, Vendome and the Loire wines--Vouvray, Saumur and Anjou. Gruyere mates with Chablis, Camembert with St. Emilion; and any dry red wine, most commonly claret, is a fit drink for the hundreds of other fine French cheeses.</p><p>Every country has such happy marriages, an Italian standard being Provolone and Chianti. Then there is a most unusual pair, French Neufchatel cheese and Swiss Neuchatel wine from just across the border. Switzerland also has another cheese favorite at home--Trauben (grape cheese), named from the Neuchatel wine in which it is aged.</p><p>One kind of French Neufchatel cheese, Bondon, is also uniquely suited to the company of any good wine because it is made in the exact shape and size of a wine barrel bung. A similar relation is found in Brinzas (or Brindzas) that are packed in miniature wine barrels, strongly suggesting what should be drunk with such excellent cheeses: Hungarian Tokay. Other foreign cheeses go to market wrapped in vine leaves. The affinity has clearly been laid down in heaven.</p><p>Only the English seem to have a <em>fortissimo</em> taste in the go-with wines, according to these matches registered by Andre Simon in <em>The Art of Good Living:</em></p><p>Red Cheshire with Light Tawny Port White Cheshire with Oloroso Sherry Blue Leicester with Old Vintage Port Green Roquefort with New Vintage Port</p><p>To these we might add brittle chips of Greek Casere with nips of Amontillado, for an eloquent appetizer.</p><p>The English also pour port into Stilton, and sundry other wines and liquors into Cheddars and such. This doctoring leads to fraudulent imitation, however, for either port or stout is put into counterfeit Cheshire cheese to make up for the richness it lacks.</p><p>While some combinations of cheeses and wines may turn out palatable, we prefer taking ours straight. When something more fiery is needed we can twirl the flecks of pure gold in a chalice of Eau de Vie de Danzig and nibble on legitimate Danzig cheese unadulterated. <em>Goldwasser</em>, or Eau de Vie, was a favorite liqueur of cheese-loving Franklin Roosevelt, and we can be sure he took the two separately.</p><p>Another perfect combination, if you can take it, is imported kuemmel with any caraway-seeded cheese, or cream cheese with a handy saucer of caraway seeds. In the section of France devoted to gin, the juniper berries that flavor the drink also go into a local cheese, Fromage Fort. This is further fortified with brandy, white wine and pepper. One regional tipple with such brutally strong cheese is black coffee laced with gin.</p><p>French la Jonchee is another potted thriller with not only coffee and rum mixed in during the making, but orange flower water, too. Then there is la Petafina, made with brandy and absinthe; Hazebrook with brandy alone; and la Cachat with white wine and brandy.</p><p>In Italy white Gorgonzola is also put up in crocks with brandy. In Oporto the sharp cheese of that name is enlivened by port, Cider and the greatest of applejacks, Calvados, seem made to go the regional Calvados cheese. This is also true of our native Jersey Lightning and hard cider with their accompanying New York State cheese. In the Auge Valley of France, farmers also drink homemade cider with their own Augelot, a piquant kind of Pont l&#39;Eveque.</p><p>The English sip pear cider (perry) with almost any British cheese. Milk would seem to be redundant, but Sage cheese and buttermilk do go well together.</p><p>Wine and cheese have other things in common. Some wines and some cheeses are aged in caves, and there are vintage cheeses no less than vintage wines, as is the case with Stilton.</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p><em>Chapter Twelve</em></p><p>Lazy Lou</p><p>Once, so goes the sad story, there was a cheesemonger unworthy of his heritage. He exported a shipload of inferior &quot;Swiss&quot; made somewhere in the U.S.A. Bad to begin with, it had worsened on the voyage. Rejected by the health authorities on the other side, it was shipped back, reaching home in the unhappy condition known as &quot;cracked.&quot; To cut his losses the rascally cheesemonger had his cargo ground up and its flavor disguised with hot peppers and chili sauce. Thus there came into being the abortion known as the &quot;cheese spread.&quot;</p><p>The cheese spread or &quot;food&quot; and its cousin, the processed cheese, are handy, cheap and nasty. They are available everywhere and some people even like them. So any cheese book is bound to take formal notice of their existence. I have done so--and now, an unfond farewell to them.</p><p>My academic cheese education began at the University of Wisconsin in 1904. I grew up with our great Midwest industry; I have read with profit hundreds of pamphlets put out by the learned Aggies of my Alma Mater. Mostly they treat of honest, natural cheeses: the making, keeping and enjoying of authentic Longhorn Cheddars, short Bricks and naturalized Limburgers.</p><p>At the School of Agriculture the students still, I am told, keep their hand in by studying the classical layout on a cheese board. One booklet recommends the following for freshman contemplation:</p><pre><code>CARAWAY BRICK      SELECT BRICK            EDAM
WISCONSIN SWISS    LONGHORN AMERICAN       SHEFFORD
</code></pre><p>These six sturdy samples of Wisconsin&#39;s best will stimulate any amount of classroom discussion. Does the Edam go better with German-American black bread or with Swedish Ry-Krisp? To butter or not to butter? And if to butter, with which cheese? Salt or sweet? How close do we come to the excellence of the genuine Alpine Swiss? Primary school stuff, but not unworthy of thought.</p><p>Pass on down the years. You are now ready to graduate. Your cheese board can stand a more sophisticated setup. Try two boards; play the teams against each other.</p><pre><code>                   The All-American Champs

Your Scandinavian board alone, just to give an idea of the riches available, will shine with blues, yellows, whites, smoky browns, and chocolates representing Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Lapland.</p><p>For the Britisher only blue-veined Stilton is worthy to crown the banquet. The Frenchman defends Roquefort, the Dane his own regal Blue; the Swiss sticks to Emmentaler before, during and after all three meals. You may prefer to finish with a delicate Brie, a smoky slice of Provolone, a bit of Baby Gouda, or some Liptauer Garniert, about which more later.</p><p>We load them all on Lazy Lou, Lazy Susan&#39;s big twin brother, a giant roulette wheel of cheese, every number a winner. A second Lazy Lou will bear the savories and go-withs. For these tidbits the English have a divine genius; think of the deviled shrimps, smoked oysters, herring roe on toast, snips of broiled sausage ... But we will make do with some olives and radishes, a few pickles, nuts, capers. With our two trusty Lazy Lous on hand plus wine or beer, we can easily dispense with the mere dinner itself.</p><p>Perhaps it is an Italian night. Then Lazy Lou is happily burdened with imported Latticini; Incanestrato, still bearing the imprint of its wicker basket; Pepato, which is but Incanestrato peppered; Mel Fina; deep-yellow, buttery Scanno with its slightly burned flavor; tangy Asiago; Caciocavallo, so called because the the cheeses, tied in pairs and hung over a pole, look as though they were sitting in a saddle--cheese on horseback, or &quot;<em>cacio a cavallo</em>.&quot; Then we ring in Lazy Lou&#39;s first assistant, an old, silver-plated, revolving Florentine magnum-holder. It&#39;s designed to spin a gigantic flask of Chianti. The flick of a finger and the bottle is before you. Gently pull it down and hold your glass to the spout.</p><p>True, imported wines and cheeses are expensive. But native American products and reasonably edible imitations of the real thing are available as substitutes. Anyway, protein for protein, a cheese party will cost less than a steak barbecue. And it can be more fun.</p><p>Encourage your guests to contribute their own latest discoveries. One may bring along as his ticket of admission a Primavera from Brazil; another some cubes of an Andean specialty just flown in from Colombia&#39;s mountain city, Merida, and still wrapped in its aromatic leaves of <em>Frailejon Lanudo</em>; another a few wedges of savory sweet English Flower cheese, some flavored with rose petals, others with marigolds; another a tube of South American Kraeuterkaese.</p><p>Provide your own assortment of breads and try to include some of those fat, flaky old-fashioned crackers that country stores in New England can still supply. Mustard? Sure, if <em>.you</em> like it. If you want to be fancy, use a tricky little gadget put out by the Maille condiment-makers in France and available here in the food specialty shops. It&#39;s a miniature painter&#39;s palate holding five mustards of different shades and flavors and two mustard paddles. The mustards, in proper chromatic order, are: jonquil yellow &quot;Strong Dijon&quot;; &quot;Green Herbs&quot;; brownish &quot;Tarragon&quot;; golden &quot;Ora&quot;; crimson &quot;Tomato-flavored.&quot;</p><p>And, just to keep things moving, we have restored an antique whirling cruet-holder to deliver Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, A-1, Tap Sauce and Major Grey&#39;s Chutney. Salt shakers and pepper mills are handy, with a big-holed tin canister filled with crushed red-pepper pods, chili powder, Hungarian-paprika and such small matters. Butter, both sweet and salt, is on hand, together with, saucers or bowls of curry, capers, chives (sliced, not chopped), minced onion, fresh mint leaves, chopped pimientos, caraway, quartered lemons, parsley, fresh tarragon, tomato slices, red and white radishes, green and black olives, pearl onions and assorted nutmeats.</p><p>Some years ago, when I was collaborating with my mother, Cora, and my wife, Rose, in writing <em>10,000 Snacks</em> (which, by the way, devotes nearly forty pages to cheeses), we staged a rather elaborate tasting party just for the three of us. It took a two-tiered Lazy Lou to twirl the load.</p><p>The eight wedges on the top round were English and French samples and the lower one carried the rest, as follows:</p><pre><code>ENGLISH CHEDDAR  CHESHIRE     ENGLISH STILTON   CANADIAN CHEDDAR

                  HUNGARIAN LIPTAUER
</code></pre><p>The tasting began with familiar English Cheddars, Cheshires and Stiltons from the top row. We had cheese knives, scoops, graters, scrapers and a regulation wire saw, but for this line of crumbly Britishers fingers were best.</p><p>The Cheddar was a light, lemony-yellow, almost white, like our best domestic &quot;bar cheese&quot; of old.</p><p>The Cheshire was moldy and milky, with a slightly fermented flavor that brought up the musty dining room of Fleet Street&#39;s Cheshire cheese and called for draughts of beer. The Stilton was strong but mellow, as high in flavor as in price.</p><p>Only the rum-flavored Canadian Cheddar from Montreal (by courtesy English) let us down. It was done up as fancy as a bridegroom in waxed white paper and looked as smooth and glossy as a gardenia. But there its beauty ended. Either the rum that flavored it wasn&#39;t up to much or the mixture hadn&#39;t been allowed to ripen naturally.</p><p>The French Muenster, however, was hearty, cheery, and better made than most German Muenster, which at that time wasn&#39;t being exported much by the Nazis. The Brie was melting prime, the Camembert was so perfectly matured we ate every scrap of the crust, which can&#39;t be done with many American &quot;Camemberts&quot; or, indeed, with the dead, dry French ones sold out of season. Then came the Roquefort, a regal cheese we voted the best buy of the lot, even though it was the most expensive. A plump piece, pleasantly unctuous but not greasy, sharp in scent, stimulatingly bittersweet in taste--unbeatable. There is no American pretender to the Roquefort throne. Ours is invariably chalky and tasteless. That doesn&#39;t mean we have no good Blues. We have. But they are not Roquefort.</p><p>The Sapsago or Kraeuterkaese from Switzerland (it has been made in the Canton of Glarus for over five hundred years) was the least expensive of the lot. Well-cured and dry, it lent itself to grating and tasted fine on an old-fashioned buttered soda cracker. Sapsago has its own seduction, derived from the clover-leaf powder with which the curd is mixed and which gives it its haunting flavor and spring-like sage-green color.</p><p>Next came some truly great Swiss Gruyere, delicately rich, and nutty enough to make us think of the sharp white wines to be drunk with it at the source.</p><p>As for the Provolone, notable for the water-buffalo milk that makes it, there&#39;s an example of really grown-up milk. Perfumed as spring flowers drenched with a shower of Anjou, having a bouquet all its own and a trace of a winelike kick, it made us vow never to taste another American imitation. Only a smooth-cheeked, thick slab cut from a pedigreed Italian Provolone of medium girth, all in one piece and with no sign of a crack, satisfy the gourmet.</p><p>The second Italian classic was Gorgonzola, gorgeous Gorgonzola, as fruity as apples, peaches and pears sliced together. It smells so much like a ripe banana we often eat them together, plain or with the crumbly <em>formaggio</em> lightly forked into the fruit, split lengthwise.</p><p>After that the Edam tasted too lipsticky, like the red-paint job on its rind, and the Gouda seemed only half-hearted. Both too obviously ready-made for commerce with nothing individual or custom-made about them, rolled or bounced over from Holland by the boat load.</p><p>The Ostiepki from Czechoslovakia might have been a link of smoked ostrich sausage put up in the skin of its own red neck. In spite of its pleasing lemon-yellow interior, we couldn&#39;t think of any use for it except maybe crumbling thirty or forty cents&#39; worth into a ten-cent bowl of bean soup. But that seemed like a waste of money, so we set it aside to try in tiny chunks on crackers as an appetizer some other day, when it might be more appetizing.</p><p>We felt much the same about the chocolate-brown Norwegian Gjetost that looked like a slab of boarding-school fudge and which had the same cloying cling to the tongue. We were told by a native that our piece was entirely too young. That&#39;s what made it so insipid, undeveloped in texture and flavor. But the next piece we got turned out to be too old and decrepit, and so strong it would have taken a Paul Bunyan to stand up under it. When we complained to our expert about the shock to our palates, he only laughed, pointing to the nail on his little finger.</p><p>&quot;You should take just a little bit, like that. A pill no bigger than a couple of aspirins or an Alka-Seltzer. It&#39;s only in the morning you take it when it&#39;s old and strong like this, for a pick-me-up, a cure for a hangover, you know, like a prairie oyster well soused in Worcestershire.&quot;</p><p>That made us think we might use it up to flavor a Welsh Rabbit, <em>instead</em> of the Worcestershire sauce, but we couldn&#39;t melt it with anything less than a blowtorch.</p><p>To bring the party to a happy end, we went to town on the Hungarian Liptauer, garnishing that fine, granulating buttery base after mixing it well with some cream cheese. We mixed the mixed cheese with sardine and tuna mashed together in a little of the oil from the can. We juiced it with lemon, sluiced it with bottled sauces, worked in the leftovers, some tarragon, mint, spicy seeds, parsley, capers and chives. We peppered and paprikaed it, salted and spiced it, then spread it thicker than butter on pumpernickel and went to it. <em>That&#39;s</em> Liptauer Garniert.</p><p>[Illustration: No. 4 Cheese Inc.]</p><p><em>Appendix</em></p><p>The A-B-Z of Cheese</p><p><em>Each cheese is listed by its name and country of origin, with any further information available.

Soft; sheep and sometimes goat or cow; in cylinders of three sizes, weighing respectively about two ounces, one pound, and four pounds. The smaller sizes are the ones most often made with mixed goat and sheep milk. The method of curdling without the usual animal rennet is interesting and unusual. The milk is warmed and curdled with vegetable rennet made from the flowers of a local thistle, or cardoon, which is used in two other Portuguese cheeses--Queijo da Cardiga and Queijo da Serra da Estrella--and probably in many others not known beyond their locale. In France la Caillebotte is distinguished for being clabbered with <em>chardonnette</em>, wild artichoke seed. In Portugal, where there isn&#39;t so much separating of the sheep from the goats, it takes several weeks for Alemtejos to ripen, depending on the lactic content and difference in sizes.</p><p>Alfalfa <em>see</em> Sage.</p><p>Alise Saint-Reine <em>France</em></p><p>Soft; summer-made.</p><p>Allgaeuer Bergkaese, Allgaeuer Rundkaese, or Allgaeuer Emmentaler <em>Bavaria</em></p><p>Hard; Emmentaler type. The small district of Allgaeu names a mountain of cheeses almost as fabulous as our &quot;Rock-candy Mountain.&quot; There are two principal kinds, vintage Allgaeuer Bergkaese and soft Allgaeuer Rahmkaese, described below. This celebrated cheese section runs through rich pasture lands right down and into the Swiss Valley of the Emme that gives the name Emmentaler to one of the world&#39;s greatest. So it is no wonder that Allgaeuer Bergkaese can compete with the best Swiss. Before the Russian revolution, in fact, all vintage cheeses of Allgaeu were bought up by wealthy Russian noblemen and kept in their home caves in separate compartments for each year, as far back as the early 1900&#39;s. As with fine vintage wines, the price of the great years went up steadily. Such cheeses were shipped to their Russian owners only when the chief cheese-pluggers of Allgaeu found they had reached their prime.</p><p>Allgaeuer Rahmkaese <em>Bavaria</em></p><p>Full cream, similar to Romadur and Limburger, but milder than both. This sets a high grade for similar cheeses made in the Bavarian mountains, in monasteries such as Andechs. It goes exquisitely with the rich dark Bavarian beer. Some of it is as slippery as the stronger, smellier Bierkaese, or the old-time Slipcote of England. Like so many North Europeans, it is often flavored with caraway. Although entirely different from its big brother, vintage Bergkaese, Rahmkaese can stand proudly at its side as one of the finest cheeses in Germany.</p><p>Alpe <em>see</em> Fiore di Alpe.</p><p>Al Pepe <em>Italy</em></p><p>Hard and peppery, like its name.

They come in as many different shapes, with traditional names such as Daisies, Flats, Longhorns, Midgets, Picnics, Prints and Twins. The ones simply called Cheddars weigh about sixty pounds. All are made and pressed and ripened in about the same way, although they differ greatly in flavor and quality. They are ripened anywhere from two months to two years and become sharper, richer and more flavorsome, as well as more expensive, with the passing of time. <em>See</em> Cheddar states and Cheddar types in Chapter 4.</p><p>Americano Romano <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>Hard; brittle; sharp.</p><p>Amou <em>Bearn, France</em></p><p>Winter cheese, October to May.</p><p>Anatolian <em>Turkey</em></p><p>Hard; sharp.</p><p>Anchovy Links <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>American processed cheese that can be mixed up with anchovies or any fish from whitebait to whale, made like a sausage and sold in handy links.</p><p>Ancien Imperial <em>Normandy, France</em></p><p>Soft; fresh cream; white, mellow and creamy like Neufchatel and made in the same way.

Named from its home town, Barberey, near Troyes, whose name it also bears. Fresh, warm milk is coagulated by rennet in four hours. Uncut curd then goes into a wooden mold with a perforated bottom, to drain three hours, before being finished off in an earthenware mold. The cheeses are salted, dried and ripened three weeks in a cave. The season is from November to May and when made in summer they are often sold fresh.</p><p>Barboux <em>France</em></p><p>Soft.</p><p>Baronet <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>A natural product, mild and mellow.</p><p>Barron <em>France</em></p><p>Soft.</p><p>Bassillac <em>see</em> Bleu.</p><p>Bath <em>England</em></p><p>Gently made, lightly salted, drained on a straw mat in the historic resort town of Bath.

The &quot;wheel&quot; is only sixteen inches in diameter and four inches high, weighing forty to eighty pounds. The cooking of the curd is done at a little lower temperature than Emmentaler, it ripens more rapidly--in four months --and is somewhat softer, but has the same holes and creamy though sharp, full nutty flavor.</p><p>Bauden (<em>see also</em> Koppen) <em>Germany, Austria, Bohemia and Silesia</em></p><p>Semisoft, sour milk, hand type, made in herders&#39; mountain huts in about the same way as Harzkaese, though it is bigger.

This fine, aromatic cheese is considered by many as the very best to eat while drinking beer. But in Germany Bierkaese is more apt to be dissolved in a glass or stein of beer, much as we mix malted powder in milk, and drunk with it, rather than eaten.</p><p>Beer-Regis <em>Dorsetshire, England</em></p><p>This sounds like another beer cheese, but it&#39;s only a mild Cheddar named after its hometown in Dorsetshire.</p><p>Beist-Cheese <em>Scotland</em></p><p>A curiosity of the old days. &quot;The first milk after a calving, boiled or baked to a thick consistency, the result somewhat resembling new-made cheese, though this is clearly not a true cheese.&quot; (MacNeill)</p><p>Belarno <em>Italy</em></p><p>Hard; goat; creamy dessert cheese.</p><p>Belgian Cooked <em>Belgium</em></p><p>The milk, which has been allowed to curdle spontaneously, is skimmed and allowed to drain. When dry it is thoroughly kneaded by hand and is allowed to undergo fermentation, which takes ordinarily from ten to fourteen days in winter and six to eight days in summer. When the fermentation is complete, cream and salt are added and the mixture is heated slowly and stirred until homogeneous, when it is put into molds and allowed to ripen for eight days longer. A cheese ordinarily weighs about three-and-a-half pounds. It is not essentially different from other forms of cooked cheese.</p><p>Beli Sir <em>see</em> Domaci.</p><p>Bellelay, Tete de Moine, or Monk&#39;s Head <em>Switzerland</em></p><p>Soft, buttery, semisharp spread. Sweet milk is coagulated with rennet in twenty to thirty minutes, the curd cut fairly fine and cooked not so firm as Emmentaler, but firmer than Limburger. After being pressed, the cheeses are wrapped in bark for a couple of weeks until they can stand alone. Since no eyes are desired in the cheeses, they are ripened in a moist cellar at a lowish temperature. They take a year to ripen and will keep three or four years. The diameter is seven inches, the weight nine to fifteen pounds. The monk&#39;s head after cutting is kept wrapped in a napkin soaked in white wine and the soft, creamy spread is scraped out to &quot;butter&quot; bread and snacks that go with more white wine. Such combinations of old wine and old cheese suggest monkish influence, which began here in the fifteenth century with the jolly friars of the Canton of Bern. There it is still made exclusively and not exported, for there&#39;s never quite enough to go around.</p><p>Bel Paese <em>Italy</em></p><p><em>See under</em> Foreign Greats, Chapter 3. <em>Also see</em> Mel Fino, a blend, and Bel Paese types--French Boudanne and German Saint Stefano.

Also sold &quot;green,&quot; young and innocent, at the age of ten to eleven days when weighing about that many pounds. Since it has little keeping qualities it should be eaten quickly. Welsh miners eat a lot of it, think it specially suited to their needs, because it is easily digested and does not produce so much heat in the body as long-keeping cheeses.</p><p>Caillebottes (Curds) <em>France--Anjou, Poitou, Saintonge &amp; Vendee</em></p><p>Soft, creamy, sweetened fresh or sour milk clabbered with chardonnette, wild artichoke seed, over slow fire.

Other sharp seasonings besides the brandy or wine make this one of the strongest of French strong cheeses, similar to Fromage Fort.</p><p>Canestrato <em>Sicily, Italy</em></p><p>Hard; mixed goat and sheep; yellow and strong. Takes one year to mature and is very popular both in Sicily where it is made to perfection and in Southern Colorado where it is imitated by and for Italian settlers.</p><p>Cantal, Fromage de Cantal, Auvergne or Auvergne Bleu; also Fourme and La Tome. <em>Auvergne, France</em></p><p>Semihard; smooth; mellow; a kind of Cheddar, lightly colored lemon; yellow; strong, sharp taste but hardly any smell. Forty to a hundred-twenty pound cylinders. The rich milk from highland pastures is more or less skimmed and, being a very old variety, it is still made most primitively. Cured six weeks or six months, and when very old it&#39;s very hard and very sharp. A Cantal type is Laguiole or Guiole.</p><p>Capitanata <em>Italy</em></p><p>Sheep.</p><p>Caprian <em>Capri, Italy</em></p><p>Made from milk of goats that still overrun the original Goat Island, and tangy as a buck.</p><p>Caprino (Little Goat) <em>Argentina</em></p><p>Semihard; goat; sharp; table cheese.</p><p>Caraway Loaf <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>This is just one imitation of dozens of German caraway-seeded cheeses that roam the world. In Germany there is not only Kuemmel loaf cheese but a loaf of caraway-seeded bread to go with it. Milwaukee has long made a good Kuemmelkaese or hand cheese and it would take more than the fingers on both hands to enumerate all of the European originals, from Dutch Komynkaas through Danish King Christian IX and Norwegian Kuminost, Italian Freisa, Pomeranian Rinnen and Belgian Leyden, to Pennsylvania Pot.</p><p>Cardiga, Queijo da <em>Portugal</em></p><p>Hard; sheep; oily; mild flavor. Named from cardo, cardoon in English, a kind of thistle used as a vegetable rennet in making several other cheeses, such as French Caillebottes curdled with chardonnette, wild artichoke seed. Only classical Greek sheep cheeses like Casera can compare with the superb ones from the Portuguese mountain districts. They are lusciously oily, but never rancidly so.</p><p>Carlsbad <em>Bohemia</em></p><p>Semihard; sheep; white; slightly salted; expensive.</p><p>Carre Affine <em>France</em></p><p>Soft, delicate, in small square forms; similar to Petit Carre and Ancien Imperial (<em>see</em>).</p><p>Carre de l&#39;Est <em>France</em></p><p>Similar to Camembert, and imitated in the U.S.A.</p><p>Cascaval Penir <em>Turkey</em></p><p>Cacciocavallo imitation consumed at home.</p><p>Caseralla <em>Greece</em></p><p>Semisoft; sheep; mellow; creamy.</p><p>Casere <em>Greece</em></p><p>Hard; sheep; brittle; gray and greasy.

Superb with wild strawberries; almost a cream cheese by itself. Devonshire cream is made into a luscious cheese ripened on straw, which gives it a special flavor, such as that of French Foin or Hay cheese.</p><p>Dolce Verde <em>Italy</em></p><p>This creamy blue-vein variety is named Sweet Green, because cheesemongers are color-blind when it comes to the blue-greens and the green-blues.</p><p>Domaci Beli Sir <em>Yugoslavia</em></p><p>&quot;Sir&quot; is not a title but the word for cheese.

They are made throughout France in season and are much in demand.</p><p>Dresdener Bierkaese <em>Germany</em></p><p>A celebrated hand cheese made in Dresden. The typical soft, skim milker, strong with caraway and drunk dissolved in beer, as well as merely eaten.</p><p>Drinking cheeses</p><p>Not only Dresdener, but dozens of regional hand cheeses in Germanic countries are melted in steins of beer or glasses of wine to make distinctive cheesed drinks for strong stomachs and noses.

It is an extremely simple product, made for home consumption and only in the winter season, when the milk cannot be profitably used for other purposes. As soon as the milk is skimmed it is put into a large kettle which can be swung over a fire, where it is kept warm until it is thoroughly thickened from souring. It is then broken up and cooked quite firm. A small quantity of salt and sometimes some caraway seed are added, and the curd is put into forms of various sizes. It is then placed in a drying room, where it becomes very hard, when it is ready for eating.&quot; (From U.S. Department of Agriculture <em>Bulletin</em> No. 608.)</p><p>Dubreala <em>see</em> Brina.</p><p>Duel <em>Austria</em></p><p>Soft; skim milk; hand type; two by two by one-inch cube.</p><p>Dunlop <em>Scotland</em></p><p>One of the national cheeses of Scotland, but now far behind Cheddar, which it resembles, although it is closer in texture and moister.

One of the few cheeses made by adding eggs to the curds. Others are Dutch Cream Cheese of England; German Dotter; French Fromage Cuit (cooked cheese), and Westphalian. Authorities agree that these should be labeled &quot;egg cheese&quot; so the buyers won&#39;t be fooled by their richness. The Finns age their eggs even as the Chinese ripen their hundred-year-old eggs, by burying them in grain, as all Scandinavians do, and the Scotch as well, in the oat bin. But none of them is left a century to ripen, as eggs are said to be in China.</p><p>Elbinger, or Elbing <em>West Prussia</em></p><p>Hard; crumbly; sharp.

The wedge shape is used, however, <em>without any rind</em>, to make processed pastes pass for &quot;natural&quot; even without that identifying word, and with misleading labels such as old, sharp Cheddar and &quot;aged nine months.&quot; That&#39;s long enough to make a baby, but not a &quot;natural&quot; out of a processed &quot;Cheddar.&quot;</p><p>Pimiento <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>Because pimiento is the blandest of peppers, it just suits our bland national taste, especially when mixed with Neufchatel, cream, club or cottage.

During the mixing, salt and sometimes caraway seed are added. The cheese is allowed to stand for from two to four days while a fermentation takes place. After this the curd is sometimes covered with beer or cream and is finally placed in tubs and allowed to ripen for fourteen days. A variety of this cheese is made in the U.S. It is probable, however, that it is not allowed to ripen for quite so long a period as the potato cheese of Europe.

According to an old English recipe the curds are collected with an ordinary fish-slice and placed in a rush shape, covered with a cloth when filled. Lay a half-pound weight in a saucer and set this on top of the strained curd for a few hours, and then increase the weight by about a half pound. Change the cloths daily until the cheese looks mellow, then put into the rush shape with the fish slice. The formula in use in France, where willow heart-shape baskets are sold for making this cheese, is as follows: Add one cup new warm milk to two cups freshly-skimmed cream. Dissolve in this one teaspoon of fine sugar and one tablespoon common rennet or thirty drops of Hauser&#39;s extract of rennet. Let it remain in a warm place until curd sets.

A soft cream cheese can be obtained at some farms, and sometimes holds the same delicate melting sensuousness that is found in the poems of John Keats.</p><p>&quot;The &#39;Resurrection Cheese&#39; of Llanfihangel Abercowyn is no longer available, at least under that name. This cheese was so called because it was pressed by gravestones taken from an old church that had fallen into ruins. Often enough the cheeses would be inscribed with such wording as &#39;Here lies Blodwen Evans, aged 72.&#39;&quot; (From <em>My Wales</em> by Rhys Davies.)</p><p>Wensleydale <em>England</em></p><p>I. England, Yorkshire. Hard; blue-veined; double cream; similar to Stilton. This production of the medieval town of Wensleydale in the Ure Valley is also called Yorkshire-Stilton and is in season from June to September. It is put up in the same cylindrical form as Stilton, but smaller. The rind is corrugated from the way the wrapping is put on.</p><p>II. White; flat-shaped; eaten fresh; made mostly from January through the Spring, skipping the season when the greater No. I is made (throughout the summer) and beginning to be made again in the fall and winter.</p><p>Werder, Elbinger and Niederungskaese <em>West Prussia</em></p><p>Semisoft cow&#39;s-milker, mildly acid, shaped like Gouda.</p><p>West Friesian <em>Netherlands</em></p><p>Skim-milk cheese eaten when only a week old. The honored antiquity of it is preserved in the anonymous English couplet:</p><pre><code>Good bread, good butter and good cheese
Is good English and good Friese.
</code></pre><p>Westphalia Sour Milk, or Brioler <em>Germany</em></p><p>Sour-milk hand cheese, kneaded by hand. Butter and/or egg yolk is mixed in with salt, and either pepper or caraway seeds. Then the richly colored curd is shaped by hand into small balls or rolls of about one pound. It is dried for a couple of hours before being put down cellar to ripen. The peculiar flavor is due partly to the seasonings and partly to the curd being allowed to putrify a little, like Limburger, before pressing.</p><p>This sour-milker is as celebrated as Westphalian raw ham. It is so soft and fat it makes a sumptuous spread, similar to Tilsit and Brinza. It was named Brioler from the &quot;Gute Brioler&quot; inn where it was perfected by the owner, Frau Westphal, well over a century ago.</p><p>The English sometimes miscall it Bristol from a Hobson-Jobson of the name Briol.</p><p>Whale Cheese <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>In _The Cheddar Box, _Dean Collins tells of an ancient legend in which the whales came into Tillamook Bay to be milked; and he poses the possible origin of some waxy fossilized deposits along the shore as petrified whale-milk cheese made by the aboriginal Indians after milking the whales.</p><p>White, Fromage Blanc <em>France</em></p><p>Skim-milk summer cheese made in many parts of the country and eaten fresh, with or without salt.</p><p>White Cheddar <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>Any Cheddar that isn&#39;t colored with anatto is known as White Cheddar. Green Bay brand is a fine example of it.</p><p>White Gorgonzola</p><p>This type without the distinguishing blue veins is little known outside of Italy where it is highly esteemed. (<em>See</em> Gorgonzola.)</p><p>White Stilton <em>England</em></p><p>This white form of England&#39;s royal blue cheese lacks the aristocratic veins that are really as green as Ireland&#39;s flag.</p><p>Whitethorn <em>Ireland</em></p><p>Firm; white; tangy; half-pound slabs boxed. Saltee is the same, except that it is colored.</p><p>Wilstermarsch-Kaese Holsteiner Marsch <em>Schleswig-Holstein, Germany</em></p><p>Semihard; full cream; rapidly cured; Tilsit type; very fine; made at Itzehoe.</p><p>Wiltshire or Wilts <em>England</em></p><p>A Derbyshire type of sharp Cheddar popular in Wiltshire. (<em>See</em> North Wilts.)</p><p>Wisconsin Factory Cheeses <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>Have the date of manufacture stamped on the rind, indicating by the age whether the flavor is &quot;mild, mellow, nippy, or sharp.&quot; American Cheddar requires from eight months to a year to ripen properly, but most of it is sold green when far too young.</p><p>Notable Wisconsiners are Loaf, Limburger, Redskin and Swiss.</p><p>Withania <em>India</em></p><p>Cow taboos affect the cheesemaking in India, and in place of rennet from calves a vegetable rennet is made from withania berries. This names a cheese of agreeable flavor when ripened, but, unfortunately, it becomes acrid with age.</p><p>Y</p><p>Yoghurt, or Yogurt <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>Made with <em>Bacillus bulgaricus</em>, that develops the acidity of the milk. It is similar to the English Saint Ivel.</p><p>York, York Curd and Cambridge York <em>England</em></p><p>A high-grade cream cheese similar to Slipcote, both of which are becoming almost extinct since World War II. Also, this type is too rich to keep any length of time and is sold on the straw mat on which it is cured, for local consumption.</p><p>Yorkshire-Stilton <em>Cotherstone, England</em></p><p>This Stilton, made chiefly at Cotherstone, develops with age a fine internal fat which makes it so extra-juicy that it&#39;s a general favorite with English epicures who like their game well hung.</p><p>York State <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>Short for New York State, the most venerable of our Cheddars.</p><p>Young America <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>A mild, young, yellow Cheddar.</p><p>Yo-yo <em>U.S.A.</em></p><p>Copying pear-and apple-shaped balls of Italian Provolone hanging on strings, a New York cheesemonger put out a Cheddar on a string, shaped like a yo-yo.</p><p>Z</p><p>Ziegel <em>Austria</em></p><p>Whole milk, or whole milk with cream added. Aged only two months.</p><p>Ziegenkaese <em>Germany</em></p><p>A general name in Germanic lands for cheeses made of goat&#39;s milk. Altenburger is a leader among Ziegenkaese.</p><p>Ziger</p><p>I. This whey product is not a true cheese, but a cheap form of food made in all countries of central Europe and called albumin cheese, Recuit, Ricotta, Broccio, Brocotte, Serac, Ceracee, etc. Some are flavored with cider and others with vinegar. There is also a whey bread.</p><p>II. Similar to Corsican Broccio and made of sour sheep milk instead of whey. Sometimes mixed with sugar into small cakes.</p><p>Zips <em>see</em> Brinza.</p><p>Zomma <em>Turkey</em></p><p>Similar to Caciocavallo.</p><p>Zwirn <em>see</em> Tschil.</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p>Index of Recipes</p><p>American Cheese Salad, 128 Angelic Camembert, 120 Apple and Cheese Salad, 130 Apple Pie a la Cheese, 119 Apple Pie Adorned, 119 Apple Pie, Cheese-crusty, 119 Asparagus and Cheese, Italian, 110 au Gratin Eggs, 125 Potatoes, 125 Tomatoes, 125</p><p>Blintzes, 111 Brie or Camembert Salad, 128</p><p>Camembert, Angelic, 120 Champagned Roquefort or Gorgonzola, 122 Cheddar Omelet, 135 Cheese and Nut Salad, 128 Cheese and Pea Salad, 130 Cheese Cake, Pineapple, 117 Cheese Charlotte, 133 Cheese-crusty Apple Pie, 119 Cheese Custard, 118 Cheese Pie, Open-faced, 118 Cheese Sauce, Plain, 131 Cheese Waffles, 112 Cheesed Mashed Potatoes, 137 Chicken Cheese Soup, 127 Cottage Cheese Pancakes, 112 Christmas Cake Sandwiches, 120 Cold Dunking, 133 Custard, Cheese, 118</p><p>Dauphiny Ravioli, 109 Diablotins, 135 Dumpling, Napkin, 112 Dunking, Cold, 133</p><p>Eggs au Gratin, 125</p><p>Flan au Fromage, 119 Fondue a l&#39;Italienne, 84 All-American, 85 au Fromage, 90 Baked Tomato, 89 Brick, 92 Catsup Tummy Fondiddy, Quickie, 91 Cheddar Dunk Bowl, 93 Cheese, 92 Cheese, and Corn, 92 Cheese and Rice, 91 Chives, 88 Comtois, 88 Corn and Cheese, 92 Neufchatel Style, 82 100% American, 90 Parmesan, 86 Quickie Catsup Tummy Fondiddy, 91 Rice, and Cheese, 91 Sapsago Swiss, 86 Tomato, 89 Tomato Baked, 89 Vacherin-Fribourg, 88 Fritters, Italian, 109 Fritto Misto, Italian, 137</p><p>Garlic on Cheese, 110 Gorgonzola and Banana Salad, 129 Green Cheese Salad Julienne, 127</p><p>Italian Asparagus and Cheese, 110 Italian Fritters, 109 Italian Fritto Misto, 137 Italian-Swiss Scallopini, 108</p><p>Little Hats, Cappelletti, 108</p><p>Meal-in-One Omelet, A, 135 Miniature Pizzas, 107</p><p>Napkin Dumpling, 112 Neapolitan Baked Lasagne, 108</p><p>Omelet Cheddar, 135 Meal-in-One, 135 Parmesan, 135 Tomato, 136 with Cheese Sauce, 136 Onion Soup, 126 Onion Soup au Gratin, 126 Open-faced Cheese Pie, 118</p><p>Pancakes, Cottage Cheese, 112 Parmesan Omelet, 135 Parsleyed Cheese Sauce, 131 Pfeffernuesse and Caraway, 134 Pineapple Cheese Cake, 117 Piroghs, Polish, 137 Pizza, 106 Cheese, 107 Dough, 106 Miniature, 107 Tomato Paste, 107 Polish Piroghs, 137 Potatoes au Gratin, 125 Potatoes, Mashed, Cheesed, 137 Puffs Breakfast, 100 Cheese, New England, 100 Cream Cheese, 100 Danish Fondue, 100 Fried, 99 New England Cheese, 100 Parmesan, 99 Roquefort, 99 Three-in-One, 98</p><p>Rabbit After-Dinner, 55 All-American Succotash, 77 American Woodchuck, 63 Anchovy, 70 Asparagus, 68 Basic No. 1 (with beer), 49 No. 2 (with milk), 50 Blushing Bunny, 63 Border-hopping Bunny, 60 &quot;Bouquet of the Sea,&quot;

</code></pre><p>Bob Brown, after living thirty years in as many foreign lands and enjoying countless national cheeses at the source, returned to New York and summed them all up in this book.</p><p>Born in Chicago, he was graduated from Oak Park High School and entered the University of Wisconsin at the exact moment when a number of imported Swiss professors in this great dairy state began teaching their students how to hole an Emmentaler.</p><p>After majoring in beer and free lunch from Milwaukee to Munich, Bob celebrated the end of Prohibition with a book called <em>Let There Be Beer!</em> and then decided to write another about Beer&#39;s best friend, Cheese. But first he collaborated with his mother Cora and wife Rose on <em>The Wine Cookbook</em>, still in print after nearly twenty-five years. This first manual on the subject in America paced a baker&#39;s dozen food-and-drink books, including: <em>America Cooks, 10,000 Snacks, Fish and Seafood</em> and <em>The South American Cookbook</em>.</p><p>For ten years he published his own weekly magazines in Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City and London. In the decade before that, from 1907 to 1917, he wrote more than a thousand short stories and serials under his full name, Robert Carlton Brown. One of his first books, <em>What Happened to Mary</em>, became a best seller and was the first five-reel movie. This put him in <em>Who&#39;s Who</em> in his early twenties.</p><p>In 1928 he retired to write and travel. After a couple of years spent in collecting books and bibelots throughout the Orient, he settled down in Paris with the expatriate group of Americans and invented the Reading Machine for their delectation. Nancy Cunard published his <em>Words</em> and Harry Crosby printed <em>1450-1950</em> at the Black Sun Press, while in Cagnes-sur-Mer Bob had his own imprint Roving Eye Press, that turned out <em>Demonics; Gems, a Censored Anthology; Globe-gliding</em> and <em>Readies for Bob Brown&#39;s Machine</em> with contributions by Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, Kay Boyle, James T. Farrell <em>et al.</em></p><p>The depression drove him back to New York, but a decade later he returned to Brazil that had long been his home away from home. There he wrote <em>The Amazing Amazon</em>, with his wife Rose, making a total of thirty books bearing his name.</p><p>After the death of his wife and mother, Bob Brown closed their mountain home in Petropolis, Brazil, and returned to New York where he remarried and now lives, in the Greenwich Village of his free-lancing youth. With him came the family&#39;s working library in a score of trunks and boxes, that formed the basis of a mail-order book business in which he specializes today in food, drink and other out-of-the-way items.</p><p>[Compiler&#39;s Notes: Moved what was page 1 of project past title page, removed publisher&#39;s copyright information from page 3.
