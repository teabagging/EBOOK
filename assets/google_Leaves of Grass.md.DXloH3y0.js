 Such verses for my Body let us write, (for we are one,)
 That should I after return,
 Or, long, long hence, in other spheres,
 There to some group of mates the chants resuming,
 (Tallying Earth&#39;s soil, trees, winds, tumultuous waves,)
 Ever with pleas&#39;d smile I may keep on,
 Ever and ever yet the verses owning--as, first, I here and now
 Signing for Soul and Body, set to them my name,

INSCRIPTIONS</p><p>One&#39;s-Self I Sing</p><p>One&#39;s-self I sing, a simple separate person, Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.</p><p>Of physiology from top to toe I sing, Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say the Form complete is worthier far, The Female equally with the Male I sing.</p><p>Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power, Cheerful, for freest action form&#39;d under the laws divine, The Modern Man I sing.</p><p>As I Ponder&#39;d in Silence</p><p>As I ponder&#39;d in silence, Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long, A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect, Terrible in beauty, age, and power, The genius of poets of old lands, As to me directing like flame its eyes, With finger pointing to many immortal songs, And menacing voice, What singest thou? it said, Know&#39;st thou not there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards? And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles, The making of perfect soldiers.</p><p>Be it so, then I answer&#39;d, I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any, Waged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance and retreat, victory deferr&#39;d and wavering, (Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the field the world, For life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul, Lo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles, I above all promote brave soldiers.</p><p>In Cabin&#39;d Ships at Sea</p><p>In cabin&#39;d ships at sea, The boundless blue on every side expanding, With whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves, Or some lone bark buoy&#39;d on the dense marine, Where joyous full of faith, spreading white sails, She cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under many a star at night, By sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read, In full rapport at last.</p><p>Here are our thoughts, voyagers&#39; thoughts, Here not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said, The sky o&#39;erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet, We feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion, The tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables, The perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm, The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here, And this is ocean&#39;s poem.</p><p>Then falter not O book, fulfil your destiny, You not a reminiscence of the land alone, You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos&#39;d I know not whither, yet ever full of faith, Consort to every ship that sails, sail you! Bear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it here in every leaf;) Speed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the imperious waves, Chant on, sail on, bear o&#39;er the boundless blue from me to every sea, This song for mariners and all their ships.</p><p>To Foreign Lands</p><p>I heard that you ask&#39;d for something to prove this puzzle the New World, And to define America, her athletic Democracy, Therefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted.</p><p>To a Historian</p><p>You who celebrate bygones, Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races, the life that has exhibited itself, Who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers and priests, I, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself in his own rights, Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, (the great pride of man in himself,) Chanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be, I project the history of the future.</p><p>To Thee Old Cause</p><p>To thee old cause! Thou peerless, passionate, good cause, Thou stern, remorseless, sweet idea, Deathless throughout the ages, races, lands, After a strange sad war, great war for thee, (I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be really fought, for thee,) These chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.</p><p>(A war O soldiers not for itself alone, Far, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this book.)</p><p>Thou orb of many orbs! Thou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre! Around the idea of thee the war revolving, With all its angry and vehement play of causes, (With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years,) These recitatives for thee,--my book and the war are one, Merged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee, As a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself, Around the idea of thee.</p><p>Eidolons</p><pre><code>   I met a seer,

And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life? (As if any man really knew aught of my life, Why even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life, Only a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections I seek for my own use to trace out here.)</p><p>Beginning My Studies</p><p>Beginning my studies the first step pleas&#39;d me so much, The mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion, The least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love, The first step I say awed me and pleas&#39;d me so much, I have hardly gone and hardly wish&#39;d to go any farther, But stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.</p><p>Beginners</p><p>How they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals,) How dear and dreadful they are to the earth, How they inure to themselves as much as to any--what a paradox appears their age, How people respond to them, yet know them not, How there is something relentless in their fate all times, How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward, And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same great purchase.</p><p>To the States</p><p>To the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist much, obey little, Once unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved, Once fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth, ever afterward resumes its liberty.</p><p>On Journeys Through the States</p><p>On journeys through the States we start, (Ay through the world, urged by these songs, Sailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,) We willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.</p><p>We have watch&#39;d the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on, And have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the seasons, and effuse as much?</p><p>We dwell a while in every city and town, We pass through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the Mississippi, and the Southern States, We confer on equal terms with each of the States, We make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear, We say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the body and the soul, Dwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic, And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return, And may be just as much as the seasons.</p><p>To a Certain Cantatrice</p><p>Here, take this gift, I was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general, One who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the progress and freedom of the race, Some brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel; But I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any.</p><p>Me Imperturbe</p><p>Me imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature, Master of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things, Imbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they, Finding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less important than I thought, Me toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee, or far north or inland, A river man, or a man of the woods or of any farm-life of these States or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada, Me wherever my life is lived, O to be self-balanced for contingencies, To confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as the trees and animals do.</p><p>Savantism</p><p>Thither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and nestling close, always obligated, Thither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts, establishments, even the most minute, Thither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates; Thither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant, As a father to his father going takes his children along with him.</p><p>The Ship Starting</p><p>Lo, the unbounded sea, On its breast a ship starting, spreading all sails, carrying even her moonsails. The pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately-- below emulous waves press forward, They surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam.</p><p>I Hear America Singing</p><p>I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear, Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong, The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam, The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work, The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck, The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands, The wood-cutter&#39;s song, the ploughboy&#39;s on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown, The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing, Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else, The day what belongs to the day--at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly, Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.</p><p>What Place Is Besieged?</p><p>What place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege? Lo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal, And with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery, And artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun.</p><p>Still Though the One I Sing</p><p>Still though the one I sing, (One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to Nationality, I leave in him revolt, (O latent right of insurrection! O quenchless, indispensable fire!)</p><p>Shut Not Your Doors</p><p>Shut not your doors to me proud libraries, For that which was lacking on all your well-fill&#39;d shelves, yet needed most, I bring, Forth from the war emerging, a book I have made, The words of my book nothing, the drift of it every thing, A book separate, not link&#39;d with the rest nor felt by the intellect, But you ye untold latencies will thrill to every page.</p><p>Poets to Come</p><p>Poets to come! orators, singers, musicians to come! Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for, But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than before known, Arouse! for you must justify me.</p><p>I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future, I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.</p><p>I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping, turns a casual look upon you and then averts his face, Leaving it to you to prove and define it, Expecting the main things from you.</p><p>To You</p><p>Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why should you not speak to me? And why should I not speak to you?</p><p>Thou Reader</p><p>Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I, Therefore for thee the following chants.</p><p>BOOK II</p><p>Starting from Paumanok</p><pre><code>   1
</code></pre><p>Starting from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born, Well-begotten, and rais&#39;d by a perfect mother, After roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements, Dweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas, Or a soldier camp&#39;d or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a miner in California, Or rude in my home in Dakota&#39;s woods, my diet meat, my drink from the spring, Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess, Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy, Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of mighty Niagara, Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and strong-breasted bull, Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain, snow, my amaze, Having studied the mocking-bird&#39;s tones and the flight of the mountain-hawk, And heard at dawn the unrivall&#39;d one, the hermit thrush from the swamp-cedars, Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.</p><pre><code>   2
</code></pre><p>Victory, union, faith, identity, time, The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery, Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports. This then is life, Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.</p><p>How curious! how real! Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.</p><p>See revolving the globe, The ancestor-continents away group&#39;d together, The present and future continents north and south, with the isthmus between.</p><p>See, vast trackless spaces, As in a dream they change, they swiftly fill, Countless masses debouch upon them, They are now cover&#39;d with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known.</p><p>See, projected through time, For me an audience interminable.</p><p>With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop, Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions, One generation playing its part and passing on, Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn, With faces turn&#39;d sideways or backward towards me to listen, With eyes retrospective towards me.</p><pre><code>   3
</code></pre><p>Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian! Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses! For you a programme of chants.</p><p>Chants of the prairies, Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea, Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas, and thence equidistant, Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all.</p><pre><code>   4
</code></pre><p>Take my leaves America, take them South and take them North, Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own off-spring, Surround them East and West, for they would surround you, And you precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they connect lovingly with you.</p><p>I conn&#39;d old times, I sat studying at the feet of the great masters, Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.</p><p>In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique? Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.</p><pre><code>   5
</code></pre><p>Dead poets, philosophs, priests, Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since, Language-shapers on other shores, Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate, I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left wafted hither, I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it,) Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more than it deserves, Regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it, I stand in my place with my own day here.</p><p>Here lands female and male, Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the flame of materials, Here spirituality the translatress, the openly-avow&#39;d, The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms, The satisfier, after due long-waiting now advancing, Yes here comes my mistress the soul.</p><pre><code>   6
</code></pre><p>The soul, Forever and forever--longer than soil is brown and solid--longer than water ebbs and flows. I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems, And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality, For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and of immortality.</p><p>I will make a song for these States that no one State may under any circumstances be subjected to another State, And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by night between all the States, and between any two of them, And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of weapons with menacing points, And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces; And a song make I of the One form&#39;d out of all, The fang&#39;d and glittering One whose head is over all, Resolute warlike One including and over all, (However high the head of any else that head is over all.)</p><p>I will acknowledge contemporary lands, I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously every city large and small, And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is heroism upon land and sea, And I will report all heroism from an American point of view.</p><p>I will sing the song of companionship, I will show what alone must finally compact these, I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love, indicating it in me, I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were threatening to consume me, I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires, I will give them complete abandonment, I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love, For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy? And who but I should be the poet of comrades?</p><pre><code>   7
</code></pre><p>I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races, I advance from the people in their own spirit, Here is what sings unrestricted faith.</p><p>Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may, I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also, I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is--and I say there is in fact no evil, (Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land or to me, as any thing else.)</p><p>I too, following many and follow&#39;d by many, inaugurate a religion, I descend into the arena, (It may be I am destin&#39;d to utter the loudest cries there, the winner&#39;s pealing shouts, Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.)</p><p>Each is not for its own sake, I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion&#39;s sake.</p><p>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough, None has ever yet adored or worship&#39;d half enough, None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the future is.</p><p>I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be their religion, Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur; (Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion, Nor land nor man or woman without religion.)</p><pre><code>   8
</code></pre><p>What are you doing young man? Are you so earnest, so given up to literature, science, art, amours? These ostensible realities, politics, points? Your ambition or business whatever it may be?</p><p>It is well--against such I say not a word, I am their poet also, But behold! such swiftly subside, burnt up for religion&#39;s sake, For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of the earth, Any more than such are to religion.</p><pre><code>   9
</code></pre><p>What do you seek so pensive and silent? What do you need camerado? Dear son do you think it is love?</p><p>Listen dear son--listen America, daughter or son, It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess, and yet it satisfies, it is great, But there is something else very great, it makes the whole coincide, It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands sweeps and provides for all.</p><pre><code>   10
</code></pre><p>Know you, solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion, The following chants each for its kind I sing.</p><p>My comrade! For you to share with me two greatnesses, and a third one rising inclusive and more resplendent, The greatness of Love and Democracy, and the greatness of Religion.</p><p>Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen, Mysterious ocean where the streams empty, Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me, Living beings, identities now doubtless near us in the air that we know not of, Contact daily and hourly that will not release me, These selecting, these in hints demanded of me.</p><p>Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me, Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him, Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual world, After what they have done to me, suggesting themes.</p><p>O such themes--equalities! O divine average! Warblings under the sun, usher&#39;d as now, or at noon, or setting, Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither, I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them, and cheerfully pass them forward.</p><pre><code>   11
</code></pre><p>As I have walk&#39;d in Alabama my morning walk, I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird sat on her nest in the briers hatching her brood.</p><p>I have seen the he-bird also, I have paus&#39;d to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and joyfully singing.</p><p>And while I paus&#39;d it came to me that what he really sang for was not there only, Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes, But subtle, clandestine, away beyond, A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.</p><pre><code>   12
</code></pre><p>Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing.</p><p>Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us, For those who belong here and those to come, I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.</p><p>I will make the songs of passion to give them their way, And your songs outlaw&#39;d offenders, for I scan you with kindred eyes, and carry you with me the same as any.</p><p>I will make the true poem of riches, To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward and is not dropt by death; I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be the bard of personality, And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other, And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I am determin&#39;d to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you illustrious, And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present, and can be none in the future, And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn&#39;d to beautiful results, And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death, And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact, And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound as any.</p><p>I will not make poems with reference to parts, But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble, And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all days, And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has reference to the soul, Because having look&#39;d at the objects of the universe, I find there is no one nor any particle of one but has reference to the soul.</p><pre><code>   13
</code></pre><p>Was somebody asking to see the soul? See, your own shape and countenance, persons, substances, beasts, the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands.</p><p>All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them; How can the real body ever die and be buried?</p><p>Of your real body and any man&#39;s or woman&#39;s real body, Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners and pass to fitting spheres, Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death.</p><p>Not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the meaning, the main concern, Any more than a man&#39;s substance and life or a woman&#39;s substance and life return in the body and the soul, Indifferently before death and after death.</p><p>Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern and includes and is the soul; Whoever you are, how superb and how divine is your body, or any part of it!</p><pre><code>   14

To drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous! To court destruction with taunts, with invitations! To ascend, to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me! To rise thither with my inebriate soul! To be lost if it must be so! To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom! With one brief hour of madness and joy.</p><p>Out of the Rolling Ocean the Crowd</p><p>Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me, Whispering I love you, before long I die, I have travel&#39;d a long way merely to look on you to touch you, For I could not die till I once look&#39;d on you, For I fear&#39;d I might afterward lose you.</p><p>Now we have met, we have look&#39;d, we are safe, Return in peace to the ocean my love, I too am part of that ocean my love, we are not so much separated, Behold the great rondure, the cohesion of all, how perfect! But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us, As for an hour carrying us diverse, yet cannot carry us diverse forever; Be not impatient--a little space--know you I salute the air, the ocean and the land, Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love.</p><p>Ages and Ages Returning at Intervals</p><p>Ages and ages returning at intervals, Undestroy&#39;d, wandering immortal, Lusty, phallic, with the potent original loins, perfectly sweet, I, chanter of Adamic songs, Through the new garden the West, the great cities calling, Deliriate, thus prelude what is generated, offering these, offering myself, Bathing myself, bathing my songs in Sex, Offspring of my loins.</p><p>We Two, How Long We Were Fool&#39;d</p><p>We two, how long we were fool&#39;d, Now transmuted, we swiftly escape as Nature escapes, We are Nature, long have we been absent, but now we return, We become plants, trunks, foliage, roots, bark, We are bedded in the ground, we are rocks, We are oaks, we grow in the openings side by side, We browse, we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any, We are two fishes swimming in the sea together, We are what locust blossoms are, we drop scent around lanes mornings and evenings, We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals, We are two predatory hawks, we soar above and look down, We are two resplendent suns, we it is who balance ourselves orbic and stellar, we are as two comets, We prowl fang&#39;d and four-footed in the woods, we spring on prey, We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead, We are seas mingling, we are two of those cheerful waves rolling over each other and interwetting each other, We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious, impervious, We are snow, rain, cold, darkness, we are each product and influence of the globe, We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we two, We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy.</p><p>O Hymen! O Hymenee!</p><p>O hymen! O hymenee! why do you tantalize me thus? O why sting me for a swift moment only? Why can you not continue? O why do you now cease? Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would soon certainly kill me?</p><p>I Am He That Aches with Love</p><p>I am he that aches with amorous love; Does the earth gravitate? does not all matter, aching, attract all matter? So the body of me to all I meet or know.</p><p>Native Moments</p><p>Native moments--when you come upon me--ah you are here now, Give me now libidinous joys only, Give me the drench of my passions, give me life coarse and rank, To-day I go consort with Nature&#39;s darlings, to-night too, I am for those who believe in loose delights, I share the midnight orgies of young men, I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers, The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick out some low person for my dearest friend, He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate, he shall be one condemn&#39;d by others for deeds done, I will play a part no longer, why should I exile myself from my companions? O you shunn&#39;d persons, I at least do not shun you, I come forthwith in your midst, I will be your poet, I will be more to you than to any of the rest.</p><p>Once I Pass&#39;d Through a Populous City</p><p>Once I pass&#39;d through a populous city imprinting my brain for future use with its shows, architecture, customs, traditions, Yet now of all that city I remember only a woman I casually met there who detain&#39;d me for love of me, Day by day and night by night we were together--all else has long been forgotten by me, I remember I say only that woman who passionately clung to me, Again we wander, we love, we separate again, Again she holds me by the hand, I must not go, I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous.</p><p>I Heard You Solemn-Sweet Pipes of the Organ</p><p>I heard you solemn-sweet pipes of the organ as last Sunday morn I pass&#39;d the church, Winds of autumn, as I walk&#39;d the woods at dusk I heard your long- stretch&#39;d sighs up above so mournful, I heard the perfect Italian tenor singing at the opera, I heard the soprano in the midst of the quartet singing; Heart of my love! you too I heard murmuring low through one of the wrists around my head, Heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells last night under my ear.</p><p>Facing West from California&#39;s Shores</p><p>Facing west from California&#39;s shores, Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound, I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity, the land of migrations, look afar, Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled; For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere, From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero, From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands, Long having wander&#39;d since, round the earth having wander&#39;d, Now I face home again, very pleas&#39;d and joyous, (But where is what I started for so long ago? And why is it yet unfound?)</p><p>As Adam Early in the Morning</p><p>As Adam early in the morning, Walking forth from the bower refresh&#39;d with sleep, Behold me where I pass, hear my voice, approach, Touch me, touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass, Be not afraid of my body.</p><p>BOOK V. CALAMUS</p><p>In Paths Untrodden</p><p>In paths untrodden, In the growth by margins of pond-waters, Escaped from the life that exhibits itself, From all the standards hitherto publish&#39;d, from the pleasures, profits, conformities, Which too long I was offering to feed my soul, Clear to me now standards not yet publish&#39;d, clear to me that my soul, That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades, Here by myself away from the clank of the world, Tallying and talk&#39;d to here by tongues aromatic, No longer abash&#39;d, (for in this secluded spot I can respond as I would not dare elsewhere,) Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself, yet contains all the rest, Resolv&#39;d to sing no songs to-day but those of manly attachment, Projecting them along that substantial life, Bequeathing hence types of athletic love, Afternoon this delicious Ninth-month in my forty-first year, I proceed for all who are or have been young men, To tell the secret my nights and days, To celebrate the need of comrades.</p><p>Scented Herbage of My Breast</p><p>Scented herbage of my breast, Leaves from you I glean, I write, to be perused best afterwards, Tomb-leaves, body-leaves growing up above me above death, Perennial roots, tall leaves, O the winter shall not freeze you delicate leaves, Every year shall you bloom again, out from where you retired you shall emerge again; O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale your faint odor, but I believe a few will; O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to tell in your own way of the heart that is under you, O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves, you are not happiness, You are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn and sting me, Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots, you make me think of death, Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautiful except death and love?) O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers, I think it must be for death, For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers, Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer, (I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most,) Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same as you mean, Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my breast! Spring away from the conceal&#39;d heart there! Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves! Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast! Come I am determin&#39;d to unbare this broad breast of mine, I have long enough stifled and choked; Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me not, I will say what I have to say by itself, I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter a call only their call, I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States, I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will through the States, Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating, Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it, Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, and are folded inseparably together, you love and death are, Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life, For now it is convey&#39;d to me that you are the purports essential, That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that they are mainly for you, That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality, That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how long, That you will one day perhaps take control of all, That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance, That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very long, But you will last very long.</p><p>Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand</p><p>Whoever you are holding me now in hand, Without one thing all will be useless, I give you fair warning before you attempt me further, I am not what you supposed, but far different.</p><p>Who is he that would become my follower? Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?</p><p>The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive, You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard, Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting, The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon&#39;d, Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let go your hand from my shoulders, Put me down and depart on your way.</p><p>Or else by stealth in some wood for trial, Or back of a rock in the open air, (For in any roof&#39;d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company, And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,) But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares, Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island, Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you, With the comrade&#39;s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband&#39;s kiss, For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.</p><p>Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing, Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip, Carry me when you go forth over land or sea; For thus merely touching you is enough, is best, And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.</p><p>But these leaves conning you con at peril, For these leaves and me you will not understand, They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you. Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold! Already you see I have escaped from you.</p><p>For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book, Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it, Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me, Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove victorious, Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more, For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at; Therefore release me and depart on your way.</p><p>For You, O Democracy</p><p>Come, I will make the continent indissoluble, I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon, I will make divine magnetic lands, With the love of comrades, With the life-long love of comrades.</p><p>I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies, I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other&#39;s necks, By the love of comrades, By the manly love of comrades.</p><p>For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme! For you, for you I am trilling these songs.</p><p>These I Singing in Spring</p><p>These I singing in spring collect for lovers, (For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy? And who but I should be the poet of comrades?) Collecting I traverse the garden the world, but soon I pass the gates, Now along the pond-side, now wading in a little, fearing not the wet, Now by the post-and-rail fences where the old stones thrown there, pick&#39;d from the fields, have accumulated, (Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and partly cover them, beyond these I pass,) Far, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I think where I go, Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence, Alone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me, Some walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck, They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle, Collecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them, Plucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is near me, Here, lilac, with a branch of pine, Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull&#39;d off a live-oak in Florida as it hung trailing down, Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage, And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pondside, (O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns again never to separate from me, And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades, this calamus-root shall, Interchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!) And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut, And stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar, These I compass&#39;d around by a thick cloud of spirits, Wandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me, Indicating to each one what he shall have, giving something to each; But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve, I will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am capable of loving.</p><p>Not Heaving from My Ribb&#39;d Breast Only</p><p>Not heaving from my ribb&#39;d breast only, Not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself, Not in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs, Not in many an oath and promise broken, Not in my wilful and savage soul&#39;s volition, Not in the subtle nourishment of the air, Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists, Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease, Not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only, Not in cries, laughter, defiancies, thrown from me when alone far in the wilds, Not in husky pantings through clinch&#39;d teeth, Not in sounded and resounded words, chattering words, echoes, dead words, Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep, Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day, Nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss you continually--not there, Not in any or all of them O adhesiveness! O pulse of my life! Need I that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs.</p><p>Of the Terrible Doubt of Appearances</p><p>Of the terrible doubt of appearances, Of the uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded, That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after all, That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only, May-be the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills, shining and flowing waters, The skies of day and night, colors, densities, forms, may-be these are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real something has yet to be known, (How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me! How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of them,) May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) as from my present point of view, and might prove (as of course they would) nought of what they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely changed points of view; To me these and the like of these are curiously answer&#39;d by my lovers, my dear friends, When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me by the hand, When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason hold not, surround us and pervade us, Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom, I am silent, I require nothing further, I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity beyond the grave, But I walk or sit indifferent, I am satisfied, He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.</p><p>The Base of All Metaphysics</p><p>And now gentlemen, A word I give to remain in your memories and minds, As base and finale too for all metaphysics.</p><p>(So to the students the old professor, At the close of his crowded course.)</p><p>Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and Germanic systems, Kant having studied and stated, Fichte and Schelling and Hegel, Stated the lore of Plato, and Socrates greater than Plato, And greater than Socrates sought and stated, Christ divine having studied long, I see reminiscent to-day those Greek and Germanic systems, See the philosophies all, Christian churches and tenets see, Yet underneath Socrates clearly see, and underneath Christ the divine I see, The dear love of man for his comrade, the attraction of friend to friend, Of the well-married husband and wife, of children and parents, Of city for city and land for land.</p><p>Recorders Ages Hence</p><p>Recorders ages hence, Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior, I will tell you what to say of me, Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover, The friend the lover&#39;s portrait, of whom his friend his lover was fondest, Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love within him, and freely pour&#39;d it forth, Who often walk&#39;d lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends, his lovers, Who pensive away from one he lov&#39;d often lay sleepless and dissatisfied at night, Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov&#39;d might secretly be indifferent to him, Whose happiest days were far away through fields, in woods, on hills, he and another wandering hand in hand, they twain apart from other men, Who oft as he saunter&#39;d the streets curv&#39;d with his arm the shoulder of his friend, while the arm of his friend rested upon him also.</p><p>When I Heard at the Close of the Day</p><p>When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv&#39;d with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that follow&#39;d, And else when I carous&#39;d, or when my plans were accomplish&#39;d, still I was not happy, But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refresh&#39;d, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn, When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light, When I wander&#39;d alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise, And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming, O then I was happy, O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food nourish&#39;d me more, and the beautiful day pass&#39;d well, And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came my friend, And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores, I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me, For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night, In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me, And his arm lay lightly around my breast--and that night I was happy.</p><p>Are You the New Person Drawn Toward Me?</p><p>Are you the new person drawn toward me? To begin with take warning, I am surely far different from what you suppose; Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal? Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover? Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy&#39;d satisfaction? Do you think I am trusty and faithful? Do you see no further than this facade, this smooth and tolerant manner of me? Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man? Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya, illusion?</p><p>Roots and Leaves Themselves Alone</p><p>Roots and leaves themselves alone are these, Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pond-side, Breast-sorrel and pinks of love, fingers that wind around tighter than vines, Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the sun is risen, Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living sea, to you O sailors! Frost-mellow&#39;d berries and Third-month twigs offer&#39;d fresh to young persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up, Love-buds put before you and within you whoever you are, Buds to be unfolded on the old terms, If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bring form, color, perfume, to you, If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers, fruits, tall branches and trees.</p><p>Not Heat Flames Up and Consumes</p><p>Not heat flames up and consumes, Not sea-waves hurry in and out, Not the air delicious and dry, the air of ripe summer, bears lightly along white down-balls of myriads of seeds, Waited, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may; Not these, O none of these more than the flames of me, consuming, burning for his love whom I love, O none more than I hurrying in and out; Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up? O I the same, O nor down-balls nor perfumes, nor the high rain-emitting clouds, are borne through the open air, Any more than my soul is borne through the open air, Wafted in all directions O love, for friendship, for you.</p><p>Trickle Drops</p><p>Trickle drops! my blue veins leaving! O drops of me! trickle, slow drops, Candid from me falling, drip, bleeding drops, From wounds made to free you whence you were prison&#39;d, From my face, from my forehead and lips, From my breast, from within where I was conceal&#39;d, press forth red drops, confession drops, Stain every page, stain every song I sing, every word I say, bloody drops, Let them know your scarlet heat, let them glisten, Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet, Glow upon all I have written or shall write, bleeding drops, Let it all be seen in your light, blushing drops.</p><p>City of Orgies</p><p>City of orgies, walks and joys, City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make Not the pageants of you, not your shifting tableaus, your spectacles, repay me, Not the interminable rows of your houses, nor the ships at the wharves, Nor the processions in the streets, nor the bright windows with goods in them, Nor to converse with learn&#39;d persons, or bear my share in the soiree or feast; Not those, but as I pass O Manhattan, your frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me love, Offering response to my own--these repay me, Lovers, continual lovers, only repay me.</p><p>Behold This Swarthy Face</p><p>Behold this swarthy face, these gray eyes, This beard, the white wool unclipt upon my neck, My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm; Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightly on the lips with robust love, And I on the crossing of the street or on the ship&#39;s deck give a kiss in return, We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea, We are those two natural and nonchalant persons.</p><p>I Saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing</p><p>I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing, All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches, Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green, And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself, But I wonder&#39;d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near, for I knew I could not, And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and twined around it a little moss, And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room, It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends, (For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,) Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love; For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide in a wide flat space, Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near, I know very well I could not.</p><p>To a Stranger</p><p>Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you, You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to me as of a dream,) I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you, All is recall&#39;d as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate, chaste, matured, You grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me, I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not yours only nor left my body mine only, You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass, you take of my beard, breast, hands, in return, I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone or wake at night alone, I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again, I am to see to it that I do not lose you.</p><p>This Moment Yearning and Thoughtful</p><p>This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone, It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful, It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or talking other dialects, And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become attached to them as I do to men in my own lands, O I know we should be brethren and lovers, I know I should be happy with them.</p><p>I Hear It Was Charged Against Me</p><p>I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions, But really I am neither for nor against institutions, (What indeed have I in common with them? or what with the destruction of them?) Only I will establish in the Mannahatta and in every city of these States inland and seaboard, And in the fields and woods, and above every keel little or large that dents the water, Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument, The institution of the dear love of comrades.</p><p>The Prairie-Grass Dividing</p><p>The prairie-grass dividing, its special odor breathing, I demand of it the spiritual corresponding, Demand the most copious and close companionship of men, Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings, Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious, Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and command, leading not following, Those with a never-quell&#39;d audacity, those with sweet and lusty flesh clear of taint, Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors, as to say Who are you? Those of earth-born passion, simple, never constrain&#39;d, never obedient, Those of inland America.</p><p>When I Peruse the Conquer&#39;d Fame</p><p>When I peruse the conquer&#39;d fame of heroes and the victories of mighty generals, I do not envy the generals, Nor the President in his Presidency, nor the rich in his great house, But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them, How together through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long and long, Through youth and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how affectionate and faithful they were, Then I am pensive--I hastily walk away fill&#39;d with the bitterest envy.</p><p>We Two Boys Together Clinging</p><p>We two boys together clinging, One the other never leaving, Up and down the roads going, North and South excursions making, Power enjoying, elbows stretching, fingers clutching, Arm&#39;d and fearless, eating, drinking, sleeping, loving. No law less than ourselves owning, sailing, soldiering, thieving, threatening, Misers, menials, priests alarming, air breathing, water drinking, on the turf or the sea-beach dancing, Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness chasing, Fulfilling our foray.</p><p>A Promise to California</p><p>A promise to California, Or inland to the great pastoral Plains, and on to Puget sound and Oregon; Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain, to teach robust American love, For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you, inland, and along the Western sea; For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea, and I will also.</p><p>Here the Frailest Leaves of Me</p><p>Here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting, Here I shade and hide my thoughts, I myself do not expose them, And yet they expose me more than all my other poems.</p><p>No Labor-Saving Machine</p><p>No labor-saving machine, Nor discovery have I made, Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found hospital or library, Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for America, Nor literary success nor intellect; nor book for the book-shelf, But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave, For comrades and lovers.</p><p>A Glimpse</p><p>A glimpse through an interstice caught, Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove late of a winter night, and I unremark&#39;d seated in a corner, Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand, A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and oath and smutty jest, There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, perhaps not a word.</p><p>A Leaf for Hand in Hand</p><p>A leaf for hand in hand; You natural persons old and young! You on the Mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of the Mississippi! You friendly boatmen and mechanics! you roughs! You twain! and all processions moving along the streets!

I Join the group of clam-diggers on the flats, I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettlesome young man; In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on foot on the ice--I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice, Behold me well-clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon, my brood of tough boys accompanying me, My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with no one else so well as they love to be with me, By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.</p><p>Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the buoys,) O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I row just before sunrise toward the buoys, I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert wooden pegs in the &#39;oints of their pincers,</p><p>I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to the shore, There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil&#39;d till their color becomes scarlet.</p><p>Another time mackerel-taking, Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill the water for miles; Another time fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake bay, I one of the brown-faced crew; Another time trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with braced body, My left foot is on the gunwale, my right arm throws far out the coils of slender rope, In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, my companions.</p><p>O boating on the rivers, The voyage down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers, The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweep-oars, The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cook supper at evening.</p><p>(O something pernicious and dread! Something far away from a puny and pious life! Something unproved! something in a trance! Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)</p><p>O to work in mines, or forging iron, Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the ample and shadow&#39;d space, The furnace, the hot liquid pour&#39;d out and running.</p><p>O to resume the joys of the soldier! To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer--to feel his sympathy! To behold his calmness--to be warm&#39;d in the rays of his smile! To go to battle--to hear the bugles play and the drums beat! To hear the crash of artillery--to see the glittering of the bayonets and musket-barrels in the sun!</p><p>To see men fall and die and not complain! To taste the savage taste of blood--to be so devilish! To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.</p><p>O the whaleman&#39;s joys! O I cruise my old cruise again! I feel the ship&#39;s motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes fanning me, I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, There--she blows! Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest--we descend, wild with excitement, I leap in the lower&#39;d boat, we row toward our prey where he lies, We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass, lethargic, basking, I see the harpooneer standing up, I see the weapon dart from his vigorous arm; O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling, running to windward, tows me, Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again, I see a lance driven through his side, press&#39;d deep, turn&#39;d in the wound, Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving him fast, As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower and narrower, swiftly cutting the water--I see him die, He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then falls flat and still in the bloody foam.</p><p>O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all! My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard, My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.</p><p>O ripen&#39;d joy of womanhood! O happiness at last! I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother, How clear is my mind--how all people draw nigh to me! What attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom more than the bloom of youth? What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?</p><p>O the orator&#39;s joys! To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from the ribs and throat, To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself, To lead America--to quell America with a great tongue.</p><p>O the joy of my soul leaning pois&#39;d on itself, receiving identity through materials and loving them, observing characters and absorbing them, My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch, reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like, The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh, My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes, Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes which finally see, Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts, embraces, procreates.</p><p>O the farmer&#39;s joys! Ohioan&#39;s, Illinoisian&#39;s, Wisconsinese&#39;, Kanadian&#39;s, Iowan&#39;s, Kansian&#39;s, Missourian&#39;s, Oregonese&#39; joys! To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work, To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops, To plough land in the spring for maize, To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.</p><p>O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore, To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along the shore.</p><p>O to realize space! The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds, To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying clouds, as one with them.</p><p>O the joy a manly self-hood! To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known or unknown, To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic, To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye, To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest, To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth.</p><p>Knowist thou the excellent joys of youth? Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing face? Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath&#39;d games? Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers? Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?</p><p>Yet O my soul supreme! Knowist thou the joys of pensive thought? Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart? Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow&#39;d yet proud, the suffering and the struggle? The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings day or night? Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space? Prophetic joys of better, loftier love&#39;s ideals, the divine wife, the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade? Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.</p><p>O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave, To meet life as a powerful conqueror, No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms, To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, proving my interior soul impregnable, And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.</p><p>For not life&#39;s joys alone I sing, repeating--the joy of death! The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments, for reasons, Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn&#39;d, or render&#39;d to powder, or buried, My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres, My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications, further offices, eternal uses of the earth.</p><p>O to attract by more than attraction! How it is I know not--yet behold! the something which obeys none of the rest, It is offensive, never defensive--yet how magnetic it draws.</p><p>O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted! To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand! To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face! To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance! To be indeed a God!</p><p>O to sail to sea in a ship! To leave this steady unendurable land, To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the houses, To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship, To sail and sail and sail!</p><p>O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys! To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on! To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports, A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,) A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.</p><p>BOOK XII</p><p>Song of the Broad-Axe</p><pre><code>   1

No, those are not the words, the substantial words are in the ground and sea, They are in the air, they are in you.</p><p>Were you thinking that those were the words, those delicious sounds out of your friends&#39; mouths? No, the real words are more delicious than they.</p><p>Human bodies are words, myriads of words, (In the best poems re-appears the body, man&#39;s or woman&#39;s, well-shaped, natural, gay, Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of shame.)</p><p>Air, soil, water, fire--those are words, I myself am a word with them--my qualities interpenetrate with theirs--my name is nothing to them, Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?</p><p>A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words, sayings, meanings, The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women, are sayings and meanings also.</p><p>The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth, The masters know the earth&#39;s words and use them more than audible words.</p><p>Amelioration is one of the earth&#39;s words, The earth neither lags nor hastens, It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump, It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show.</p><p>The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough, The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so conceal&#39;d either, They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print, They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly, Conveying a sentiment and invitation, I utter and utter, I speak not, yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you? To bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?</p><p>(Accouche! accouchez! Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there? Will you squat and stifle there?)</p><p>The earth does not argue, Is not pathetic, has no arrangements, Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise, Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures, Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out, Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.</p><p>The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself, possesses still underneath, Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of slaves, Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young people, accents of bargainers, Underneath these possessing words that never fall.</p><p>To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail, The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail and reflection does not fall, Also the day and night do not fall, and the voyage we pursue does not fall.</p><p>Of the interminable sisters, Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters, Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters, The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.</p><p>With her ample back towards every beholder, With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age, Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb&#39;d, Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her eyes glance back from it, Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none, Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.</p><p>Seen at hand or seen at a distance, Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day, Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion, Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances of those who are with them, From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance, From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things, From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky, From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them, Every day in public appearing without fall, but never twice with the same companions.</p><p>Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and sixty-five resistlessly round the sun; Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and sixty-five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they.</p><p>Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading, Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing, carrying, The soul&#39;s realization and determination still inheriting, The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing, No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking, Swift, glad, content, unbereav&#39;d, nothing losing, Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account, The divine ship sails the divine sea.</p><pre><code>   2

If they had not reference to you in especial what were they then?)</p><p>I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells the best, I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold.</p><p>Say on, sayers! sing on, singers! Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth! Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost, It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use, When the materials are all prepared and ready, the architects shall appear.</p><p>I swear to you the architects shall appear without fall, I swear to you they will understand you and justify you, The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and encloses all and is faithful to all, He and the rest shall not forget you, they shall perceive that you are not an iota less than they, You shall be fully glorified in them.</p><p>Youth, Day, Old Age and Night</p><p>Youth, large, lusty, loving--youth full of grace, force, fascination, Do you know that Old Age may come after you with equal grace, force, fascination?</p><p>Day full-blown and splendid-day of the immense sun, action, ambition, laughter, The Night follows close with millions of suns, and sleep and restoring darkness.</p><p>BOOK XVII.

Soft! let me just murmur, And do you wait a moment you husky-nois&#39;d sea, For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me, So faint, I must be still, be still to listen, But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me.</p><p>Hither my love!

Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?</p><p>Whereto answering, the sea, Delaying not, hurrying not, Whisper&#39;d me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak, Lisp&#39;d to me the low and delicious word death, And again death, death, death, death Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous&#39;d child&#39;s heart, But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet, Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over, Death, death, death, death, death.</p><p>Which I do not forget. But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother, That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok&#39;s gray beach, With the thousand responsive songs at random, My own songs awaked from that hour, And with them the key, the word up from the waves, The word of the sweetest song and all songs, That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet, (Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside,) The sea whisper&#39;d me.</p><p>As I Ebb&#39;d with the Ocean of Life</p><pre><code>   1

BY THE ROADSIDE</p><p>A Boston Ballad [1854]</p><p>To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early, Here&#39;s a good place at the corner, I must stand and see the show.</p><p>Clear the way there Jonathan! Way for the President&#39;s marshal--way for the government cannon! Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the apparitions copiously tumbling.)</p><p>I love to look on the Stars and Stripes, I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle. How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops! Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.</p><p>A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping, Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless.</p><p>Why this is indeed a show--it has called the dead out of the earth! The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see! Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear! Cock&#39;d hats of mothy mould--crutches made of mist! Arms in slings--old men leaning on young men&#39;s shoulders.</p><p>What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of bare gums? Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for firelocks and level them?</p><p>If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President&#39;s marshal, If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.</p><p>For shame old maniacs--bring down those toss&#39;d arms, and let your white hair be, Here gape your great grandsons, their wives gaze at them from the windows, See how well dress&#39;d, see how orderly they conduct themselves.</p><p>Worse and worse--can&#39;t you stand it? are you retreating? Is this hour with the living too dead for you?</p><p>Retreat then--pell-mell! To your graves--back--back to the hills old limpers! I do not think you belong here anyhow.</p><p>But there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it is, gentlemen of Boston?</p><p>I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England, They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the royal vault, Dig out King George&#39;s coffin, unwrap him quick from the graveclothes, box up his bones for a journey, Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper, Up with your anchor--shake out your sails--steer straight toward Boston bay.</p><p>Now call for the President&#39;s marshal again, bring out the government cannon, Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard it with foot and dragoons.</p><p>This centre-piece for them; Look, all orderly citizens--look from the windows, women!</p><p>The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that will not stay, Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull. You have got your revenge, old buster--the crown is come to its own, and more than its own.</p><p>Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from this day, You are mighty cute--and here is one of your bargains.</p><p>Europe [The 72d and 73d Years of These States]</p><p>Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves, Like lightning it le&#39;pt forth half startled at itself, Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hands tight to the throats of kings.</p><p>O hope and faith! O aching close of exiled patriots&#39; lives! O many a sicken&#39;d heart! Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh.</p><p>And you, paid to defile the People--you liars, mark! Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts, For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his simplicity the poor man&#39;s wages, For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh&#39;d at in the breaking,</p><p>Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge, or the heads of the nobles fall; The People scorn&#39;d the ferocity of kings.</p><p>But the sweetness of mercy brew&#39;d bitter destruction, and the frighten&#39;d monarchs come back, Each comes in state with his train, hangman, priest, tax-gatherer, Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.</p><p>Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape, Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in scarlet folds, Whose face and eyes none may see, Out of its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the arm, One finger crook&#39;d pointed high over the top, like the head of a snake appears.</p><p>Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves, bloody corpses of young men, The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud, And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.</p><p>Those corpses of young men, Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets, those hearts pierc&#39;d by the gray lead, Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter&#39;d vitality.</p><p>They live in other young men O kings! They live in brothers again ready to defy you, They were purified by death, they were taught and exalted.</p><p>Not a grave of the murder&#39;d for freedom but grows seed for freedom, in its turn to bear seed, Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows nourish.</p><p>Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose, But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling, cautioning. Liberty, let others despair of you--I never despair of you.</p><p>Is the house shut? is the master away? Nevertheless, be ready, be not weary of watching, He will soon return, his messengers come anon.</p><p>A Hand-Mirror</p><p>Hold it up sternly--see this it sends back, (who is it? is it you?)

O Manhattan, my own, my peerless! O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!) How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with indifferent hand, How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard in their stead, How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of soldiers,) How Manhattan drum-taps led.</p><p>Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading, Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming and turbulent city, Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth, With her million children around her, suddenly, At dead of night, at news from the south, Incens&#39;d struck with clinch&#39;d hand the pavement.</p><p>A shock electric, the night sustain&#39;d it, Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour&#39;d out its myriads.</p><p>From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways, Leapt they tumultuous, and lo!

How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and their clothes and knapsacks cover&#39;d with dust!) The blood of the city up-arm&#39;d! arm&#39;d! the cry everywhere, The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the public buildings and stores, The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his mother, (Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain him,) The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the way, The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites, The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along, rumble lightly over the stones, (Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence, Soon unlimber&#39;d to begin the red business;) All the mutter of preparation, all the determin&#39;d arming, The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines, The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no mere parade now; War! an arm&#39;d race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning away!

Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their prosperity, (if need be, you shall again have every one of those houses to destroy them, You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, full of comfort, built with money, May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them and all stand fast;) O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor the material good nutriment, Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships, Not the superb ships with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and carrying cargoes, Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues--but you as henceforth I see you, Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars, (ever-enlarging stars,) Divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch&#39;d by the sun, measuring the sky, (Passionately seen and yearn&#39;d for by one poor little child, While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching thrift, thrift;) O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake hissing so curious, Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody death, loved by me, So loved--O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night! Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all--(absolute owner of all)--O banner and pennant!

That immortal house more than all the rows of dwellings ever built!

</code></pre><p>Out from behind this bending rough-cut mask, These lights and shades, this drama of the whole, This common curtain of the face contain&#39;d in me for me, in you for you, in each for each, (Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears--0 heaven! The passionate teeming plays this curtain hid!) This glaze of God&#39;s serenest purest sky, This film of Satan&#39;s seething pit, This heart&#39;s geography&#39;s map, this limitless small continent, this soundless sea; Out from the convolutions of this globe, This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon, than Jupiter, Venus, Mars, This condensation of the universe, (nay here the only universe, Here the idea, all in this mystic handful wrapt;) These burin&#39;d eyes, flashing to you to pass to future time, To launch and spin through space revolving sideling, from these to emanate, To you whoe&#39;er you are--a look.</p><pre><code>   2
</code></pre><p>A traveler of thoughts and years, of peace and war, Of youth long sped and middle age declining, (As the first volume of a tale perused and laid away, and this the second, Songs, ventures, speculations, presently to close,) Lingering a moment here and now, to you I opposite turn, As on the road or at some crevice door by chance, or open&#39;d window, Pausing, inclining, baring my head, you specially I greet, To draw and clinch your soul for once inseparably with mine, Then travel travel on.</p><p>Vocalism</p><pre><code>   1
</code></pre><p>Vocalism, measure, concentration, determination, and the divine power to speak words; Are you full-lung&#39;d and limber-lipp&#39;d from long trial? from vigorous practice? from physique? Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they? Come duly to the divine power to speak words? For only at last after many years, after chastity, friendship, procreation, prudence, and nakedness, After treading ground and breasting river and lake, After a loosen&#39;d throat, after absorbing eras, temperaments, races, after knowledge, freedom, crimes, After complete faith, after clarifyings, elevations, and removing obstructions, After these and more, it is just possible there comes to a man, woman, the divine power to speak words; Then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten all--none refuse, all attend, Armies, ships, antiquities, libraries, paintings, machines, cities, hate, despair, amity, pain, theft, murder, aspiration, form in close ranks, They debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the mouth of that man or that woman.</p><pre><code>   2
</code></pre><p>O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices? Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall follow, As the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps, anywhere around the globe.</p><p>All waits for the right voices; Where is the practis&#39;d and perfect organ? where is the develop&#39;d soul? For I see every word utter&#39;d thence has deeper, sweeter, new sounds, impossible on less terms.</p><p>I see brains and lips closed, tympans and temples unstruck, Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose, Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies slumbering forever ready in all words.</p><p>To Him That Was Crucified</p><p>My spirit to yours dear brother, Do not mind because many sounding your name do not understand you, I do not sound your name, but I understand you, I specify you with joy O my comrade to salute you, and to salute those who are with you, before and since, and those to come also, That we all labor together transmitting the same charge and succession, We few equals indifferent of lands, indifferent of times, We, enclosers of all continents, all castes, allowers of all theologies, Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men, We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the disputers nor any thing that is asserted, We hear the bawling and din, we are reach&#39;d at by divisions, jealousies, recriminations on every side, They close peremptorily upon us to surround us, my comrade, Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and down till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the diverse eras, Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races, ages to come, may prove brethren and lovers as we are.</p><p>You Felons on Trial in Courts</p><p>You felons on trial in courts, You convicts in prison-cells, you sentenced assassins chain&#39;d and handcuff&#39;d with iron, Who am I too that I am not on trial or in prison? Me ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not chain&#39;d with iron, or my ankles with iron?</p><p>You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs or obscene in your rooms, Who am I that I should call you more obscene than myself?</p><p>O culpable! I acknowledge--I expose! (O admirers, praise not me--compliment not me--you make me wince, I see what you do not--I know what you do not.)</p><p>Inside these breast-bones I lie smutch&#39;d and choked, Beneath this face that appears so impassive hell&#39;s tides continually run, Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me, I walk with delinquents with passionate love, I feel I am of them--I belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself, And henceforth I will not deny them--for how can I deny myself?</p><p>Laws for Creations</p><p>Laws for creations, For strong artists and leaders, for fresh broods of teachers and perfect literats for America, For noble savans and coming musicians. All must have reference to the ensemble of the world, and the compact truth of the world, There shall be no subject too pronounced--all works shall illustrate the divine law of indirections.</p><p>What do you suppose creation is? What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk free and own no superior? What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways, but that man or woman is as good as God? And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself? And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean? And that you or any one must approach creations through such laws?</p><p>To a Common Prostitute</p><p>Be composed--be at ease with me--I am Walt Whitman, liberal and lusty as Nature, Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you, Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to rustle for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.</p><p>My girl I appoint with you an appointment, and I charge you that you make preparation to be worthy to meet me, And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.</p><p>Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not forget me.</p><p>I Was Looking a Long While</p><p>I was looking a long while for Intentions, For a clew to the history of the past for myself, and for these chants--and now I have found it, It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither accept nor reject,) It is no more in the legends than in all else, It is in the present--it is this earth to-day, It is in Democracy--(the purport and aim of all the past,) It is the life of one man or one woman to-day--the average man of to-day, It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts, It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery, politics, creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations, All for the modern--all for the average man of to-day.</p><p>Thought</p><p>Of persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth, scholarships, and the like; (To me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away from them, except as it results to their bodies and souls, So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked, And often to me each one mocks the others, and mocks himself or herself, And of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the rotten excrement of maggots, And often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true realities of life, and go toward false realities, And often to me they are alive after what custom has served them, but nothing more, And often to me they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnambules walking the dusk.)</p><p>Miracles</p><p>Why, who makes much of a miracle? As to me I know of nothing else but miracles, Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan, Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky, Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water, Or stand under trees in the woods, Or talk by day with any one I love, or sleep in the bed at night with any one I love, Or sit at table at dinner with the rest, Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car, Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon, Or animals feeding in the fields, Or birds, or the wonderfulness of insects in the air, Or the wonderfulness of the sundown, or of stars shining so quiet and bright, Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring; These with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles, The whole referring, yet each distinct and in its place.</p><p>To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle, Every cubic inch of space is a miracle, Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same, Every foot of the interior swarms with the same. To me the sea is a continual miracle, The fishes that swim--the rocks--the motion of the waves--the ships with men in them, What stranger miracles are there?</p><p>Sparkles from the Wheel</p><p>Where the city&#39;s ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day, Withdrawn I join a group of children watching, I pause aside with them.</p><p>By the curb toward the edge of the flagging, A knife-grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife, Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone, by foot and knee, With measur&#39;d tread he turns rapidly, as he presses with light but firm hand, Forth issue then in copious golden jets, Sparkles from the wheel.</p><p>The scene and all its belongings, how they seize and affect me, The sad sharp-chinn&#39;d old man with worn clothes and broad shoulder-band of leather, Myself effusing and fluid, a phantom curiously floating, now here absorb&#39;d and arrested, The group, (an unminded point set in a vast surrounding,) The attentive, quiet children, the loud, proud, restive base of the streets, The low hoarse purr of the whirling stone, the light-press&#39;d blade, Diffusing, dropping, sideways-darting, in tiny showers of gold, Sparkles from the wheel.</p><p>To a Pupil</p><p>Is reform needed? is it through you? The greater the reform needed, the greater the Personality you need to accomplish it.</p><p>You! do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood, complexion, clean and sweet? Do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul that when you enter the crowd an atmosphere of desire and command enters with you, and every one is impress&#39;d with your Personality?</p><p>O the magnet! the flesh over and over! Go, dear friend, if need be give up all else, and commence to-day to inure yourself to pluck, reality, self-esteem, definiteness, elevatedness, Rest not till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality.</p><p>Unfolded out of the Folds</p><p>Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded, and is always to come unfolded, Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the superbest man of the earth, Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest man, Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be form&#39;d of perfect body, Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the poems of man, (only thence have my poems come;) Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love, only thence can appear the strong and arrogant man I love, Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well-muscled woman love, only thence come the brawny embraces of the man, Unfolded out of the folds of the woman&#39;s brain come all the folds of the man&#39;s brain, duly obedient, Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded, Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy; A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity, but every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman; First the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in himself.</p><p>What Am I After All</p><p>What am I after all but a child, pleas&#39;d with the sound of my own name? repeating it over and over; I stand apart to hear--it never tires me.</p><p>To you your name also; Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations in the sound of your name?</p><p>Kosmos</p><p>Who includes diversity and is Nature, Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth, and the equilibrium also, Who has not look&#39;d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing, Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover, Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the aesthetic or intellectual, Who having consider&#39;d the body finds all its organs and parts good, Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories, The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States; Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons, Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations, The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</p><p>Others May Praise What They Like</p><p>Others may praise what they like; But I, from the banks of the running Missouri, praise nothing in art or aught else, Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river, also the western prairie-scent, And exudes it all again.</p><p>Who Learns My Lesson Complete?</p><p>Who learns my lesson complete? Boss, journeyman, apprentice, churchman and atheist, The stupid and the wise thinker, parents and offspring, merchant, clerk, porter and customer, Editor, author, artist, and schoolboy--draw nigh and commence; It is no lesson--it lets down the bars to a good lesson, And that to another, and every one to another still.</p><p>The great laws take and effuse without argument, I am of the same style, for I am their friend, I love them quits and quits, I do not halt and make salaams.</p><p>I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons of things, They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.</p><p>I cannot say to any person what I hear--I cannot say it to myself-- it is very wonderful.</p><p>It is no small matter, this round and delicious globe moving so exactly in its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt or the untruth of a single second, I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor ten billions of years, Nor plann&#39;d and built one thing after another as an architect plans and builds a house.</p><p>I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman, Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman, Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else.</p><p>Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is immortal; I know it is wonderful, but my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how I was conceived in my mother&#39;s womb is equally wonderful, And pass&#39;d from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of summers and winters to articulate and walk--all this is equally wonderful.</p><p>And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is every bit as wonderful.</p><p>And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful, And that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true, is just as wonderful.</p><p>And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth, is equally wonderful, And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally wonderful.</p><p>Tests</p><p>All submit to them where they sit, inner, secure, unapproachable to analysis in the soul, Not traditions, not the outer authorities are the judges, They are the judges of outer authorities and of all traditions, They corroborate as they go only whatever corroborates themselves, and touches themselves; For all that, they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far and near without one exception.</p><p>The Torch</p><p>On my Northwest coast in the midst of the night a fishermen&#39;s group stands watching, Out on the lake that expands before them, others are spearing salmon, The canoe, a dim shadowy thing, moves across the black water, Bearing a torch ablaze at the prow.</p><p>O Star of France [1870-71]</p><p>O star of France, The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame, Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long, Beseems to-day a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk, And &#39;mid its teeming madden&#39;d half-drown&#39;d crowds, Nor helm nor helmsman.</p><p>Dim smitten star, Orb not of France alone, pale symbol of my soul, its dearest hopes, The struggle and the daring, rage divine for liberty, Of aspirations toward the far ideal, enthusiast&#39;s dreams of brotherhood, Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.</p><p>Star crucified--by traitors sold, Star panting o&#39;er a land of death, heroic land, Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land.</p><p>Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke thee, Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell&#39;d them all, And left thee sacred.</p><p>In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly, In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price, In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg&#39;d sleep, In that alone among thy sisters thou, giantess, didst rend the ones that shamed thee, In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains, This cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet, The spear thrust in thy side.</p><p>O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long! Bear up O smitten orb! O ship continue on!</p><p>Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself, Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos, Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons, Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty, Onward beneath the sun following its course, So thee O ship of France!</p><p>Finish&#39;d the days, the clouds dispel&#39;d The travail o&#39;er, the long-sought extrication, When lo! reborn, high o&#39;er the European world, (In gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours Columbia,) Again thy star O France, fair lustrous star, In heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever, Shall beam immortal.</p><p>The Ox-Tamer</p><p>In a far-away northern county in the placid pastoral region, Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous tamer of oxen, There they bring him the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds to break them, He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him, He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock chafes up and down the yard, The bullock&#39;s head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes, Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides--how soon this tamer tames him; See you! on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old, and he is the man who has tamed them, They all know him, all are affectionate to him; See you! some are such beautiful animals, so lofty looking; Some are buff-color&#39;d, some mottled, one has a white line running along his back, some are brindled, Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)--see you! the bright hides, See, the two with stars on their foreheads--see, the round bodies and broad backs, How straight and square they stand on their legs--what fine sagacious eyes! How straight they watch their tamer--they wish him near them--how they turn to look after him! What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves away from them; Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics, poems, depart--all else departs,) I confess I envy only his fascination--my silent, illiterate friend, Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms, In the northern county far, in the placid pastoral region.</p><p>An Old Man&#39;s Thought of School [For the Inauguration of a Public School, Camden, New Jersey, 1874]</p><p>An old man&#39;s thought of school, An old man gathering youthful memories and blooms that youth itself cannot.</p><p>Now only do I know you, O fair auroral skies--O morning dew upon the grass!</p><p>And these I see, these sparkling eyes, These stores of mystic meaning, these young lives, Building, equipping like a fleet of ships, immortal ships, Soon to sail out over the measureless seas, On the soul&#39;s voyage.</p><p>Only a lot of boys and girls? Only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes? Only a public school?</p><p>Ah more, infinitely more; (As George Fox rais&#39;d his warning cry, &quot;Is it this pile of brick and mortar, these dead floors, windows, rails, you call the church? Why this is not the church at all--the church is living, ever living souls.&quot;)</p><p>And you America, Cast you the real reckoning for your present? The lights and shadows of your future, good or evil? To girlhood, boyhood look, the teacher and the school.</p><p>Wandering at Morn</p><p>Wandering at morn, Emerging from the night from gloomy thoughts, thee in my thoughts, Yearning for thee harmonious Union! thee, singing bird divine! Thee coil&#39;d in evil times my country, with craft and black dismay, with every meanness, treason thrust upon thee, This common marvel I beheld--the parent thrush I watch&#39;d feeding its young, The singing thrush whose tones of joy and faith ecstatic, Fail not to certify and cheer my soul.</p><p>There ponder&#39;d, felt I, If worms, snakes, loathsome grubs, may to sweet spiritual songs be turn&#39;d, If vermin so transposed, so used and bless&#39;d may be, Then may I trust in you, your fortunes, days, my country; Who knows but these may be the lessons fit for you? From these your future song may rise with joyous trills, Destin&#39;d to fill the world.</p><p>Italian Music in Dakota [&quot;The Seventeenth--the finest Regimental Band I ever heard.&quot;]</p><p>Through the soft evening air enwinding all, Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless wilds, In dulcet streams, in flutes&#39; and cornets&#39; notes, Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial, (Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown before, Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related here, Not to the city&#39;s fresco&#39;d rooms, not to the audience of the opera house, Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at home, Sonnambula&#39;s innocent love, trios with Norma&#39;s anguish, And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto;) Ray&#39;d in the limpid yellow slanting sundown, Music, Italian music in Dakota.</p><p>While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl&#39;d realm, Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses, Acknowledging rapport however far remov&#39;d, (As some old root or soil of earth its last-born flower or fruit,) Listens well pleas&#39;d.</p><p>With All Thy Gifts</p><p>With all thy gifts America, Standing secure, rapidly tending, overlooking the world, Power, wealth, extent, vouchsafed to thee--with these and like of these vouchsafed to thee, What if one gift thou lackest? (the ultimate human problem never solving,) The gift of perfect women fit for thee--what if that gift of gifts thou lackest? The towering feminine of thee? the beauty, health, completion, fit for thee? The mothers fit for thee?</p><p>My Picture-Gallery</p><p>In a little house keep I pictures suspended, it is not a fix&#39;d house, It is round, it is only a few inches from one side to the other; Yet behold, it has room for all the shows of the world, all memories! Here the tableaus of life, and here the groupings of death; Here, do you know this? this is cicerone himself, With finger rais&#39;d he points to the prodigal pictures.</p><p>The Prairie States</p><p>A newer garden of creation, no primal solitude, Dense, joyous, modern, populous millions, cities and farms, With iron interlaced, composite, tied, many in one, By all the world contributed--freedom&#39;s and law&#39;s and thrift&#39;s society, The crown and teeming paradise, so far, of time&#39;s accumulations, To justify the past.</p><p>BOOK XXV</p><p>Proud Music of the Storm</p><pre><code>   1

O I will go back to old Tennessee and never wander more.</p><p>Mannahatta</p><p>I was asking for something specific and perfect for my city, Whereupon lo! upsprang the aboriginal name.</p><p>Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly, musical, self-sufficient, I see that the word of my city is that word from of old, Because I see that word nested in nests of water-bays, superb, Rich, hemm&#39;d thick all around with sailships and steamships, an island sixteen miles long, solid-founded, Numberless crowded streets, high growths of iron, slender, strong, light, splendidly uprising toward clear skies, Tides swift and ample, well-loved by me, toward sundown, The flowing sea-currents, the little islands, larger adjoining islands, the heights, the villas, The countless masts, the white shore-steamers, the lighters, the ferry-boats, the black sea-steamers well-model&#39;d, The down-town streets, the jobbers&#39; houses of business, the houses of business of the ship-merchants and money-brokers, the river-streets, Immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand in a week, The carts hauling goods, the manly race of drivers of horses, the brown-faced sailors, The summer air, the bright sun shining, and the sailing clouds aloft, The winter snows, the sleigh-bells, the broken ice in the river, passing along up or down with the flood-tide or ebb-tide, The mechanics of the city, the masters, well-form&#39;d, beautiful-faced, looking you straight in the eyes, Trottoirs throng&#39;d, vehicles, Broadway, the women, the shops and shows, A million people--manners free and superb--open voices--hospitality-- the most courageous and friendly young men, City of hurried and sparkling waters! city of spires and masts! City nested in bays! my city!</p><p>All Is Truth</p><p>O me, man of slack faith so long, Standing aloof, denying portions so long, Only aware to-day of compact all-diffused truth, Discovering to-day there is no lie or form of lie, and can be none, but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself, Or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does.</p><p>(This is curious and may not be realized immediately, but it must be realized, I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest, And that the universe does.)</p><p>Where has fail&#39;d a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth? Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the spirit of man? or in the meat and blood?</p><p>Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself, I see that there are really no liars or lies after all, And that nothing fails its perfect return, and that what are called lies are perfect returns, And that each thing exactly represents itself and what has preceded it, And that the truth includes all, and is compact just as much as space is compact, And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth--but that all is truth without exception; And henceforth I will go celebrate any thing I see or am, And sing and laugh and deny nothing.</p><p>A Riddle Song</p><p>That which eludes this verse and any verse, Unheard by sharpest ear, unform&#39;d in clearest eye or cunningest mind, Nor lore nor fame, nor happiness nor wealth, And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world incessantly, Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss, Open but still a secret, the real of the real, an illusion, Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the owner, Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme, historians in prose, Which sculptor never chisel&#39;d yet, nor painter painted, Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever utter&#39;d, Invoking here and now I challenge for my song.</p><p>Indifferently, &#39;mid public, private haunts, in solitude, Behind the mountain and the wood, Companion of the city&#39;s busiest streets, through the assemblage, It and its radiations constantly glide.</p><p>In looks of fair unconscious babes, Or strangely in the coffin&#39;d dead, Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night, As some dissolving delicate film of dreams, Hiding yet lingering.</p><p>Two little breaths of words comprising it, Two words, yet all from first to last comprised in it.</p><p>How ardently for it! How many ships have sail&#39;d and sunk for it!</p><p>How many travelers started from their homes and neer return&#39;d! How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it! What countless stores of beauty, love, ventur&#39;d for it! How all superbest deeds since Time began are traceable to it--and shall be to the end! How all heroic martyrdoms to it! How, justified by it, the horrors, evils, battles of the earth! How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it, in every age and land, have drawn men&#39;s eyes, Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast, the sky, the islands, and the cliffs, Or midnight&#39;s silent glowing northern lights unreachable.</p><p>Haply God&#39;s riddle it, so vague and yet so certain, The soul for it, and all the visible universe for it, And heaven at last for it.</p><p>Excelsior</p><p>Who has gone farthest? for I would go farther, And who has been just? for I would be the most just person of the earth, And who most cautious? for I would be more cautious, And who has been happiest? O I think it is I--I think no one was ever happier than I, And who has lavish&#39;d all? for I lavish constantly the best I have, And who proudest? for I think I have reason to be the proudest son alive--for I am the son of the brawny and tall-topt city, And who has been bold and true? for I would be the boldest and truest being of the universe, And who benevolent? for I would show more benevolence than all the rest, And who has receiv&#39;d the love of the most friends? for I know what it is to receive the passionate love of many friends, And who possesses a perfect and enamour&#39;d body? for I do not believe any one possesses a more perfect or enamour&#39;d body than mine, And who thinks the amplest thoughts? for I would surround those thoughts, And who has made hymns fit for the earth? for I am mad with devouring ecstasy to make joyous hymns for the whole earth.</p><p>Ah Poverties, Wincings, and Sulky Retreats</p><p>Ah poverties, wincings, and sulky retreats, Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me, (For what is my life or any man&#39;s life but a conflict with foes, the old, the incessant war?) You degradations, you tussle with passions and appetites, You smarts from dissatisfied friendships, (ah wounds the sharpest of all!) You toil of painful and choked articulations, you meannesses, You shallow tongue-talks at tables, (my tongue the shallowest of any;) You broken resolutions, you racking angers, you smother&#39;d ennuis!

They shall train themselves to go in public to become orators and oratresses, Strong and sweet shall their tongues be, poems and materials of poems shall come from their lives, they shall be makers and finders, Of them and of their works shall emerge divine conveyers, to convey gospels, Characters, events, retrospections, shall be convey&#39;d in gospels, trees, animals, waters, shall be convey&#39;d, Death, the future, the invisible faith, shall all be convey&#39;d.</p><p>Weave in, My Hardy Life</p><p>Weave in, weave in, my hardy life, Weave yet a soldier strong and full for great campaigns to come, Weave in red blood, weave sinews in like ropes, the senses, sight weave in, Weave lasting sure, weave day and night the wet, the warp, incessant weave, tire not, (We know not what the use O life, nor know the aim, the end, nor really aught we know, But know the work, the need goes on and shall go on, the death-envelop&#39;d march of peace as well as war goes on,) For great campaigns of peace the same the wiry threads to weave, We know not why or what, yet weave, forever weave.</p><p>Spain, 1873-74</p><p>Out of the murk of heaviest clouds, Out of the feudal wrecks and heap&#39;d-up skeletons of kings, Out of that old entire European debris, the shatter&#39;d mummeries, Ruin&#39;d cathedrals, crumble of palaces, tombs of priests, Lo, Freedom&#39;s features fresh undimm&#39;d look forth--the same immortal face looks forth; (A glimpse as of thy Mother&#39;s face Columbia, A flash significant as of a sword, Beaming towards thee.)</p><p>Nor think we forget thee maternal; Lag&#39;d&#39;st thou so long? shall the clouds close again upon thee?

Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august dramas, I see not America only, not only Liberty&#39;s nation but other nations preparing, I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the solidarity of races, I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world&#39;s stage, (Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the acts suitable to them closed?) I see Freedom, completely arm&#39;d and victorious and very haughty, with Law on one side and Peace on the other, A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste; What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach? I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions, I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken, I see the landmarks of European kings removed, I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others give way;) Never were such sharp questions ask&#39;d as this day, Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God, Lo, how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest! His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere, he colonizes the Pacific, the archipelagoes, With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the wholesale engines of war, With these and the world-spreading factories he interlinks all geography, all lands; What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you, passing under the seas? Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the globe? Is humanity forming en-masse? for lo, tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim, The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war, No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days and nights; Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to pierce it, is full of phantoms, Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me, This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams O years! Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not whether I sleep or wake;) The perform&#39;d America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me, The unperform&#39;d, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.</p><p>Ashes of Soldiers</p><p>Ashes of soldiers South or North, As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought, The war resumes, again to my sense your shapes, And again the advance of the armies.</p><p>Noiseless as mists and vapors, From their graves in the trenches ascending, From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee, From every point of the compass out of the countless graves, In wafted clouds, in myriads large, or squads of twos or threes or single ones they come, And silently gather round me.</p><p>Now sound no note O trumpeters, Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses, With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their thighs, (ah my brave horsemen! My handsome tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride, With all the perils were yours.)</p><p>Nor you drummers, neither at reveille at dawn, Nor the long roll alarming the camp, nor even the muffled beat for burial, Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums.</p><p>But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade, Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless, The slain elate and alive again, the dust and debris alive, I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers.</p><p>Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet, Draw close, but speak not.</p><p>Phantoms of countless lost, Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions, Follow me ever--desert me not while I live.</p><p>Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living--sweet are the musical voices sounding, But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead with their silent eyes.</p><p>Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone, But love is not over--and what love, O comrades! Perfume from battle-fields rising, up from the foetor arising.</p><p>Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love, Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers, Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride.</p><p>Perfume all--make all wholesome, Make these ashes to nourish and blossom, O love, solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry.</p><p>Give me exhaustless, make me a fountain, That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist perennial dew, For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North.</p><p>Thoughts</p><pre><code>   1

Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the Muse;--I say the Form complete is worthier far. The Female equally with the Male, I sing. Nor cease at the theme of One&#39;s-Self. I speak the word of the modern, the word En-Masse. My Days I sing, and the Lands--with interstice I knew of hapless War.

Thou! thou! the vital, universal, giant force resistless, sleepless, calm, Holding Humanity as in thy open hand, as some ephemeral toy, How ill to e&#39;er forget thee!</p><p>For I too have forgotten, (Wrapt in these little potencies of progress, politics, culture, wealth, inventions, civilization,) Have lost my recognition of your silent ever-swaying power, ye mighty, elemental throes, In which and upon which we float, and every one of us is buoy&#39;d.</p><p>A Persian Lesson</p><p>For his o&#39;erarching and last lesson the greybeard sufi, In the fresh scent of the morning in the open air, On the slope of a teeming Persian rose-garden, Under an ancient chestnut-tree wide spreading its branches, Spoke to the young priests and students.</p><p>&quot;Finally my children, to envelop each word, each part of the rest, Allah is all, all, all--immanent in every life and object, May-be at many and many-a-more removes--yet Allah, Allah, Allah is there.</p><p>&quot;Has the estray wander&#39;d far? Is the reason-why strangely hidden? Would you sound below the restless ocean of the entire world? Would you know the dissatisfaction? the urge and spur of every life; The something never still&#39;d--never entirely gone? the invisible need of every seed?</p><p>&quot;It is the central urge in every atom, (Often unconscious, often evil, downfallen,) To return to its divine source and origin, however distant, Latent the same in subject and in object, without one exception.&quot;</p><p>The Commonplace</p><p>The commonplace I sing; How cheap is health! how cheap nobility! Abstinence, no falsehood, no gluttony, lust; The open air I sing, freedom, toleration, (Take here the mainest lesson--less from books--less from the schools,) The common day and night--the common earth and waters, Your farm--your work, trade, occupation, The democratic wisdom underneath, like solid ground for all.</p><p>&quot;The Rounded Catalogue Divine Complete&quot;</p><p>The devilish and the dark, the dying and diseas&#39;d, The countless (nineteen-twentieths) low and evil, crude and savage, The crazed, prisoners in jail, the horrible, rank, malignant, Venom and filth, serpents, the ravenous sharks, liars, the dissolute; (What is the part the wicked and the loathesome bear within earth&#39;s orbic scheme?) Newts, crawling things in slime and mud, poisons, The barren soil, the evil men, the slag and hideous rot.</p><p>Mirages</p><p>More experiences and sights, stranger, than you&#39;d think for; Times again, now mostly just after sunrise or before sunset, Sometimes in spring, oftener in autumn, perfectly clear weather, in plain sight, Camps far or near, the crowded streets of cities and the shopfronts, (Account for it or not--credit or not--it is all true, And my mate there could tell you the like--we have often confab&#39;d about it,) People and scenes, animals, trees, colors and lines, plain as could be, Farms and dooryards of home, paths border&#39;d with box, lilacs in corners, Weddings in churches, thanksgiving dinners, returns of long-absent sons, Glum funerals, the crape-veil&#39;d mother and the daughters, Trials in courts, jury and judge, the accused in the box, Contestants, battles, crowds, bridges, wharves, Now and then mark&#39;d faces of sorrow or joy, (I could pick them out this moment if I saw them again,) Show&#39;d to me--just to the right in the sky-edge, Or plainly there to the left on the hill-tops.</p><p>L. of G.&#39;s Purport</p><p>Not to exclude or demarcate, or pick out evils from their formidable masses (even to expose them,) But add, fuse, complete, extend--and celebrate the immortal and the good. Haughty this song, its words and scope, To span vast realms of space and time, Evolution--the cumulative--growths and generations.</p><p>Begun in ripen&#39;d youth and steadily pursued, Wandering, peering, dallying with all--war, peace, day and night absorbing, Never even for one brief hour abandoning my task, I end it here in sickness, poverty, and old age.</p><p>I sing of life, yet mind me well of death: To-day shadowy Death dogs my steps, my seated shape, and has for years-- Draws sometimes close to me, as face to face.</p><p>The Unexpress&#39;d</p><p>How dare one say it? After the cycles, poems, singers, plays, Vaunted Ionia&#39;s, India&#39;s--Homer, Shakspere--the long, long times&#39; thick dotted roads, areas, The shining clusters and the Milky Ways of stars--Nature&#39;s pulses reap&#39;d, All retrospective passions, heroes, war, love, adoration, All ages&#39; plummets dropt to their utmost depths, All human lives, throats, wishes, brains--all experiences&#39; utterance; After the countless songs, or long or short, all tongues, all lands, Still something not yet told in poesy&#39;s voice or print--something lacking, (Who knows? the best yet unexpress&#39;d and lacking.)</p><p>Grand Is the Seen</p><p>Grand is the seen, the light, to me--grand are the sky and stars, Grand is the earth, and grand are lasting time and space, And grand their laws, so multiform, puzzling, evolutionary; But grander far the unseen soul of me, comprehending, endowing all those, Lighting the light, the sky and stars, delving the earth, sailing the sea, (What were all those, indeed, without thee, unseen soul? of what amount without thee?) More evolutionary, vast, puzzling, O my soul! More multiform far--more lasting thou than they.</p><p>Unseen Buds</p><p>Unseen buds, infinite, hidden well, Under the snow and ice, under the darkness, in every square or cubic inch, Germinal, exquisite, in delicate lace, microscopic, unborn, Like babes in wombs, latent, folded, compact, sleeping; Billions of billions, and trillions of trillions of them waiting, (On earth and in the sea--the universe--the stars there in the heavens,) Urging slowly, surely forward, forming endless, And waiting ever more, forever more behind.</p><p>Good-Bye My Fancy!</p><p>Good-bye my Fancy! Farewell dear mate, dear love! I&#39;m going away, I know not where, Or to what fortune, or whether I may ever see you again, So Good-bye my Fancy.</p><p>Now for my last--let me look back a moment; The slower fainter ticking of the clock is in me, Exit, nightfall, and soon the heart-thud stopping.</p><p>Long have we lived, joy&#39;d, caress&#39;d together; Delightful!--now separation--Good-bye my Fancy.</p><p>Yet let me not be too hasty, Long indeed have we lived, slept, filter&#39;d, become really blended into one; Then if we die we die together, (yes, we&#39;ll remain one,) If we go anywhere we&#39;ll go together to meet what happens, May-be we&#39;ll be better off and blither, and learn something, May-be it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs, (who knows?) May-be it is you the mortal knob really undoing, turning--so now finally, Good-bye--and hail! my Fancy.</p><p>End of # Leaves of Grass, by Walt Whitman</p><p>*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LEAVES OF GRASS ***</p><p>***** This file should be named 1322.txt or 1322.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/2/1322/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/2/1322/</a></p><p>Produced by G.
