</code></pre><p>Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, Sing Heav&#39;nly Muse, that on the secret top Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, In the Beginning how the Heav&#39;ns and Earth Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill Delight thee more, and SILOA&#39;S Brook that flow&#39;d Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song, That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th&#39; AONIAN Mount, while it pursues Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime. And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer Before all Temples th&#39; upright heart and pure, Instruct me, for Thou know&#39;st; Thou from the first Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss And mad&#39;st it pregnant: What in me is dark Illumine, what is low raise and support; That to the highth of this great Argument I may assert th&#39; Eternal Providence, And justifie the wayes of God to men.</p><pre><code>Say first, for Heav&#39;n hides nothing from thy view
</code></pre><p>Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause Mov&#39;d our Grand Parents in that happy State, Favour&#39;d of Heav&#39;n so highly, to fall off From their Creator, and transgress his Will For one restraint, Lords of the World besides? Who first seduc&#39;d them to that fowl revolt? Th&#39; infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv&#39;d The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride Had cast him out from Heav&#39;n, with all his Host Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring To set himself in Glory above his Peers, He trusted to have equal&#39;d the most High, If he oppos&#39;d; and with ambitious aim Against the Throne and Monarchy of God Rais&#39;d impious War in Heav&#39;n and Battel proud With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power Hurld headlong flaming from th&#39; Ethereal Skie With hideous ruine and combustion down To bottomless perdition, there to dwell In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, Who durst defie th&#39; Omnipotent to Arms. Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night To mortal men, he with his horrid crew Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe Confounded though immortal: But his doom Reserv&#39;d him to more wrath; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes That witness&#39;d huge affliction and dismay Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: At once as far as Angels kenn he views The dismal Situation waste and wilde, A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round As one great Furnace flam&#39;d, yet from those flames No light, but rather darkness visible Serv&#39;d only to discover sights of woe, Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all; but torture without end Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum&#39;d: Such place Eternal Justice had prepar&#39;d For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain&#39;d In utter darkness, and their portion set As far remov&#39;d from God and light of Heav&#39;n As from the Center thrice to th&#39; utmost Pole. O how unlike the place from whence they fell! There the companions of his fall, o&#39;rewhelm&#39;d With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, He soon discerns, and weltring by his side One next himself in power, and next in crime, Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam&#39;d BEELZEBUB. To whom th&#39; Arch-Enemy, And thence in Heav&#39;n call&#39;d Satan, with bold words Breaking the horrid silence thus began.</p><pre><code>If thou beest he; But O how fall&#39;n! how chang&#39;d
</code></pre><p>From him, who in the happy Realms of Light Cloth&#39;d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league, United thoughts and counsels, equal hope, And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize, Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest From what highth fal&#39;n, so much the stronger provd He with his Thunder: and till then who knew The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict do I repent or change, Though chang&#39;d in outward lustre; that fixt mind And high disdain, from sence of injur&#39;d merit, That with the mightiest rais&#39;d me to contend, And to the fierce contention brought along Innumerable force of Spirits arm&#39;d That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, His utmost power with adverse power oppos&#39;d In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav&#39;n, And shook his throne. What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome? That Glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee, and deifie his power Who from the terrour of this Arm so late Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods And this Empyreal substance cannot fail, Since through experience of this great event In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc&#39;t, We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal Warr Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, Who now triumphs, and in th&#39; excess of joy Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav&#39;n.</p><pre><code>So spake th&#39; Apostate Angel, though in pain,
</code></pre><p>Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: And him thus answer&#39;d soon his bold Compeer.</p><pre><code>O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,
</code></pre><p>That led th&#39; imbattelld Seraphim to Warr Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds Fearless, endanger&#39;d Heav&#39;ns perpetual King; And put to proof his high Supremacy, Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, Too well I see and rue the dire event, That with sad overthrow and foul defeat Hath lost us Heav&#39;n, and all this mighty Host In horrible destruction laid thus low, As far as Gods and Heav&#39;nly Essences Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains Invincible, and vigour soon returns, Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state Here swallow&#39;d up in endless misery. But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now Of force believe Almighty, since no less Then such could hav orepow&#39;rd such force as ours) Have left us this our spirit and strength intire Strongly to suffer and support our pains, That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, Or do him mightier service as his thralls By right of Warr, what e&#39;re his business be Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire, Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; What can it then avail though yet we feel Strength undiminisht, or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment? Whereto with speedy words th&#39; Arch-fiend reply&#39;d.</p><pre><code>Fall&#39;n Cherube, to be weak is miserable
</code></pre><p>Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, To do ought good never will be our task, But ever to do ill our sole delight, As being the contrary to his high will Whom we resist. If then his Providence Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, Our labour must be to pervert that end, And out of good still to find means of evil; Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb His inmost counsels from their destind aim. But see the angry Victor hath recall&#39;d His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit Back to the Gates of Heav&#39;n: The Sulphurous Hail Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice Of Heav&#39;n receiv&#39;d us falling, and the Thunder, Wing&#39;d with red Lightning and impetuous rage, Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. Let us not slip th&#39; occasion, whether scorn, Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, The seat of desolation, voyd of light, Save what the glimmering of these livid flames Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves, There rest, if any rest can harbour there, And reassembling our afflicted Powers, Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, How overcome this dire Calamity, What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, If not what resolution from despare.</p><pre><code>Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate
</code></pre><p>With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes That sparkling blaz&#39;d, his other Parts besides Prone on the Flood, extended long and large Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr&#39;d on JOVE, BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th&#39; Ocean stream: Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam The Pilot of some small night-founder&#39;d Skiff, Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay Chain&#39;d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence Had ris&#39;n or heav&#39;d his head, but that the will And high permission of all-ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs, That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation, while he sought Evil to others, and enrag&#39;d might see How all his malice serv&#39;d but to bring forth Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn On Man by him seduc&#39;t, but on himself Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour&#39;d. Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld In billows, leave i&#39;th&#39; midst a horrid Vale. Then with expanded wings he stears his flight Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land He lights, if it were Land that ever burn&#39;d With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; And such appear&#39;d in hue, as when the force Of subterranean wind transports a Hill Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter&#39;d side Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible And fewel&#39;d entrals thence conceiving Fire, Sublim&#39;d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, And leave a singed bottom all involv&#39;d With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate, Both glorying to have scap&#39;t the STYGIAN flood As Gods, and by their own recover&#39;d strength, Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.</p><pre><code>Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,
</code></pre><p>Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat That we must change for Heav&#39;n, this mournful gloom For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid What shall be right: fardest from him is best Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings A mind not to be chang&#39;d by Place or Time. The mind is its own place, and in it self Can make a Heav&#39;n of Hell, a Hell of Heav&#39;n. What matter where, if I be still the same, And what I should be, all but less then hee Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least We shall be free; th&#39; Almighty hath not built Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav&#39;n. But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, Th&#39; associates and copartners of our loss Lye thus astonisht on th&#39; oblivious Pool, And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy Mansion, or once more With rallied Arms to try what may be yet Regaind in Heav&#39;n, or what more lost in Hell?</p><pre><code>So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB
</code></pre><p>Thus answer&#39;d. Leader of those Armies bright, Which but th&#39; Omnipotent none could have foyld, If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge Of battel when it rag&#39;d, in all assaults Their surest signal, they will soon resume New courage and revive, though now they lye Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, As we erewhile, astounded and amaz&#39;d, No wonder, fall&#39;n such a pernicious highth.</p><pre><code>He scarce had ceas&#39;t when the superiour Fiend
</code></pre><p>Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, Behind him cast; the broad circumference Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views At Ev&#39;ning from the top of FESOLE, Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands, Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, He walkt with to support uneasie steps Over the burning Marle, not like those steps On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; Nathless he so endur&#39;d, till on the Beach Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call&#39;d His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans&#39;t Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks In VALLOMBROSA, where th&#39; ETRURIAN shades High overarch&#39;t imbowr; or scatterd sedge Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm&#39;d Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie, VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu&#39;d The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld From the safe shore their floating Carkases And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, Under amazement of their hideous change. He call&#39;d so loud, that all the hollow Deep Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates, Warriers, the Flowr of Heav&#39;n, once yours, now lost, If such astonishment as this can sieze Eternal spirits; or have ye chos&#39;n this place After the toyl of Battel to repose Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav&#39;n? Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood With scatter&#39;d Arms and Ensigns, till anon His swift pursuers from Heav&#39;n Gates discern Th&#39; advantage, and descending tread us down Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe. Awake, arise, or be for ever fall&#39;n.</p><pre><code>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung
</code></pre><p>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. Nor did they not perceave the evil plight In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd Innumerable. As when the potent Rod Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day Wav&#39;d round the Coast, up call&#39;d a pitchy cloud Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind, That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung Like Night, and darken&#39;d all the Land of NILE: So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell &#39;Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; Till, as a signal giv&#39;n, th&#39; uplifted Spear Of their great Sultan waving to direct Thir course, in even ballance down they light On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; A multitude, like which the populous North Pour&#39;d never from her frozen loyns, to pass RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands. Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms Excelling human, Princely Dignities, And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; Though of their Names in heav&#39;nly Records now Be no memorial, blotted out and ras&#39;d By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, By falsities and lyes the greatest part Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake God their Creator, and th&#39; invisible Glory of him, that made them, to transform Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn&#39;d With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, And Devils to adore for Deities: Then were they known to men by various Names, And various Idols through the Heathen World. Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last, Rous&#39;d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix Their Seats long after next the Seat of God, Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador&#39;d Among the Nations round, and durst abide JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron&#39;d Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac&#39;d Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines, Abominations; and with cursed things His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan&#39;d, And with their darkness durst affront his light. First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear&#39;d with blood Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire To his grim Idol. Him the AMMONITE Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain, In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream Of utmost ARNON. Nor content with such Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build His Temple right against the Temple of God On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence And black GEHENNA call&#39;d, the Type of Hell. Next CHEMOS, th&#39; obscene dread of MOABS Sons, From AROER to NEBO, and the wild Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines, And ELEALE to th&#39; ASPHALTICK Pool. PEOR his other Name, when he entic&#39;d ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg&#39;d Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate; Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell. With these came they, who from the bordring flood Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male, These Feminine. For Spirits when they please Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft And uncompounded is their Essence pure, Not ti&#39;d or manacl&#39;d with joynt or limb, Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose Dilated or condens&#39;t, bright or obscure, Can execute their aerie purposes, And works of love or enmity fulfill. For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook Their living strength, and unfrequented left His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low Bow&#39;d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear Of despicable foes. With these in troop Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call&#39;d ASTARTE, Queen of Heav&#39;n, with crescent Horns; To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs, In SION also not unsung, where stood Her Temple on th&#39; offensive Mountain, built By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, Beguil&#39;d by fair Idolatresses, fell To Idols foul. THAMMUZ came next behind, Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur&#39;d The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock Ran purple to the Sea, suppos&#39;d with blood Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale Infected SIONS daughters with like heat, Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led His eye survay&#39;d the dark Idolatries Of alienated JUDAH. Next came one Who mourn&#39;d in earnest, when the Captive Ark Maim&#39;d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, Where he fell flat, and sham&#39;d his Worshipers: DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high Rear&#39;d in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON, And ACCARON and GAZA&#39;s frontier bounds. Him follow&#39;d RIMMON, whose delightful Seat Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams. He also against the house of God was bold: A Leper once he lost and gain&#39;d a King, AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew Gods Altar to disparage and displace For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn His odious offrings, and adore the Gods Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear&#39;d A crew who under Names of old Renown, OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus&#39;d Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek Thir wandring Gods disguis&#39;d in brutish forms Rather then human. Nor did ISRAEL scape Th&#39; infection when their borrow&#39;d Gold compos&#39;d The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King Doubl&#39;d that sin in BETHEL and in DAN, Lik&#39;ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass&#39;d From EGYPT marching, equal&#39;d with one stroke Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood Or Altar smoak&#39;d; yet who more oft then hee In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest Turns Atheist, as did ELY&#39;S Sons, who fill&#39;d With lust and violence the house of God. In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, And injury and outrage: And when Night Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine. Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. These were the prime in order and in might; The rest were long to tell, though far renown&#39;d, Th&#39; IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held Gods, yet confest later then Heav&#39;n and Earth Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav&#39;ns first born With his enormous brood, and birthright seis&#39;d By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE His own and RHEA&#39;S Son like measure found; So JOVE usurping reign&#39;d: these first in CREET And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top Of cold OLYMPUS rul&#39;d the middle Air Thir highest Heav&#39;n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff, Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old Fled over ADRIA to th&#39; HESPERIAN Fields, And ore the CELTIC roam&#39;d the utmost Isles. All these and more came flocking; but with looks Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear&#39;d Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost In loss it self; which on his count&#39;nance cast Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais&#39;d Their fainted courage, and dispel&#39;d their fears. Then strait commands that at the warlike sound Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim&#39;d AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall: Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld Th&#39; Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc&#39;t Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz&#39;d, Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: At which the universal Host upsent A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night. All in a moment through the gloom were seen Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air With Orient Colours waving: with them rose A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms Appear&#39;d, and serried Shields in thick array Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais&#39;d To highth of noblest temper Hero&#39;s old Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage Deliberate valour breath&#39;d, firm and unmov&#39;d With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches, troubl&#39;d thoughts, and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they Breathing united force with fixed thought Mov&#39;d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm&#39;d Thir painful steps o&#39;re the burnt soyle; and now Advanc&#39;t in view they stand, a horrid Front Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise Of Warriers old with order&#39;d Spear and Shield, Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief Had to impose: He through the armed Files Darts his experienc&#39;t eye, and soon traverse The whole Battalion views, thir order due, Thir visages and stature as of Gods, Thir number last he summs. And now his heart Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength Glories: For never since created man, Met such imbodied force, as nam&#39;d with these Could merit more then that small infantry Warr&#39;d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood Of PHLEGRA with th&#39; Heroic Race were joyn&#39;d That fought at THEB&#39;S and ILIUM, on each side Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights; And all who since, Baptiz&#39;d or Infidel Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN, DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND, Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell By FONTARABBIA. Thus far these beyond Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ&#39;d Thir dread Commander: he above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost All her Original brightness, nor appear&#39;d Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th&#39; excess Of Glory obscur&#39;d: As when the Sun new ris&#39;n Looks through the Horizontal misty Air Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds On half the Nations, and with fear of change Perplexes Monarchs. Dark&#39;n&#39;d so, yet shon Above them all th&#39; Arch Angel: but his face Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast Signs of remorse and passion to behold The fellows of his crime, the followers rather (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn&#39;d For ever now to have their lot in pain, Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc&#39;t Of Heav&#39;n, and from Eternal Splendors flung For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire Hath scath&#39;d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, With singed top their stately growth though bare Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar&#39;d To speak; whereat their doubl&#39;d Ranks they bend From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round With all his Peers: attention held them mute. Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn, Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last Words interwove with sighs found out their way.</p><pre><code>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers
</code></pre><p>Matchless, but with th&#39; Almighty, and that strife Was not inglorious, though th&#39; event was dire, As this place testifies, and this dire change Hateful to utter: but what power of mind Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth Of knowledge past or present, could have fear&#39;d, How such united force of Gods, how such As stood like these, could ever know repulse? For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, That all these puissant Legions, whose exile Hath emptied Heav&#39;n, shall faile to re-ascend Self-rais&#39;d, and repossess their native seat. For me, be witness all the Host of Heav&#39;n, If counsels different, or danger shun&#39;d By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns Monarch in Heav&#39;n, till then as one secure Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, Consent or custome, and his Regal State Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal&#39;d, Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. Henceforth his might we know, and know our own So as not either to provoke, or dread New warr, provok&#39;t; our better part remains To work in close design, by fraud or guile What force effected not: that he no less At length from us may find, who overcomes By force, hath overcome but half his foe. Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife There went a fame in Heav&#39;n that he ere long Intended to create, and therein plant A generation, whom his choice regard Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: For this Infernal Pit shall never hold Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th&#39; Abysse Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr Open or understood must be resolv&#39;d.</p><pre><code>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew

MAMMON led them on, MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell From heav&#39;n, for ev&#39;n in heav&#39;n his looks &amp; thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of Heav&#39;ns pavement, trod&#39;n Gold, Then aught divine or holy else enjoy&#39;d In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught, Ransack&#39;d the Center, and with impious hands Rifl&#39;d the bowels of thir mother Earth For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew Op&#39;nd into the Hill a spacious wound And dig&#39;d out ribs of Gold. Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings, Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, And Strength and Art are easily outdone By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour What in an age they with incessant toyle And hands innumerable scarce perform Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar&#39;d, That underneath had veins of liquid fire Sluc&#39;d from the Lake, a second multitude With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, Severing each kinde, and scum&#39;d the Bullion dross: A third as soon had form&#39;d within the ground A various mould, and from the boyling cells By strange conveyance fill&#39;d each hollow nook, As in an Organ from one blast of wind To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid With Golden Architrave; nor did there want Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav&#39;n, The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON, Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence Equal&#39;d in all thir glories, to inshrine BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove In wealth and luxurie. Th&#39; ascending pile Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores Op&#39;ning thir brazen foulds discover wide Within, her ample spaces, o&#39;re the smooth And level pavement: from the arched roof Pendant by suttle Magic many a row Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light As from a sky. The hasty multitude Admiring enter&#39;d, and the work some praise And some the Architect: his hand was known In Heav&#39;n by many a Towred structure high, Where Scepter&#39;d Angels held thir residence, And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. Nor was his name unheard or unador&#39;d In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land Men call&#39;d him MULCIBER; and how he fell From Heav&#39;n, they fabl&#39;d, thrown by angry JOVE Sheer o&#39;re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, A Summers day; and with the setting Sun Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, On LEMNOS th&#39; AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate, Erring; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before; nor aught avail&#39;d him now To have built in Heav&#39;n high Towrs; nor did he scape By all his Engins, but was headlong sent With his industrious crew to build in hell. Mean while the winged Haralds by command Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim A solemn Councel forthwith to be held At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call&#39;d From every and Band squared Regiment By place or choice the worthiest; they anon With hundreds and with thousands trooping came Attended: all access was throng&#39;d, the Gates And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall (Though like a cover&#39;d field, where Champions bold Wont ride in arm&#39;d, and at the Soldans chair Defi&#39;d the best of Panim chivalry To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) Thick swarm&#39;d, both on the ground and in the air, Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, New rub&#39;d with Baume, expatiate and confer Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd Swarm&#39;d and were straitn&#39;d; till the Signal giv&#39;n, Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves, Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms Reduc&#39;d thir shapes immense, and were at large, Though without number still amidst the Hall Of that infernal Court. But far within And in thir own dimensions like themselves The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat&#39;s, Frequent and full.

With this advantage then To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, More then can be in Heav&#39;n, we now return To claim our just inheritance of old, Surer to prosper then prosperity Could have assur&#39;d us; and by what best way, Whether of open Warr or covert guile, We now debate; who can advise, may speak.</p><pre><code>He ceas&#39;d, and next him MOLOC, Scepter&#39;d King

But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse. Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok&#39;n Rear Insulting, and pursu&#39;d us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low? Th&#39; ascent is easie then; Th&#39; event is fear&#39;d; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy&#39;d: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv&#39;n out from bliss, condemn&#39;d In this abhorred deep to utter woe; Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge Inexorably, and the torturing houre Calls us to Penance? More destroy&#39;d then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag&#39;d, Will either quite consume us, and reduce To nothing this essential, happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being: Or if our substance be indeed Divine, And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav&#39;n, And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.</p><pre><code>He ended frowning, and his look denounc&#39;d

On th&#39; other side up rose BELIAL, in act more graceful and humane; A fairer person lost not Heav&#39;n; he seemd For dignity compos&#39;d and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear The better reason, to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas&#39;d the eare, And with perswasive accent thus began.</p><pre><code>I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,
</code></pre><p>As not behind in hate; if what was urg&#39;d Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success: When he who most excels in fact of Arms, In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution, as the scope Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav&#39;n are fill&#39;d With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav&#39;ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th&#39; Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious. Thus repuls&#39;d, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th&#39; Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, Though full of pain, this intellectual being, Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, To perish rather, swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night, Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, Let this be good, whether our angry Foe Can give it, or will ever? how he can Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, Belike through impotence, or unaware, To give his Enemies thir wish, and end Them in his anger, whom his anger saves To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, Reserv&#39;d and destin&#39;d to Eternal woe; Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? What when we fled amain, pursu&#39;d and strook With Heav&#39;ns afflicting Thunder, and besought The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem&#39;d A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay Chain&#39;d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindl&#39;d those grim fires Awak&#39;d should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the Flames? or from above Should intermitted vengeance Arme again His red right hand to plague us? what if all Her stores were op&#39;n&#39;d, and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire, Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads; while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious Warr, Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl&#39;d Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; There to converse with everlasting groans, Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or conceal&#39;d, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav&#39;ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav&#39;n Thus trampl&#39;d, thus expell&#39;d to suffer here Chains &amp; these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv&#39;d, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent&#39;rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov&#39;d Not mind us not offending, satisfi&#39;d With what is punish&#39;t; whence these raging fires Will slack&#39;n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur&#39;d not feel, Or chang&#39;d at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future days may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe.</p><pre><code>Thus BELIAL with words cloath&#39;d in reasons garb

Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos&#39;d, to celebrate his Throne With warbl&#39;d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing Forc&#39;t Halleluiah&#39;s; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings. This must be our task In Heav&#39;n, this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain&#39;d Unacceptable, though in Heav&#39;n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appear Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse We can create, and in what place so e&#39;re Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and endurance. This deep world Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav&#39;ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur&#39;d, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must&#39;ring thir rage, and Heav&#39;n resembles Hell? As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav&#39;n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang&#39;d Into their temper; which must needs remove The sensible of pain. All things invite To peaceful Counsels, and the settl&#39;d State Of order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regard Of what we are and where, dismissing quite All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.</p><pre><code>He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld

Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv&#39;d, then whom, SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem&#39;d A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and publick care; And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.</p><pre><code>Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav&#39;n,
</code></pre><p>Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now Must we renounce, and changing stile be call&#39;d Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote Inclines, here to continue, and build up here A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, And know not that the King of Heav&#39;n hath doom&#39;d This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt From Heav&#39;ns high jurisdiction, in new League Banded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far remov&#39;d, Under th&#39; inevitable curb, reserv&#39;d His captive multitude: For he, be sure, In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt, but over Hell extend His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav&#39;n. What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr? Warr hath determin&#39;d us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none Voutsaf&#39;t or sought; for what peace will be giv&#39;n To us enslav&#39;d, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam&#39;d reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav&#39;n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find Some easier enterprize? There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav&#39;n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of som new Race call&#39;d MAN, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour&#39;d more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc&#39;d among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav&#39;ns whol circumference, confirm&#39;d. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, Or substance, how endu&#39;d, and what thir Power, And where thir weakness, how attempted best, By force or suttlety: Though Heav&#39;n be shut, And Heav&#39;ns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength, this place may lye expos&#39;d The utmost border of his Kingdom, left To their defence who hold it: here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achiev&#39;d By sudden onset, either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation, or possess All as our own, and drive as we were driven, The punie habitants, or if not drive, Seduce them to our Party, that thir God May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works. This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joy In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise In his disturbance; when his darling Sons Hurl&#39;d headlong to partake with us, shall curse Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss, Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth Attempting, or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires. Thus BEELZEBUB Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis&#39;d By SATAN, and in part propos&#39;d: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice, to confound the race Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve, done all to spite The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves His glory to augment. The bold design Pleas&#39;d highly those infernal States, and joy Sparkl&#39;d in all thir eyes; with full assent They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.</p><pre><code>Well have ye judg&#39;d, well ended long debate,

But first whom shall we send In search of this new world, whom shall we find Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottom&#39;d infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round?

These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung&#39;d in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into what ever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov&#39;ranty, adorn&#39;d With splendor, arm&#39;d with power, if aught propos&#39;d And judg&#39;d of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterre Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour, due alike To him who Reigns, and so much to him due Of hazard more, as he above the rest High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers, Terror of Heav&#39;n, though fall&#39;n; intend at home, While here shall be our home, what best may ease The present misery, and render Hell More tollerable; if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive, or slack the pain Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all: this enterprize None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose The Monarch, and prevented all reply, Prudent, least from his resolution rais&#39;d Others among the chief might offer now (Certain to be refus&#39;d) what erst they feard; And so refus&#39;d might in opinion stand His rivals, winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they Dreaded not more th&#39; adventure then his voice Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone; and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav&#39;n: Nor fail&#39;d they to express how much they prais&#39;d, That for the general safety he despis&#39;d His own: for neither do the Spirits damn&#39;d Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, Or close ambition varnisht o&#39;re with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o&#39;respread Heav&#39;ns chearful face, the lowring Element Scowls ore the dark&#39;nd lantskip Snow, or showre; If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his ev&#39;ning beam, the fields revive, The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn&#39;d Firm concord holds, men onely disagree Of Creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: As if (which might induce us to accord) Man had not hellish foes anow besides, That day and night for his destruction waite.</p><pre><code>The STYGIAN Councel thus dissolv&#39;d; and forth

As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag&#39;d in the troubl&#39;d Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav&#39;n the welkin burns. Others with vast TYPHOEAN rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when ALCIDES from OEALIA Crown&#39;d With conquest, felt th&#39; envenom&#39;d robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots THESSALIAN Pines, And LICHAS from the top of OETA threw Into th&#39; EUBOIC Sea. Others more milde, Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir song was partial, but the harmony (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) Others apart sat on a Hill retir&#39;d, In thoughts more elevate, and reason&#39;d high Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argu&#39;d then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish, and excite Fallacious hope, or arm th&#39; obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps Might yeild them easier habitation, bend Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; Abhorred STYX the flood of deadly hate, Sad ACHERON of sorrow, black and deep; COCYTUS, nam&#39;d of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream; fierce PHLEGETON Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, LETHE the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, A gulf profound as that SERBONIAN Bog Betwixt DAMIATA and mount CASIUS old, Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air Burns frore, and cold performs th&#39; effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail&#39;d, At certain revolutions all the damn&#39;d Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this LETHEAN Sound Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, All in one moment, and so neer the brink; But fate withstands, and to oppose th&#39; attempt MEDUSA with GORGONIAN terror guards The Ford, and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight, as once it fled The lip of TANTALUS. Thus roving on In confus&#39;d march forlorn, th&#39; adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast View&#39;d first thir lamentable lot, and found No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile They pass&#39;d, and many a Region dolorous, O&#39;re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe, Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, A Universe of death, which God by curse Created evil, for evil only good, Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable, and worse Then Fables yet have feign&#39;d, or fear conceiv&#39;d, GORGONS and HYDRA&#39;S, and CHIMERA&#39;S dire.</p><pre><code>Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,

As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri&#39;d Hangs in the Clouds, by AEQUINOCTIAL Winds Close sailing from BENGALA, or the Iles Of TERNATE and TIDORE, whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood Through the wide ETHIOPIAN to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem&#39;d Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, Impenitrable, impal&#39;d with circling fire, Yet unconsum&#39;d. Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem&#39;d Woman to the waste, and fair, But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm&#39;d With mortal sting: about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark&#39;d With wide CERBEREAN mouths full loud, and rung A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, If aught disturb&#39;d thir noyse, into her woomb, And kennel there, yet there still bark&#39;d and howl&#39;d Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd then these Vex&#39;d SCYLLA bathing in the Sea that parts CALABRIA from the hoarce TRINACRIAN shore: Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call&#39;d In secret, riding through the Air she comes Lur&#39;d with the smell of infant blood, to dance With LAPLAND Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape, If shape it might be call&#39;d that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call&#39;d that shadow seem&#39;d, For each seem&#39;d either; black it stood as Night, Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem&#39;d his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. SATAN was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast, With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th&#39; undaunted Fiend what this might be admir&#39;d, Admir&#39;d, not fear&#39;d; God and his Son except, Created thing naught vallu&#39;d he nor shun&#39;d; And with disdainful look thus first began.</p><pre><code>Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,

Some I have chosen of peculiar grace Elect above the rest; so is my will: The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes Th&#39; incensed Deitie, while offerd grace Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, What may suffice, and soft&#39;n stonie hearts To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.

This my long sufferance and my day of grace They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; But hard be hard&#39;nd, blind be blinded more, That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; And none but such from mercy I exclude. But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns Against the high Supremacie of Heav&#39;n, Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, To expiate his Treason hath naught left, But to destruction sacred and devote, He with his whole posteritie must die, Die hee or Justice must; unless for him Som other able, and as willing, pay The rigid satisfaction, death for death.

Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe Of this round World, whose first convex divides The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos&#39;d From CHAOS and th&#39; inroad of Darkness old, SATAN alighted walks: a Globe farr off It seem&#39;d, now seems a boundless Continent Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night Starless expos&#39;d, and ever-threatning storms Of CHAOS blustring round, inclement skie; Save on that side which from the wall of Heav&#39;n Though distant farr som small reflection gaines Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: Here walk&#39;d the Fiend at large in spacious field. As when a Vultur on IMAUS bred, Whose snowie ridge the roving TARTAR bounds, Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs Of GANGES or HYDASPES, INDIAN streams; But in his way lights on the barren plaines Of SERICANA, where CHINESES drive With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend Walk&#39;d up and down alone bent on his prey, Alone, for other Creature in this place Living or liveless to be found was none, None yet, but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like Aereal vapours flew Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin With vanity had filld the works of men: Both all things vain, and all who in vain things Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, Or happiness in this or th&#39; other life; All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; All th&#39; unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, Till final dissolution, wander here, Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; Those argent Fields more likely habitants, Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold Betwixt th&#39; Angelical and Human kinde: Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born First from the ancient World those Giants came With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: The builders next of BABEL on the Plain Of SENNAAR, and still with vain designe New BABELS, had they wherewithall, would build: Others came single; hee who to be deemd A God, leap&#39;d fondly into AETNA flames, EMPEDOCLES, and hee who to enjoy PLATO&#39;S ELYSIUM, leap&#39;d into the Sea, CLEOMBROTUS, and many more too long, Embryo&#39;s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. Here Pilgrims roam, that stray&#39;d so farr to seek In GOLGOTHA him dead, who lives in Heav&#39;n; And they who to be sure of Paradise Dying put on the weeds of DOMINIC, Or in FRANCISCAN think to pass disguis&#39;d; They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov&#39;d; And now Saint PETER at Heav&#39;ns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot Of Heav&#39;ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe A violent cross wind from either Coast Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry Into the devious Air; then might ye see Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft Fly o&#39;re the backside of the World farr off Into a LIMBO large and broad, since calld The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown Long after, now unpeopl&#39;d, and untrod; All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass&#39;d, And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste His travell&#39;d steps; farr distant hee descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. The Stairs were such as whereon JACOB saw Angels ascending and descending, bands Of Guardians bright, when he from ESAU fled To PADAN-ARAM in the field of LUZ, Dreaming by night under the open Skie, And waking cri&#39;d, This is the Gate of Heav&#39;n. Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav&#39;n somtimes Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow&#39;d Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv&#39;d, Wafted by Angels, or flew o&#39;re the Lake Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. Direct against which op&#39;nd from beneath, Just o&#39;re the blissful seat of Paradise, A passage down to th&#39; Earth, a passage wide, Wider by farr then that of after-times Over Mount SION, and, though that were large, Over the PROMIS&#39;D LAND to God so dear, By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, On high behests his Angels to and fro Pass&#39;d frequent, and his eye with choice regard From PANEAS the fount of JORDANS flood To BEERSABA, where the HOLY LAND Borders on AEGYPT and the ARABIAN shoare; So wide the op&#39;ning seemd, where bounds were set To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. SATAN from hence now on the lower stair That scal&#39;d by steps of Gold to Heav&#39;n Gate Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this World at once. As when a Scout Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone All night; at last by break of chearful dawne Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some forein land First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. Such wonder seis&#39;d, though after Heaven seen, The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis&#39;d At sight of all this World beheld so faire. Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood So high above the circling Canopie Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point Of LIBRA to the fleecie Starr that bears ANDROMEDA farr off ATLANTICK Seas Beyond th&#39; HORIZON; then from Pole to Pole He views in bredth, and without longer pause Down right into the Worlds first Region throws His flight precipitant, and windes with ease Through the pure marble Air his oblique way Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, Like those HESPERIAN Gardens fam&#39;d of old, Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there He stayd not to enquire: above them all The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven Allur&#39;d his eye: Thither his course he bends Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms The Univers, and to each inward part With gentle penetration, though unseen, Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: So wondrously was set his Station bright. There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Sun&#39;s lucent Orbe Through his glaz&#39;d Optic Tube yet never saw. The place he found beyond expression bright, Compar&#39;d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; Not all parts like, but all alike informd With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon In AARONS Brest-plate, and a stone besides Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, That stone, or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought, In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde Volatil HERMES, and call up unbound In various shapes old PROTEUS from the Sea, Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth ELIXIR pure, and Rivers run Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch Th&#39; Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious and effect so rare? Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazl&#39;d, farr and wide his eye commands, For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon Culminate from th&#39; AEQUATOR, as they now Shot upward still direct, whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, No where so cleer, sharp&#39;nd his visual ray To objects distant farr, whereby he soon Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, The same whom JOHN saw also in the Sun: His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar Circl&#39;d his Head, nor less his Locks behind Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy&#39;d Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope To find who might direct his wandring flight To Paradise the happie seat of Man, His journies end and our beginning woe. But first he casts to change his proper shape, Which else might work him danger or delay: And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, Not of the prime, yet such as in his face Youth smil&#39;d Celestial, and to every Limb Sutable grace diffus&#39;d, so well he feignd; Under a Coronet his flowing haire In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore Of many a colourd plume sprinkl&#39;d with Gold, His habit fit for speed succinct, and held Before his decent steps a Silver wand. He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known Th&#39; Arch-Angel URIEL, one of the seav&#39;n Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes That run through all the Heav&#39;ns, or down to th&#39; Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, O&#39;re Sea and Land: him SATAN thus accostes;</p><pre><code>URIEL, for thou of those seav&#39;n Spirits that stand

Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know The works of God, thereby to glorifie The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess That reaches blame, but rather merits praise The more it seems excess, that led thee hither From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps Contented with report heare onely in heav&#39;n: For wonderful indeed are all his works, Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; But what created mind can comprehend Thir number, or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, This worlds material mould, came to a heap: Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar Stood rul&#39;d, stood vast infinitude confin&#39;d; Till at his second bidding darkness fled, Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav&#39;n Flew upward, spirited with various forms, That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; Each had his place appointed, each his course, The rest in circuit walles this Universe. Look downward on that Globe whose hither side With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light His day, which else as th&#39; other Hemisphere Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide Timely interposes, and her monthly round Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav&#39;n; With borrowd light her countenance triform Hence fills and empties to enlighten th&#39; Earth, And in her pale dominion checks the night.

O then at last relent: is there no place Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? None left but by submission; and that word DISDAIN forbids me, and my dread of shame Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc&#39;d With other promises and other vaunts Then to submit, boasting I could subdue Th&#39; Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, Under what torments inwardly I groane; While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, With Diadem and Scepter high advanc&#39;d The lower still I fall, onely Supream In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. But say I could repent and could obtaine By Act of Grace my former state; how soon Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay What feign&#39;d submission swore: ease would recant Vows made in pain, as violent and void. For never can true reconcilement grow Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc&#39;d so deep: Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare Short intermission bought with double smart. This knows my punisher; therefore as farr From granting hee, as I from begging peace: All hope excluded thus, behold in stead Of us out-cast, exil&#39;d, his new delight, Mankind created, and for him this World. So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least Divided Empire with Heav&#39;ns King I hold By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.</p><pre><code>Thus while he spake, each passion dimm&#39;d his face

Whereof hee soon aware, Each perturbation smooth&#39;d with outward calme, Artificer of fraud; and was the first That practisd falshood under saintly shew, Deep malice to conceale, couch&#39;t with revenge: Yet not anough had practisd to deceive URIEL once warnd; whose eye pursu&#39;d him down The way he went, and on th&#39; ASSYRIAN mount Saw him disfigur&#39;d, more then could befall Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, As he suppos&#39;d, all unobserv&#39;d, unseen. So on he fares, and to the border comes Of EDEN, where delicious Paradise, Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, As with a rural mound the champain head Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, Access deni&#39;d; and over head up grew Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung: Which to our general Sire gave prospect large Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. And higher then that Wall a circling row Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: On which the Sun more glad impress&#39;d his beams Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy, able to drive All sadness but despair: now gentle gales Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile Beyond the CAPE OF HOPE, and now are past MOZAMBIC, off at Sea North-East windes blow SABEAN Odours from the spicie shoare Of ARABIE the blest, with such delay Well pleas&#39;d they slack thir course, and many a League Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas&#39;d Then ASMODEUS with the fishie fume, That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse Of TOBITS Son, and with a vengeance sent From MEDIA post to AEGYPT, there fast bound.</p><pre><code>Now to th&#39; ascent of that steep savage Hill

As when a prowling Wolfe, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve In hurdl&#39;d Cotes amid the field secure, Leaps o&#39;re the fence with ease into the Fould: Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, In at the window climbes, or o&#39;re the tiles; So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, The middle Tree and highest there that grew, Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death To them who liv&#39;d; nor on the vertue thought Of that life-giving Plant, but only us&#39;d For prospect, what well us&#39;d had bin the pledge Of immortalitie. So little knows Any, but God alone, to value right The good before him, but perverts best things To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. Beneath him with new wonder now he views To all delight of human sense expos&#39;d In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise Of God the Garden was, by him in the East Of EDEN planted; EDEN stretchd her Line From AURAN Eastward to the Royal Towrs Of great SELEUCIA, built by GRECIAN Kings, Or where the Sons of EDEN long before Dwelt in TELASSAR: in this pleasant soile His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; Out of the fertil ground he caus&#39;d to grow All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by, Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. Southward through EDEN went a River large, Nor chang&#39;d his course, but through the shaggie hill Pass&#39;d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais&#39;d Upon the rapid current, which through veins Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill Waterd the Garden; thence united fell Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, Which from his darksom passage now appeers, And now divided into four main Streams, Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme And Country whereof here needs no account, But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, With mazie error under pendant shades Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote The open field, and where the unpierc&#39;t shade Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, A happy rural seat of various view; Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde Hung amiable, HESPERIAN Fables true, If true, here onely, and of delicious taste: Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks Grasing the tender herb, were interpos&#39;d, Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap Of som irriguous Valley spread her store, Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves Of coole recess, o&#39;re which the mantling Vine Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams. The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune The trembling leaves, while Universal PAN Knit with the GRACES and the HOURS in dance Led on th&#39; Eternal Spring. Not that faire field Of ENNA, where PROSERPIN gathring flours Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie DIS Was gatherd, which cost CERES all that pain To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove Of DAPHNE by ORONTES, and th&#39; inspir&#39;d CASTALIAN Spring might with this Paradise Of EDEN strive; nor that NYSEIAN Ile Girt with the River TRITON, where old CHAM, Whom Gentiles AMMON call and LIBYAN JOVE, Hid AMALTHEA and her Florid Son Young BACCHUS from his Stepdame RHEA&#39;S eye; Nor where ABASSIN Kings thir issue Guard, Mount AMARA, though this by som suppos&#39;d True Paradise under the ETHIOP Line By NILUS head, enclos&#39;d with shining Rock, A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote From this ASSYRIAN Garden, where the Fiend Saw undelighted all delight, all kind Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, Godlike erect, with native Honour clad In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine The image of thir glorious Maker shon, Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, Severe, but in true filial freedom plac&#39;t; Whence true autoritie in men; though both Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; For contemplation hee and valour formd, For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, Hee for God only, shee for God in him: His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar&#39;d Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: Shee as a vail down to the slender waste Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav&#39;d As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli&#39;d Subjection, but requir&#39;d with gentle sway, And by her yeilded, by him best receivd, Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride, And sweet reluctant amorous delay. Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame Of natures works, honor dishonorable, Sin-bred, how have ye troubl&#39;d all mankind With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, And banisht from mans life his happiest life, Simplicitie and spotless innocence. So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair That ever since in loves imbraces met, ADAM the goodliest man of men since borne His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters EVE. Under a tuft of shade that on a green Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side They sat them down, and after no more toil Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic&#39;d To recommend coole ZEPHYR, and made ease More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, Alone as they. About them frisking playd All Beasts of th&#39; Earth, since wilde, and of all chase In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw Dandl&#39;d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards Gambold before them, th&#39; unwieldy Elephant To make them mirth us&#39;d all his might, &amp; wreathd His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine His breaded train, and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun Declin&#39;d was hasting now with prone carreer To th&#39; Ocean Iles, and in th&#39; ascending Scale Of Heav&#39;n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: When SATAN still in gaze, as first he stood, Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.</p><pre><code>O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,

Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, Or undiminisht brightness, to be known As when thou stoodst in Heav&#39;n upright and pure; That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, Departed from thee, and thou resembl&#39;st now Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.

So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, Which thou incurr&#39;st by flying, meet thy flight Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain Can equal anger infinite provok&#39;t. But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, The first in flight from pain, had&#39;st thou alleg&#39;d To thy deserted host this cause of flight, Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.</p><pre><code>To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.

Awake My fairest, my espous&#39;d, my latest found, Heav&#39;ns last best gift, my ever new delight, Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, What drops the Myrrhe, &amp; what the balmie Reed, How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.</p><pre><code>Such whispering wak&#39;d her, but with startl&#39;d eye
</code></pre><p>On ADAM, whom imbracing, thus she spake.</p><pre><code>O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,
</code></pre><p>My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see Thy face, and Morn return&#39;d, for I this Night, Such night till this I never pass&#39;d, have dream&#39;d, If dream&#39;d, not as I oft am wont, of thee, Works of day pass&#39;t, or morrows next designe, But of offence and trouble, which my mind Knew never till this irksom night; methought Close at mine ear one call&#39;d me forth to walk With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said, Why sleepst thou EVE? now is the pleasant time, The cool, the silent, save where silence yields To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake Tunes sweetest his love-labor&#39;d song; now reignes Full Orb&#39;d the Moon, and with more pleasing light Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain, If none regard; Heav&#39;n wakes with all his eyes, Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire, In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; To find thee I directed then my walk; And on, methought, alone I pass&#39;d through ways That brought me on a sudden to the Tree Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem&#39;d, Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood One shap&#39;d &amp; wing&#39;d like one of those from Heav&#39;n By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill&#39;d Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz&#39;d; And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg&#39;d, Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis&#39;d? Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? This said he paus&#39;d not, but with ventrous Arme He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil&#39;d At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: But he thus overjoy&#39;d, O Fruit Divine, Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, Forbidd&#39;n here, it seems, as onely fit For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more Communicated, more abundant growes, The Author not impair&#39;d, but honourd more? Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic EVE, Partake thou also; happie though thou art, Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind, But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes Ascend to Heav&#39;n, by merit thine, and see What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell So quick&#39;nd appetite, that I, methought, Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds With him I flew, and underneath beheld The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide And various: wondring at my flight and change To this high exaltation; suddenly My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down, And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak&#39;d To find this but a dream! Thus EVE her Night Related, and thus ADAM answerd sad.</p><pre><code>Best Image of my self and dearer half,
</code></pre><p>The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep Affects me equally; nor can I like This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, Created pure. But know that in the Soule Are many lesser Faculties that serve Reason as chief; among these Fansie next Her office holds; of all external things, Which the five watchful Senses represent, She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames All what we affirm or what deny, and call Our knowledge or opinion; then retires Into her private Cell when Nature rests. Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes, Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams, Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. Som such resemblances methinks I find Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream, But with addition strange; yet be not sad. Evil into the mind of God or Man May come and go, so unapprov&#39;d, and leave No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream, Waking thou never wilt consent to do. Be not disheart&#39;nd then, nor cloud those looks That wont to be more chearful and serene Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, And let us to our fresh imployments rise Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours That open now thir choicest bosom&#39;d smells Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.</p><pre><code>So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,

Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens To us invisible or dimly seen In these thy lowest works, yet these declare Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs And choral symphonies, Day without Night, Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav&#39;n, On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, If better thou belong not to the dawn, Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise In thy eternal course, both when thou climb&#39;st, And when high Noon hast gaind, &amp; when thou fallst. Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli&#39;st With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, And yee five other wandring Fires that move In mystic Dance not without Song, resound His praise, who out of Darkness call&#39;d up Light. Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix And nourish all things, let your ceasless change Varie to our great Maker still new praise. Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey, Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold, In honour to the Worlds great Author rise, Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie, Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, Rising or falling still advance his praise. His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend, Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise; Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven, To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.

At once on th&#39; Eastern cliff of Paradise He lights, and to his proper shape returns A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad Each shoulder broad, came mantling o&#39;re his brest With regal Ornament; the middle pair Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold And colours dipt in Heav&#39;n; the third his feet Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile Skie-tinctur&#39;d grain.

The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle Of congregated Waters he call&#39;d Seas: And saw that it was good, and said, Let th&#39; Earth Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn&#39;d, Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad Her Universal Face with pleasant green, Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour&#39;d Op&#39;ning thir various colours, and made gay Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, Forth flourish&#39;t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed Embattell&#39;d in her field: add the humble Shrub, And Bush with frizl&#39;d hair implicit: last Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm&#39;d Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, With tufts the vallies &amp; each fountain side, With borders long the Rivers.

Wherever thus created, for no place Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know&#39;st He brought thee into this delicious Grove, This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, Delectable both to behold and taste; And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th&#39; Earth yeelds, Varietie without end; but of the Tree Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, Thou mai&#39;st not; in the day thou eat&#39;st, thou di&#39;st; Death is the penaltie impos&#39;d, beware, And govern well thy appetite, least sin Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. Here finish&#39;d hee, and all that he had made View&#39;d, and behold all was entirely good; So Ev&#39;n and Morn accomplish&#39;d the Sixt day: Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd Up to the Heav&#39;n of Heav&#39;ns his high abode, Thence to behold this new created World Th&#39; addition of his Empire, how it shew&#39;d In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, Answering his great Idea. Up he rode Followd with acclamation and the sound Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun&#39;d Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire Resounded, (thou remember&#39;st, for thou heardst) The Heav&#39;ns and all the Constellations rung, The Planets in thir stations list&#39;ning stood, While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, Open, ye Heav&#39;ns, your living dores; let in The great Creator from his work returnd Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne To visit oft the dwellings of just Men Delighted, and with frequent intercourse Thither will send his winged Messengers On errands of supernal Grace. So sung The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav&#39;n, That open&#39;d wide her blazing Portals, led To Gods Eternal house direct the way, A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seaventh Eev&#39;ning arose in EDEN, for the Sun Was set, and twilight from the East came on, Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount Of Heav&#39;ns high-seated top, th&#39; Impereal Throne Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, The Filial Power arriv&#39;d, and sate him down With his great Father (for he also went Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain&#39;d, Author and end of all things, and from work Now resting, bless&#39;d and hallowd the Seav&#39;nth day, As resting on that day from all his work, But not in silence holy kept; the Harp Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire Temper&#39;d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, Great are thy works, JEHOVAH, infinite Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue Relate thee; greater now in thy return Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day Thy Thunders magnifi&#39;d; but to create Is greater then created to destroy. Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes To lessen thee, against his purpose serves To manifest the more thy might: his evil Thou usest, and from thence creat&#39;st more good. Witness this new-made World, another Heav&#39;n From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view On the cleer HYALINE, the Glassie Sea; Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr&#39;s Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World Of destind habitation; but thou know&#39;st Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus&#39;d, Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men, And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc&#39;t, Created in his Image, there to dwell And worship him, and in reward to rule Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, And multiply a Race of Worshippers Holy and just: thrice happie if they know Thir happiness, and persevere upright.</p><pre><code>So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,

The swiftness of those Circles attribute, Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, That to corporeal substances could adde Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav&#39;n Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv&#39;d In EDEN, distance inexpressible By Numbers that have name.

Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, In six thou seest, and what if sev&#39;nth to these The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, Insensibly three different Motions move? Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, Mov&#39;d contrarie with thwart obliquities, Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos&#39;d, Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day Travelling East, and with her part averse From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part Still luminous by his ray. What if that light Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce Fruits in her soft&#39;nd Soile, for some to eate Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie Communicating Male and Femal Light, Which two great Sexes animate the World, Stor&#39;d in each Orb perhaps with some that live. For such vast room in Nature unpossest By living Soule, desert and desolate, Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr Down to this habitable, which returnes Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.

As new wak&#39;t from soundest sleep Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun Soon dri&#39;d, and on the reaking moisture fed. Strait toward Heav&#39;n my wondring Eyes I turnd, And gaz&#39;d a while the ample Skie, till rais&#39;d By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, As thitherward endevoring, and upright Stood on my feet; about me round I saw Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk&#39;d, or flew, Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil&#39;d, With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow&#39;d. My self I then perus&#39;d, and Limb by Limb Survey&#39;d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran With supple joints, as lively vigour led: But who I was, or where, or from what cause, Knew not; to speak I tri&#39;d, and forthwith spake, My Tongue obey&#39;d and readily could name What e&#39;re I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, And thou enlight&#39;nd Earth, so fresh and gay, Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? Not of my self; by some great Maker then, In goodness and in power praeeminent; Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, From whom I have that thus I move and live, And feel that I am happier then I know. While thus I call&#39;d, and stray&#39;d I knew not whither, From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld This happie Light, when answer none return&#39;d, On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep First found me, and with soft oppression seis&#39;d My droused sense, untroubl&#39;d, though I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, Whose inward apparition gently mov&#39;d My Fancy to believe I yet had being, And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, And said, thy Mansion wants thee, ADAM, rise, First Man, of Men innumerable ordain&#39;d First Father, call&#39;d by thee I come thy Guide To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar&#39;d. So saying, by the hand he took me rais&#39;d, And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire Smooth sliding without step, last led me up A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, A Circuit wide, enclos&#39;d, with goodliest Trees Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree Load&#39;n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye Tempting, stirr&#39;d in me sudden appetite To pluck and eate; whereat I wak&#39;d, and found Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide Up hither, from among the Trees appeer&#39;d, Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss: he rear&#39;d me, &amp; Whom thou soughtst I am, Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest Above, or round about thee or beneath. This Paradise I give thee, count it thine To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: Of every Tree that in the Garden growes Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: But of the Tree whose operation brings Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith, Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life, Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, And shun the bitter consequence: for know, The day thou eat&#39;st thereof, my sole command Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; From that day mortal, and this happie State Shalt loose, expell&#39;d from hence into a World Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc&#39;d The rigid interdiction, which resounds Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect Return&#39;d and gratious purpose thus renew&#39;d. Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords Possess it, and all things that therein live, Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.

By Night he fled, and at Midnight return&#39;d From compassing the Earth, cautious of day, Since URIEL Regent of the Sun descri&#39;d His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv&#39;n, The space of seven continu&#39;d Nights he rode With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line He circl&#39;d, four times cross&#39;d the Carr of Night From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure; On the eighth return&#39;d, and on the Coast averse From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth Found unsuspected way. There was a place, Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change, Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life; In with the River sunk, and with it rose Satan involv&#39;d in rising Mist, then sought Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB; Downward as farr Antartic; and in length West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr&#39;d At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam&#39;d With narrow search; and with inspection deep Consider&#39;d every Creature, which of all Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.

With what delight could I have walkt thee round If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines, Now Land, now Sea, &amp; Shores with Forrest crownd, Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these Find place or refuge; and the more I see Pleasures about me, so much more I feel Torment within me, as from the hateful siege Of contraries; all good to me becomes Bane, and in Heav&#39;n much worse would be my state. But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav&#39;n To dwell, unless by maistring Heav&#39;ns Supreame; Nor hope to be my self less miserable By what I seek, but others to make such As I though thereby worse to me redound: For onely in destroying I finde ease To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, Or won to what may work his utter loss, For whom all this was made, all this will soon Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, In wo then; that destruction wide may range: To mee shall be the glorie sole among The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr&#39;d What he ALMIGHTIE styl&#39;d, six Nights and Days Continu&#39;d making, and who knows how long Before had bin contriving, though perhaps Not longer then since I in one Night freed From servitude inglorious welnigh half Th&#39; Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng Of his adorers: hee to be aveng&#39;d, And to repaire his numbers thus impair&#39;d, Whether such vertue spent of old now faild More Angels to Create, if they at least Are his Created or to spite us more, Determin&#39;d to advance into our room A Creature form&#39;d of Earth, and him endow, Exalted from so base original, With Heav&#39;nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed He effected; Man he made, and for him built Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, Him Lord pronounc&#39;d, and, O indignitie!

But God left free the Will, for what obeyes Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, But bid her well beware, and still erect, Least by some faire appeering good surpris&#39;d She dictate false, and missinforme the Will To do what God expresly hath forbid.

O much deceav&#39;d, much failing, hapless EVE, Of thy presum&#39;d return! event perverse! Thou never from that houre in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades Waited with hellish rancor imminent To intercept thy way, or send thee back Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde The onely two of Mankinde, but in them The whole included Race, his purposd prey. In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet He sought them both, but wish&#39;d his hap might find EVE separate, he wish&#39;d, but not with hope Of what so seldom chanc&#39;d, when to his wish, Beyond his hope, EVE separate he spies, Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, Half spi&#39;d, so thick the Roses bushing round About her glowd, oft stooping to support Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh. Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers&#39;d Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen Among thick-wov&#39;n Arborets and Flours Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of EVE: Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign&#39;d Or of reviv&#39;d ADONIS, or renownd ALCINOUS, host of old LAERTES Son, Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King Held dalliance with his faire EGYPTIAN Spouse. Much hee the Place admir&#39;d, the Person more. As one who long in populous City pent, Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, She most, and in her look summs all Delight. Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of EVE Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav&#39;nly forme Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire Of gesture or lest action overawd His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav&#39;d His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: That space the Evil one abstracted stood From his own evil, and for the time remaind Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm&#39;d, Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, Though in mid Heav&#39;n, soon ended his delight, And tortures him now more, the more he sees Of pleasure not for him ordain&#39;d: then soon Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.</p><pre><code>Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet

As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE, To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us&#39;d To such disport before her through the Field, From every Beast, more duteous at her call, Then at CIRCEAN call the Herd disguis&#39;d. Hee boulder now, uncall&#39;d before her stood; But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd His turret Crest, and sleek enamel&#39;d Neck, Fawning, and lick&#39;d the ground whereon she trod.

Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill I spar&#39;d not, for such pleasure till that hour At Feed or Fountain never had I found. Sated at length, ere long I might perceave Strange alteration in me, to degree Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind Considerd all things visible in Heav&#39;n, Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; But all that fair and good in thy Divine Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav&#39;nly Ray United I beheld; no Fair to thine Equivalent or second, which compel&#39;d Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come And gaze, and worship thee of right declar&#39;d Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.</p><pre><code>So talk&#39;d the spirited sly Snake; and EVE

Queen of this Universe, doe not believe Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, Mee who have touch&#39;d and tasted, yet both live, And life more perfet have attaind then Fate Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast Is open? or will God incense his ire For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain Of Death denounc&#39;t, whatever thing Death be, Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, His worshippers; he knows that in the day Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then Op&#39;nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, Internal Man, is but proportion meet, I of brute human, yee of human Gods. So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, Though threat&#39;nd, which no worse then this can bring And what are Gods that Man may not become As they, participating God-like food? The Gods are first, and that advantage use On our belief, that all from them proceeds, I question it, for this fair Earth I see, Warm&#39;d by the Sun, producing every kind, Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos&#39;d Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies Th&#39; offence, that Man should thus attain to know? What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree Impart against his will if all be his? Or is it envie, and can envie dwell In heav&#39;nly brests? these, these and many more Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.</p><pre><code>He ended, and his words replete with guile

In plain then, what forbids he but to know, Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death Bind us with after-bands, what profits then Our inward freedom? In the day we eate Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat&#39;n and lives, And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, Irrational till then. For us alone Was death invented? or to us deni&#39;d This intellectual food, for beasts reserv&#39;d? For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy The good befall&#39;n him, Author unsuspect, Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. What fear I then, rather what know to feare Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?

Greedily she ingorg&#39;d without restraint, And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, And hight&#39;nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, Thus to her self she pleasingly began.</p><pre><code>O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees

Meanwhile ere thus was sin&#39;d and judg&#39;d on Earth, Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, In counterview within the Gates, that now Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame Farr into CHAOS, since the Fiend pass&#39;d through, Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.</p><pre><code>O Son, why sit we here each other viewing

So sented the grim Feature, and upturn&#39;d His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr. Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste Wide Anarchie of CHAOS damp and dark Flew divers, &amp; with Power (thir Power was great) Hovering upon the Waters; what they met Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea Tost up and down, together crowded drove From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse Upon the CRONIAN Sea, together drive Mountains of Ice, that stop th&#39; imagin&#39;d way Beyond PETSORA Eastward, to the rich CATHAIAN Coast. The aggregated Soyle Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, As with a Trident smote, and fix&#39;t as firm As DELOS floating once; the rest his look Bound with GORGONIAN rigor not to move, And with ASPHALTIC slime; broad as the Gate, Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather&#39;d beach They fasten&#39;d, and the Mole immense wraught on Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall Immoveable of this now fenceless world Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.

Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock Over the vext Abyss, following the track Of SATAN, to the selfsame place where hee First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe From out of CHAOS to the outside bare Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made And durable; and now in little space The Confines met of Empyrean Heav&#39;n And of this World, and on the left hand Hell With long reach interpos&#39;d; three sev&#39;ral wayes In sight, to each of these three places led. And now thir way to Earth they had descri&#39;d, To Paradise first tending, when behold SATAN in likeness of an Angel bright Betwixt the CENTAURE and the SCORPION stearing His ZENITH, while the Sun in ARIES rose: Disguis&#39;d he came, but those his Children dear Thir Parent soon discern&#39;d, though in disguise. Hee, after EVE seduc&#39;t, unminded slunk Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act By EVE, though all unweeting, seconded Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought Vain covertures; but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them, terrifi&#39;d Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth Might suddenly inflict; that past, return&#39;d By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood Not instant, but of future time.

Thus began Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first Daughter of Sin, among th&#39; irrational, Death introduc&#39;d through fierce antipathie: Beast now with Beast gan war, &amp; Fowle with Fowle, And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe Of Man, but fled him, or with count&#39;nance grim Glar&#39;d on him passing: these were from without The growing miseries, which ADAM saw Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, And in a troubl&#39;d Sea of passion tost, Thus to disburd&#39;n sought with sad complaint.</p><pre><code>O miserable of happie! is this the end
</code></pre><p>Of this new glorious World, and mee so late The Glory of that Glory, who now becom Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face Of God, whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness: yet well, if here would end The miserie, I deserv&#39;d it, and would beare My own deservings; but this will not serve; All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, Is propagated curse. O voice once heard Delightfully, ENCREASE AND MULTIPLY, Now death to heare! for what can I encrease Or multiplie, but curses on my head? Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling The evil on him brought by me, will curse My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, For this we may thank ADAM; but his thanks Shall be the execration; so besides Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, On mee as on thir natural center light Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee From darkness to promote me, or here place In this delicious Garden? as my Will Concurd not to my being, it were but right And equal to reduce me to my dust, Desirous to resigne, and render back All I receav&#39;d, unable to performe Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold The good I sought not. To the loss of that, Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added The sense of endless woes? inexplicable Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, I thus contest; then should have been refusd Those terms whatever, when they were propos&#39;d: Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, Then cavil the conditions? and though God Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son Prove disobedient, and reprov&#39;d, retort, Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, But Natural necessity begot. God made thee of choice his own, and of his own To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: O welcom hour whenever! why delayes His hand to execute what his Decree Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, Why am I mockt with death, and length&#39;nd out To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth Insensible, how glad would lay me down As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse To mee and to my ofspring would torment me With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man Which God inspir&#39;d, cannot together perish With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, Or in some other dismal place, who knows But I shall die a living Death? O thought Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath Of Life that sinn&#39;d; what dies but what had life And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. All of me then shall die: let this appease The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. For though the Lord of all be infinite, Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, But mortal doom&#39;d. How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? Can he make deathless Death? that were to make Strange contradiction, which to God himself Impossible is held, as Argument Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, For angers sake, finite to infinite In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour Satisfi&#39;d never; that were to extend His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, By which all Causes else according still To the reception of thir matter act, Not to th&#39; extent of thir own Spheare. But say That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos&#39;d, Bereaving sense, but endless miserie From this day onward, which I feel begun Both in me, and without me, and so last To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution On my defensless head; both Death and I Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, Nor I on my part single, in mee all Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! So disinherited how would ye bless Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn&#39;d, If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed, But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav&#39;d, Not to do onely, but to will the same With me? how can they acquitted stand In sight of God? Him after all Disputes Forc&#39;t I absolve: all my evasions vain And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still But to my own conviction: first and last On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, Then all the world much heavier, though divided With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir&#39;st, And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future, To SATAN onely like both crime and doom. O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears And horrors hast thou driv&#39;n me; out of which I find no way, from deep to deeper plung&#39;d!</p><pre><code>Thus ADAM to himself lamented loud

This most afflicts me, that departing hence, As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd His blessed count&#39;nance; here I could frequent, With worship, place by place where he voutsaf&#39;d Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree Stood visible, among these Pines his voice I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk&#39;d: So many grateful Altars I would reare Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, Or monument to Ages, and thereon Offer sweet smelling Gumms &amp; Fruits and Flours: In yonder nether World where shall I seek His bright appearances, or footstep trace? For though I fled him angrie, yet recall&#39;d To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.</p><pre><code>To whom thus MICHAEL with regard benigne.
</code></pre><p>ADAM, thou know&#39;st Heav&#39;n his, and all the Earth Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: All th&#39; Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, No despicable gift; surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confin&#39;d Of Paradise or EDEN: this had been Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred All generations, and had hither come From all the ends of th&#39; Earth, to celebrate And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine God is as here, and will be found alike Present, and of his presence many a signe Still following thee, still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal Love, his Face Express, and of his steps the track Divine. Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent To shew thee what shall come in future dayes To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn True patience, and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow, equally enur&#39;d By moderation either state to beare, Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead Safest thy life, and best prepar&#39;d endure Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend This Hill; let EVE (for I have drencht her eyes) Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak&#39;st, As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.</p><pre><code>To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli&#39;d.

So both ascend In the Visions of God: It was a Hill Of Paradise the highest, from whose top The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, Whereon for different cause the Tempter set Our second ADAM in the Wilderness, To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. His Eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern Fame, the Seat Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls Of CAMBALU, seat of CATHAIAN CAN And SAMARCHAND by OXUS, TEMIRS Throne, To PAQUIN of SINAEAN Kings, and thence To AGRA and LAHOR of great MOGUL Down to the golden CHERSONESE, or where The PERSIAN in ECBATAN sate, or since In HISPAHAN, or where the RUSSIAN KSAR In MOSCO, or the Sultan in BIZANCE, TURCHESTAN-born; nor could his eye not ken Th&#39; Empire of NEGUS to his utmost Port ERCOCO and the less Maritine Kings MOMBAZA, and QUILOA, and MELIND, And SOFALA thought OPHIR, to the Realme Of CONGO, and ANGOLA fardest South; Or thence from NIGER Flood to ATLAS Mount The Kingdoms of ALMANSOR, FEZ, and SUS, MAROCCO and ALGIERS, and TREMISEN; On EUROPE thence, and where ROME was to sway The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw Rich MEXICO the seat of MOTEZUME, And CUSCO in PERU, the richer seat Of ATABALIPA, and yet unspoil&#39;d GUIANA, whose great Citie GERYONS Sons Call EL DORADO: but to nobler sights MICHAEL from ADAMS eyes the Filme remov&#39;d VVhich that false Fruit that promis&#39;d clearer sight Had bred; then purg&#39;d with Euphrasie and Rue The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; And from the VVell of Life three drops instill&#39;d. So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc&#39;d, Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, That ADAM now enforc&#39;t to close his eyes, Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: But him the gentle Angel by the hand Soon rais&#39;d, and his attention thus recall&#39;d.</p><pre><code>ADAM, now ope thine eyes, and first behold

</code></pre><p>Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; Ith&#39; midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, Uncull&#39;d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew&#39;d, On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform&#39;d. His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav&#39;n Consum&#39;d with nimble glance, and grateful steame; The others not, for his was not sincere; Whereat hee inlie rag&#39;d, and as they talk&#39;d, Smote him into the Midriff with a stone That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus&#39;d. Much at that sight was ADAM in his heart Dismai&#39;d, and thus in haste to th&#39; Angel cri&#39;d.</p><pre><code>O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall&#39;n

To which our Sire.</p><pre><code>Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!

</code></pre><p>In his first shape on man; but many shapes Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense More terrible at th&#39; entrance then within. Some, as thou saw&#39;st, by violent stroke shall die, By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know What miserie th&#39; inabstinence of EVE Shall bring on men. Immediately a place Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid Numbers of all diseas&#39;d, all maladies Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, Dropsies, and Asthma&#39;s, and Joint-racking Rheums. Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; And over them triumphant Death his Dart Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok&#39;t With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long Drie-ey&#39;d behold? ADAM could not, but wept, Though not of Woman born; compassion quell&#39;d His best of Man, and gave him up to tears A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, And scarce recovering words his plaint renew&#39;d.</p><pre><code>O miserable Mankind, to what fall

Why is life giv&#39;n To be thus wrested from us? rather why Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew What we receive, would either not accept Life offer&#39;d, or soon beg to lay it down, Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus Th&#39; Image of God in man created once So goodly and erect, though faultie since, To such unsightly sufferings be debas&#39;t Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, Retaining still Divine similitude In part, from such deformities be free, And for his Makers Image sake exempt?</p><pre><code>Thir Makers Image, answerd MICHAEL, then
</code></pre><p>Forsook them, when themselves they villifi&#39;d To serve ungovern&#39;d appetite, and took His Image whom they serv&#39;d, a brutish vice, Inductive mainly to the sin of EVE. Therefore so abject is thir punishment, Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, Or if his likeness, by themselves defac&#39;t While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.</p><pre><code>I yeild it just, said ADAM, and submit.

</code></pre><p>The rule of not too much, by temperance taught In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, Till many years over thy head return: So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: This is old age; but then thou must outlive Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change To witherd weak &amp; gray; thy Senses then Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne A melancholly damp of cold and dry To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor.</p><pre><code>Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong

</code></pre><p>Live well, how long or short permit to Heav&#39;n: And now prepare thee for another sight.</p><pre><code>He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon
</code></pre><p>Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound Of Instruments that made melodious chime Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch Instinct through all proportions low and high Fled and pursu&#39;d transverse the resonant fugue. In other part stood one who at the Forge Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind Into fit moulds prepar&#39;d; from which he formd First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought Fulfil or grav&#39;n in mettle. After these, But on the hether side a different sort From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent To worship God aright, and know his works Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: The Men though grave, ey&#39;d them, and let thir eyes Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net Fast caught, they lik&#39;d, and each his liking chose; And now of love they treat till th&#39; Eevning Star Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok&#39;t; With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. Such happy interview and fair event Of love &amp; youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, And charming Symphonies attach&#39;d the heart Of ADAM, soon enclin&#39;d to admit delight, The bent of Nature; which he thus express&#39;d.</p><pre><code>True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,
</code></pre><p>Much better seems this Vision, and more hope Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.</p><pre><code>To whom thus MICHAEL.  Judg not what is best
</code></pre><p>By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, Created, as thou art, to nobler end Holie and pure, conformitie divine. Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race Who slew his Brother; studious they appere Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg&#39;d none. Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, Yet empty of all good wherein consists Womans domestic honour and chief praise; Bred onely and completed to the taste Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives Religious titl&#39;d them the Sons of God, Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.</p><pre><code>To whom thus ADAM of short joy bereft.
</code></pre><p>O pittie and shame, that they who to live well Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! But still I see the tenor of Mans woe Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.</p><pre><code>From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,
</code></pre><p>Said th&#39; Angel, who should better hold his place By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. But now prepare thee for another Scene.</p><pre><code>He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred
</code></pre><p>Before him, Towns, and rural works between, Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, Single or in Array of Battel rang&#39;d Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; One way a Band select from forage drives A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; Where Cattel pastur&#39;d late, now scatterd lies With Carcasses and Arms th&#39; ensanguind Field Deserted: Others to a Citie strong Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, Assaulting; others from the Wall defend With Dart and Jav&#39;lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. In other part the scepter&#39;d Haralds call To Council in the Citie Gates: anon Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon In factious opposition, till at last Of middle Age one rising, eminent In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, And Judgement from above: him old and young Exploded, and had seiz&#39;d with violent hands, Had not a Cloud descending snatch&#39;d him thence Unseen amid the throng: so violence Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. ADAM was all in tears, and to his guide Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death Inhumanly to men, and multiply Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew His Brother; for of whom such massacher Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav&#39;n Rescu&#39;d, had in his Righteousness bin lost?</p><pre><code>To whom thus MICHAEL; These are the product
</code></pre><p>Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw&#39;st; Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. Such were these Giants, men of high renown; For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir&#39;d, And Valour and Heroic Vertu call&#39;d; To overcome in Battel, and subdue Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done Of triumph, to be styl&#39;d great Conquerours, Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, Destroyers rightlier call&#39;d and Plagues of men. Thus Fame shall be achiev&#39;d, renown on Earth, And what most merits fame in silence hid. But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst The onely righteous in a World perverse, And therefore hated, therefore so beset With Foes for daring single to be just, And utter odious Truth, that God would come To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.</p><pre><code>He look&#39;d, &amp; saw the face of things quite chang&#39;d;
</code></pre><p>The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, All now was turn&#39;d to jollitie and game, To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, Marrying or prostituting, as befell, Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. At length a Reverend Sire among them came, And of thir doings great dislike declar&#39;d, And testifi&#39;d against thir wayes; hee oft Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls In prison under Judgements imminent: But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas&#39;d Contending, and remov&#39;d his Tents farr off; Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, Measur&#39;d by Cubit, length, &amp; breadth, and highth, Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore Contriv&#39;d, and of provisions laid in large For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. Meanwhile the Southwind rose, &amp; with black wings Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove From under Heav&#39;n; the Hills to their supplie Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, Sent up amain; and now the thick&#39;nd Skie Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush&#39;d the Rain Impetuous, and continu&#39;d till the Earth No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting o&#39;re the Waves, all dwellings else Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp Deep under water rould; Sea cover&#39;d Sea, Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces Where luxurie late reign&#39;d, Sea-monsters whelp&#39;d And stabl&#39;d; of Mankind, so numerous late, All left, in one small bottom swum imbark&#39;t. How didst thou grieve then, ADAM, to behold The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, Depopulation; thee another Floud, Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown&#39;d, And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard By th&#39; Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; And scarce to th&#39; Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.</p><pre><code>O Visions ill foreseen! better had I

Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, And hee the future evil shall no less In apprehension then in substance feel Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, Man is not whom to warne: those few escap&#39;t Famin and anguish will at last consume Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope When violence was ceas&#39;t, and Warr on Earth, All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd With length of happy days the race of man; But I was farr deceav&#39;d; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, And whether here the Race of man will end. To whom thus MICHAEL. Those whom last thou sawst In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they First seen in acts of prowess eminent And great exploits, but of true vertu void; Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. The conquerd also, and enslav&#39;d by Warr Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign&#39;d In sharp contest of Battel found no aide Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords Shall leave them to enjoy; for th&#39; Earth shall bear More then anough, that temperance may be tri&#39;d: So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav&#39;d, Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; One Man except, the onely Son of light In a dark Age, against example good, Against allurement, custom, and a World Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes Shall them admonish, and before them set The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come On thir impenitence; and shall returne Of them derided, but of God observd The one just Man alive; by his command Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, To save himself and houshold from amidst A World devote to universal rack. No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg&#39;d, And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts Of Heav&#39;n set open on the Earth shall powre Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, With all his verdure spoil&#39;d, and Trees adrift Down the great River to the op&#39;ning Gulf, And there take root an Iland salt and bare, The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctitie, if none be thither brought By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. And now what further shall ensue, behold.</p><pre><code>He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,
</code></pre><p>Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie Wrinkl&#39;d the face of Deluge, as decai&#39;d; And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass Gaz&#39;d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt His Sluces, as the Heav&#39;n his windows shut. The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, And after him, the surer messenger, A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; The second time returning, in his Bill An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, Grateful to Heav&#39;n, over his head beholds A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, Betok&#39;ning peace from God, and Cov&#39;nant new. Whereat the heart of ADAM erst so sad Greatly rejoyc&#39;d, and thus his joy broke forth.</p><pre><code>O thou that future things canst represent
</code></pre><p>As present, Heav&#39;nly instructer, I revive At this last sight, assur&#39;d that Man shall live With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. Farr less I now lament for one whole World Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce For one Man found so perfet and so just, That God voutsafes to raise another World From him, and all his anger to forget. But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, Distended as the Brow of God appeas&#39;d, Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?</p><pre><code>To whom th&#39; Archangel.

Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end; And Man as from a second stock proceed. Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense: Henceforth what is to com I will relate, Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. This second sours of Men, while yet but few, And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie, With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, With large Wine-offerings pour&#39;d, and sacred Feast Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam&#39;d, and dwell Long time in peace by Families and Tribes Under paternal rule; till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart, who not content With fair equalitie, fraternal state, Will arrogate Dominion undeserv&#39;d Over his brethren, and quite dispossess Concord and law of Nature from the Earth; Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game) With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse Subjection to his Empire tyrannous: A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl&#39;d Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav&#39;n, Or from Heav&#39;n claming second Sovrantie; And from Rebellion shall derive his name, Though of Rebellion others he accuse. Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns With him or under him to tyrannize, Marching from EDEN towards the West, shall finde The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell; Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build A Citie &amp; Towre, whose top may reach to Heav&#39;n; And get themselves a name, least far disperst In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost, Regardless whether good or evil fame. But God who oft descends to visit men Unseen, and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings, them beholding soon, Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower Obstruct Heav&#39;n Towrs, and in derision sets Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase Quite out thir Native Language, and instead To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud Among the Builders; each to other calls Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav&#39;n And looking down, to see the hubbub strange And hear the din; thus was the building left Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam&#39;d.</p><pre><code>Whereto thus ADAM fatherly displeas&#39;d.

But this Usurper his encroachment proud Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food Will he convey up thither to sustain Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross, And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?</p><pre><code>To whom thus MICHAEL.

Therefore since hee permits Within himself unworthie Powers to reign Over free Reason, God in Judgement just Subjects him from without to violent Lords; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be, Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, But Justice, and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie, Thir inward lost: Witness th&#39; irreverent Son Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse, SERVANT OF SERVANTS, on his vitious Race. Thus will this latter, as the former World, Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw His presence from among them, and avert His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes; And one peculiar Nation to select From all the rest, of whom to be invok&#39;d, A Nation from one faithful man to spring: Him on this side EUPHRATES yet residing, Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, While yet the Patriark liv&#39;d, who scap&#39;d the Flood, As to forsake the living God, and fall To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes To call by Vision from his Fathers house, His kindred and false Gods, into a Land Which he will shew him, and from him will raise A mightie Nation, and upon him showre His benediction so, that in his Seed All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys, Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile UR of CHALDAEA, passing now the Ford To HARAN, after him a cumbrous Train Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth With God, who call&#39;d him, in a land unknown. CANAAN he now attains, I see his Tents Pitcht about SECHEM, and the neighbouring Plaine Of MOREB; there by promise he receaves Gift to his Progenie of all that Land; From HAMATH Northward to the Desert South (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam&#39;d) From HERMON East to the great Western Sea, Mount HERMON, yonder Sea, each place behold In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare Mount CARMEL; here the double-founted stream JORDAN, true limit Eastward; but his Sons Shall dwell to SENIR, that long ridge of Hills. This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest, Whom FAITHFUL ABRAHAM due time shall call, A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves, Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs From CANAAN, to a Land hereafter call&#39;d EGYPT, divided by the River NILE; See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger Son In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that Realme Of PHARAO: there he dies, and leaves his Race Growing into a Nation, and now grown Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males: Till by two brethren (those two brethren call MOSES and AARON) sent from God to claime His people from enthralment, they return With glory and spoile back to thir promis&#39;d Land. But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies To know thir God, or message to regard, Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire; To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd, Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill With loath&#39;d intrusion, and fill all the land; His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile, Haile mixt with fire must rend th&#39; EGYPTIAN Skie And wheel on th&#39; Earth, devouring where it rouls; What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine, A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born Of EGYPT must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds This River-dragon tam&#39;d at length submits To let his sojourners depart, and oft Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice More hard&#39;nd after thaw, till in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass As on drie land between two christal walls, Aw&#39;d by the rod of MOSES so to stand Divided, till his rescu&#39;d gain thir shoar: Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, Though present in his Angel, who shall goe Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, To guide them in thir journey, and remove Behinde them, while th&#39; obdurat King pursues: All night he will pursue, but his approach Darkness defends between till morning Watch; Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud God looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command MOSES once more his potent Rod extends Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys; On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return, And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect Safe towards CANAAN from the shoar advance Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way, Least entring on the CANAANITE allarmd Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare Return them back to EGYPT, choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. This also shall they gain by thir delay In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found Thir government, and thir great Senate choose Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind: God from the Mount of SINAI, whose gray top Shall tremble, he descending, will himself In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine To civil Justice, part religious Rites Of sacrifice, informing them, by types And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech That MOSES might report to them his will, And terror cease; he grants them thir desire, Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator, whose high Office now MOSES in figure beares, to introduce One greater, of whose day he shall foretell, And all the Prophets in thir Age the times Of great MESSIAH shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites Establisht, such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes Among them to set up his Tabernacle, The holy One with mortal Men to dwell: By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram&#39;d Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony, The Records of his Cov&#39;nant, over these A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing The Heav&#39;nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night, Save when they journie, and at length they come, Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to ABRAHAM and his Seed: the rest Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won, Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav&#39;n stand still A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne, Mans voice commanding, Sun in GIBEON stand, And thou Moon in the vale of AIALON, Till ISRAEL overcome; so call the third From ABRAHAM, Son of ISAAC, and from him His whole descent, who thus shall CANAAN win.</p><pre><code>Here ADAM interpos&#39;d.

This yet I apprehend not, why to those Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth So many and so various Laws are giv&#39;n; So many Laws argue so many sins Among them; how can God with such reside?</p><pre><code>To whom thus MICHAEL.  Doubt not but that sin

So Law appears imperfet, and but giv&#39;n With purpose to resign them in full time Up to a better Cov&#39;nant, disciplin&#39;d From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, From imposition of strict Laws, to free Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. And therefore shall not MOSES, though of God Highly belov&#39;d, being but the Minister Of Law, his people into CANAAN lead; But JOSHUA whom the Gentiles JESUS call, His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell The adversarie Serpent, and bring back Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. Meanwhile they in thir earthly CANAAN plac&#39;t Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins National interrupt thir public peace, Provoking God to raise them enemies: From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom The second, both for pietie renownd And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne For ever shall endure; the like shall sing All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock Of DAVID (so I name this King) shall rise A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, Foretold to ABRAHAM, as in whom shall trust All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. But first a long succession must ensue, And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam&#39;d, The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. Such follow him, as shall be registerd Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw&#39;st Left in confusion, BABYLON thence call&#39;d. There in captivitie he lets them dwell The space of seventie years, then brings them back, Remembring mercie, and his Cov&#39;nant sworn To DAVID, stablisht as the dayes of Heav&#39;n. Returnd from BABYLON by leave of Kings Thir Lords, whom God dispos&#39;d, the house of God They first re-edifie, and for a while In mean estate live moderate, till grown In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; But first among the Priests dissension springs, Men who attend the Altar, and should most Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise The Scepter, and regard not DAVIDS Sons, Then loose it to a stranger, that the true Anointed King MESSIAH might be born Barr&#39;d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr Unseen before in Heav&#39;n proclaims him com, And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire The Power of the most High; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav&#39;ns.</p><pre><code>He ceas&#39;d, discerning ADAM with such joy

The Law of God exact he shall fulfill Both by obedience and by love, though love Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment He shall endure by coming in the Flesh To a reproachful life and cursed death, Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe In his redemption, and that his obedience Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits To save them, not thir own, though legal works. For this he shall live hated, be blasphem&#39;d, Seis&#39;d on by force, judg&#39;d, and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, The Law that is against thee, and the sins Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi&#39;d, Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction; so he dies, But soon revives, Death over him no power Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, His death for Man, as many as offerd Life Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace By Faith not void of works: this God-like act Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy&#39;d, In sin for ever lost from life; this act Shall bruise the head of SATAN, crush his strength Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, A gentle wafting to immortal Life. Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer To his Disciples, Men who in his Life Still follow&#39;d him; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learn&#39;d And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life Pure, and in mind prepar&#39;d, if so befall, For death, like that which the redeemer dy&#39;d. All Nations they shall teach; for from that day Not onely to the Sons of ABRAHAMS Loines Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons Of ABRAHAMS Faith wherever through the world; So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. Then to the Heav&#39;n of Heav&#39;ns he shall ascend With victory, triumphing through the aire Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines Through all his realme, &amp; there confounded leave; Then enter into glory, and resume His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high Above all names in Heav&#39;n; and thence shall come, When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe, With glory and power to judge both quick &amp; dead, To judge th&#39; unfaithful dead, but to reward His faithful, and receave them into bliss, Whether in Heav&#39;n or Earth, for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise, far happier place Then this of EDEN, and far happier daies.</p><pre><code>So spake th&#39; Archangel MICHAEL, then paus&#39;d,

But say, if our deliverer up to Heav&#39;n Must reascend, what will betide the few His faithful, left among th&#39; unfaithful herd, The enemies of truth; who then shall guide His people, who defend? will they not deale Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?</p><pre><code>Be sure they will, said th&#39; Angel; but from Heav&#39;n

Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heav&#39;n: at length Thir Ministry perform&#39;d, and race well run, Thir doctrine and thir story written left, They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav&#39;n To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition, and the truth With superstitions and traditions taint, Left onely in those written Records pure, Though not but by the Spirit understood. Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, Places and titles, and with these to joine Secular power, though feigning still to act By spiritual, to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv&#39;n To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible? yet many will presume: Whence heavie persecution shall arise On all who in the worship persevere Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes Religion satisfi&#39;d; Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, To good malignant, to bad men benigne, Under her own waight groaning, till the day Appeer of respiration to the just, And vengeance to the wicked, at return Of him so lately promis&#39;d to thy aid, The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, Last in the Clouds from Heav&#39;n to be reveald In glory of the Father, to dissolve SATAN with his perverted World, then raise From the conflagrant mass, purg&#39;d and refin&#39;d, New Heav&#39;ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love, To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.</p><pre><code>He ended; and thus ADAM last reply&#39;d.
