</code></pre><p>Like millions of my race, my mother and father were born slaves, but were not contented to live and die so. My father purchased himself in early manhood by hard toil. Mother saw no way for herself and children to escape the horrors of bondage but by flight. Bravely, with her four little ones, with firm faith in God and an ardent desire to be free, she forsook the prison-house, and succeeded, through the aid of my father, to reach a free State. Here life had to be begun anew. The old familiar slave names had to be changed, and others, for prudential reasons, had to be found. This was not hard work. However, hardly months had passed ere the keen scent of the slave-hunters had trailed them to where they had fancied themselves secure. In those days all power was in the hands of the oppressor, and the capture of a slave mother and her children was attended with no great difficulty other than the crushing of freedom in the breast of the victims. Without judge or jury, all were hurried back to wear the yoke again. But back this mother was resolved never to stay. She only wanted another opportunity to again strike for freedom. In a few months after being carried back, with only two of her little ones, she took her heart in her hand and her babes in her arms, and this trial was a success. Freedom was gained, although not without the sad loss of her two older children, whom she had to leave behind. Mother and father were again reunited in freedom, while two of their little boys were in slavery. What to do for them other than weep and pray, were questions unanswerable. For over forty years the mother&#39;s heart never knew what it was to be free from anxiety about her lost boys. But no tidings came in answer to her many prayers, until one of them, to the great astonishment of his relatives, turned up in Philadelphia, nearly fifty years of age, seeking his long-lost parents. Being directed to the Anti-Slavery Office for instructions as to the best plan to adopt to find out the whereabouts of his parents, fortunately he fell into the hands of his own brother, the writer, whom he had never heard of before, much less seen or known. And here began revelations connected with this marvellous coincidence, which influenced me, for years previous to Emancipation, to preserve the matter found in the pages of this humble volume.</p><p>And in looking back now over these strange and eventful Providences, in the light of the wonderful changes wrought by Emancipation, I am more and more constrained to believe that the reasons, which years ago led me to aid the bondman and preserve the records of his sufferings, are to-day quite as potent in convincing me that the necessity of the times requires this testimony.</p><p>And since the first advent of my book, wherever reviewed or read by leading friends of freedom, the press, or the race more deeply represented by it, the expressions of approval and encouragement have been hearty and unanimous, and the thousands of volumes which have been sold by me, on the subscription plan, with hardly any facilities for the work, makes it obvious that it would, in the hands of a competent publisher, have a wide circulation.</p><p>And here I may frankly state, that but for the hope I have always cherished that this work would encourage the race in efforts for self-elevation, its publication never would have been undertaken by me.</p><p>I believe no more strongly at this moment than I have believed ever since the Proclamation of Emancipation was made by Abraham Lincoln, that as a class, in this country, no small exertion will have to be put forth before the blessings of freedom and knowledge can be fairly enjoyed by this people; and until colored men manage by dint of hard acquisition to enter the ranks of skilled industry, very little substantial respect will be shown them, even with the ballot-box and musket in their hands.</p><p>Well-conducted shops and stores; lands acquired and good farms managed in a manner to compete with any other; valuable books produced and published on interesting and important subjects--these are some of the fruits which the race are expected to exhibit from their newly gained privileges.</p><p>If it is asked &quot;how?&quot; I answer, &quot;through extraordinary determination and endeavor,&quot; such as are demonstrated in hundreds of cases in the pages of this book, in the struggles of men and women to obtain their freedom, education and property.</p><p>These facts must never be lost sight of.</p><p>The race must not forget the rock from whence they were hewn, nor the pit from whence, they were digged.</p><p>Like other races, this newly emancipated people will need all the knowledge of their past condition which they can get.</p><p>The bondage and deliverance of the children of Israel will never be allowed to sink into oblivion while the world stands.</p><p>Those scenes of suffering and martyrdom millions of Christians were called upon to pass through in the days of the Inquisition are still subjects of study, and have unabated interest for all enlightened minds.</p><p>The same is true of the history of this country. The struggles of the pioneer fathers are preserved, produced and re-produced, and cherished with undying interest by all Americans, and the day will not arrive while the Republic exists, when these histories will not be found in every library.</p><p>While the grand little army of abolitionists was waging its untiring warfare for freedom, prior to the rebellion, no agency encouraged them like the heroism of fugitives. The pulse of the four millions of slaves and their desire for freedom, were better felt through &quot;The Underground Railroad,&quot; than through any other channel.</p><p>Frederick Douglass, Henry Bibb, Wm. Wells Brown, Rev. J.W. Logan, and others, gave unmistakable evidence that the race had no more eloquent advocates than its own self-emancipated champions.</p><p>Every step they took to rid themselves of their fetters, or to gain education, or in pleading the cause of their fellow-bondmen in the lecture-room, or with their pens, met with applause on every hand, and the very argument needed was thus furnished in large measure. In those dark days previous to emancipation, such testimony was indispensable.</p><p>The free colored men are as imperatively required now to furnish the same manly testimony in support of the ability of the race to surmount the remaining obstacles growing out of oppression, ignorance, and poverty.</p><p>In the political struggles, the hopes of the race have been sadly disappointed. From this direction no great advantage is likely to arise very soon.</p><p>Only as desert can be proved by the acquisition of knowledge and the exhibition of high moral character, in examples of economy and a disposition to encourage industrial enterprises, conducted by men of their own ranks, will it be possible to make political progress in the face of the present public sentiment.</p><p>Here, therefore, in my judgment is the best possible reason for vigorously pushing the circulation of this humble volume--that it may testify for thousands and tens of thousands, as no other work can do.</p><p>WILLIAM STILL, Author.</p><p>September, 1878.

</code></pre><p>SETH CONCKLIN.</p><p>In the long list of names who have suffered and died in the cause of freedom, not one, perhaps, could be found whose efforts to redeem a poor family of slaves were more Christlike than Seth Concklin&#39;s, whose noble and daring spirit has been so long completely shrouded in mystery. Except John Brown, it is a question, whether his rival could be found with respect to boldness, disinterestedness and willingness to be sacrificed for the deliverance of the oppressed.</p><p>By chance one day he came across a copy of the Pennsylvania Freeman, containing the story of Peter Still, &quot;the Kidnapped and the Ransomed,&quot;--how he had been torn away from his mother, when a little boy six years old; how, for forty years and more, he had been compelled to serve under the yoke, totally destitute as to any knowledge of his parents&#39; whereabouts; how the intense love of liberty and desire to get back to his mother had unceasingly absorbed his mind through all these years of bondage; how, amid the most appalling discouragements, prompted alone by his undying determination to be free and be reunited with those from whom he had been sold away, he contrived to buy himself; how, by extreme economy, from doing over-work, he saved up five hundred dollars, the amount of money required for his ransom, which, with his freedom, he, from necessity, placed unreservedly in the confidential keeping of a Jew, named Joseph Friedman, whom he had known for a long time and could venture to trust,--how he had further toiled to save up money to defray his expenses on an expedition in search of his mother and kindred; how, when this end was accomplished, with an earnest purpose he took his carpet-bag in his hand, and his heart throbbing for his old home and people, he turned his mind very privately towards Philadelphia, where he hoped, by having notices read in the colored churches to the effect that &quot;forty-one or forty-two years before two little boys[A] were kidnapped and carried South&quot;--that the memory of some of the older members might recall the circumstances, and in this way he would be aided in his ardent efforts to become restored to them.</p><p>[Footnote A: Sons of Levin and Sidney--the last names of his parents he was too young to remember.]</p><p>And, furthermore, Seth Concklin had read how, on arriving in Philadelphia, after traveling sixteen hundred miles, that almost the first man whom Peter Still sought advice from was his own unknown brother (whom he had never seen or heard of), who made the discovery that he was the long-lost boy, whose history and fate had been enveloped in sadness so long, and for whom his mother had shed so many tears and offered so many prayers, during the long years of their separation; and, finally, how this self-ransomed and restored captive, notwithstanding his great success, was destined to suffer the keenest pangs of sorrow for his wife and children, whom he had left in Alabama bondage.</p><p>Seth Concklin was naturally too singularly sympathetic and humane not to feel now for Peter, and especially for his wife and children left in bonds as bound with them. Hence, as Seth was a man who seemed wholly insensible to fear, and to know no other law of humanity and right, than whenever the claims of the suffering and the wronged appealed to him, to respond unreservedly, whether those thus injured were amongst his nearest kin or the greatest strangers,--it mattered not to what race or clime they might belong,--he, in the spirit of the good Samaritan, owning all such as his neighbors, volunteered his services, without pay or reward, to go and rescue the wife and three children of Peter Still.</p><p>The magnitude of this offer can hardly be appreciated. It was literally laying his life on the altar of freedom for the despised and oppressed whom he had never seen, whose kins-folk even he was not acquainted with. At this juncture even Peter was not prepared to accept this proposal. He wanted to secure the freedom of his wife and children as earnestly as he had ever desired to see his mother, yet he could not, at first, hearken to the idea of having them rescued in the way suggested by Concklin, fearing a failure.</p><p>To J.M. McKim and the writer, the bold scheme for the deliverance of Peter&#39;s family was alone confided. It was never submitted to the Vigilance Committee, for the reason, that it was not considered a matter belonging thereto. On first reflection, the very idea of such an undertaking seemed perfectly appalling. Frankly was he told of the great dangers and difficulties to be encountered through hundreds of miles of slave territory. Seth was told of those who, in attempting to aid slaves to escape had fallen victims to the relentless Slave Power, and had either lost their lives, or been incarcerated for long years in penitentiaries, where no friendly aid could be afforded them; in short, he was plainly told, that without a very great chance, the undertaking would cost him his life. The occasion of this interview and conversation, the seriousness of Concklin and the utter failure in presenting the various obstacles to his plan, to create the slightest apparent misgiving in his mind, or to produce the slightest sense of fear or hesitancy, can never be effaced from the memory of the writer. The plan was, however, allowed to rest for a time.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Peter&#39;s mind was continually vacillating between Alabama, with his wife and children, and his new-found relatives in the North. Said a brother, &quot;If you cannot get your family, what will you do? Will you come North and live with your relatives?&quot; &quot;I would as soon go out of the world, as not to go back and do all I can for them,&quot; was the prompt reply of Peter.</p><p>The problem of buying them was seriously considered, but here obstacles quite formidable lay in the way. Alabama laws utterly denied the right of a slave to buy himself, much less his wife and children. The right of slave masters to free their slaves, either by sale or emancipation, was positively prohibited by law. With these reflections weighing upon his mind, having stayed away from his wife as long as he could content himself to do, he took his carpet-bag in his hand, and turned his face toward Alabama, to embrace his family in the prison-house of bondage.</p><p>His approach home could only be made stealthily, not daring to breathe to a living soul, save his own family, his nominal Jew master, and one other friend--a slave--where he had been, the prize he had found, or anything in relation to his travels. To his wife and children his return was unspeakably joyous. The situation of his family concerned him with tenfold more weight than ever before,</p><p>As the time drew near to make the offer to his wife&#39;s master to purchase her with his children, his heart failed him through fear of awakening the ire of slaveholders against him, as he knew that the law and public sentiment were alike deadly opposed to the spirit of freedom in the slave. Indeed, as innocent as a step in this direction might appear, in those days a man would have stood about as good a chance for his life in entering a lair of hungry hyenas, as a slave or free colored man would, in talking about freedom.</p><p>He concluded, therefore, to say nothing about buying. The plan proposed by Seth Concklin was told to Vina, his wife; also what he had heard from his brother about the Underground Rail Road,--how, that many who could not get their freedom in any other way, by being aided a little, were daily escaping to Canada. Although the wife and children had never tasted the pleasures of freedom for a single hour in their lives, they hated slavery heartily, and being about to be far separated from husband and father, they were ready to assent to any proposition that looked like deliverance.</p><p>So Peter proposed to Vina, that she should give him certain small articles, consisting of a cape, etc., which he would carry with him as memorials, and, in case Concklin or any one else should ever come for her from him, as an unmistakable sign that all was right, he would send back, by whoever was to befriend them, the cape, so that she and the children might not doubt but have faith in the man, when he gave her the sign, (cape).</p><p>Again Peter returned to Philadelphia, and was now willing to accept the offer of Concklin. Ere long, the opportunity of an interview was had, and Peter gave Seth a very full description of the country and of his family, and made known to him, that he had very carefully gone over with his wife and children the matter of their freedom. This interview interested Concklin most deeply. If his own wife and children had been in bondage, scarcely could he have manifested greater sympathy for them.</p><p>For the hazardous work before him he was at once prepared to make a start. True he had two sisters in Philadelphia for whom he had always cherished the warmest affection, but he conferred not with them on this momentous mission. For full well did he know that it was not in human nature for them to acquiesce in this perilous undertaking, though one of these sisters, Mrs. Supplee, was a most faithful abolitionist.</p><p>Having once laid his hand to the plough he was not the man to look back,--not even to bid his sisters good-bye, but he actually left them as though he expected to be home to his dinner as usual. What had become of him during those many weeks of his perilous labors in Alabama to rescue this family was to none a greater mystery than to his sisters. On leaving home he simply took two or three small articles in the way of apparel with one hundred dollars to defray his expenses for a time; this sum he considered ample to start with. Of course he had very safely concealed about him Vina&#39;s cape and one or two other articles which he was to use for his identification in meeting her and the children on the plantation.</p><p>His first thought was, on reaching his destination, after becoming acquainted with the family, being familiar with Southern manners, to have them all prepared at a given hour for the starting of the steamboat for Cincinnati, and to join him at the wharf, when he would boldly assume the part of a slaveholder, and the family naturally that of slaves, and in this way he hoped to reach Cincinnati direct, before their owner had fairly discovered their escape.</p><p>But alas for Southern irregularity, two or three days&#39; delay after being advertised to start, was no uncommon circumstance with steamers; hence this plan was abandoned. What this heroic man endured from severe struggles and unyielding exertions, in traveling thousands of miles on water and on foot, hungry and fatigued, rowing his living freight for seven days and seven nights in a skiff, is hardly to be paralleled in the annals of the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>The following interesting letters penned by the hand of Concklin convey minutely his last struggles and characteristically represent the singleness of heart which impelled him to sacrifice his life for the slave--</p><p>EASTPORT, MISS., FEB. 3, 1851.</p><p>To Wm. Still:--Our friends in Cincinnati have failed finding anybody to assist me on my return. Searching the country opposite Paducah, I find that the whole country fifty miles round is inhabited only by Christian wolves. It is customary, when a strange negro is seen, for any white man to seize the negro and convey such negro through and out of the State of Illinois to Paducah, Ky., and lodge such stranger in Paducah jail, and there claim such reward as may be offered by the master.</p><p>There is no regularity by the steamboats on the Tennessee River. I was four days getting to Florence from Paducah. Sometimes they are four days starting, from the time appointed, which alone puts to rest the plan for returning by steamboat. The distance from the mouth of the river to Florence, is from between three hundred and five to three hundred and forty-five miles by the river; by land, two hundred and fifty, or more.</p><p>I arrived at the shoe shop on the plantation, one o&#39;clock, Tuesday, 28th. William and two boys were making shoes. I immediately gave the first signal, anxiously waiting thirty minutes for an opportunity to give the second and main signal, during which time I was very sociable. It was rainy and muddy--my pants were rolled up to the knees. I was in the character of a man seeking employment in this country. End of thirty minutes gave the second signal.</p><p>William appeared unmoved; soon sent out the boys; instantly sociable; Peter and Levin at the Island; one of the young masters with them; not safe to undertake to see them till Saturday night, when they would be at home; appointed a place to see Vina, in an open field, that night; they to bring me something to eat; our interview only four minutes; I left; appeared by night; dark and cloudy; at ten o&#39;clock appeared William; exchanged signals; led me a few rods to where stood Vina; gave her the signal sent by Peter; our interview ten minutes; she did not call me &quot;master,&quot; nor did she say &quot;sir,&quot; by which I knew she had confidence in me.</p><p>Our situation being dangerous, we decided that I meet Peter and Levin on the bank of the river early dawn of day, Sunday, to establish the laws. During our interview, William prostrated on his knees, and face to the ground; arms sprawling; head cocked back, watching for wolves, by which position a man can see better in the dark. No house to go to safely, traveled round till morning, eating hoe cake which William had given me for supper; next day going around to get employment. I thought of William, who is a Christian preacher, and of the Christian preachers in Pennsylvania. One watching for wolves by night, to rescue Vina and her three children from Christian licentiousness; the other standing erect in open day, seeking the praise of men.</p><p>During the four days waiting for the important Sunday morning, I thoroughly surveyed the rocks and shoals of the river from Florence seven miles up, where will be my place of departure. General notice was taken of me as being a stranger, lurking around. Fortunately there are several small grist mills within ten miles around. No taverns here, as in the North; any planter&#39;s house entertains travelers occasionally.</p><p>One night I stayed at a medical gentleman&#39;s, who is not a large planter; another night at an ex-magistrate&#39;s house in South Florence--a Virginian by birth--one of the late census takers; told me that many more persons cannot read and write than is reported; one fact, amongst many others, that many persons who do not know the letters of the alphabet, have learned to write their own names; such are generally reported readers and writers.</p><p>It being customary for a stranger not to leave the house early in the morning where he has lodged, I was under the necessity of staying out all night Saturday, to be able to meet Peter and Levin, which was accomplished in due time. When we approached, I gave my signal first; immediately they gave theirs. I talked freely. Levin&#39;s voice, at first, evidently trembled. No wonder, for my presence universally attracted attention by the lords of the land. Our interview was less than one hour; the laws were written. I to go to Cincinnati to get a rowing boat and provisions; a first class clipper boat to go with speed. To depart from the place where the laws were written, on Saturday night of the first of March. I to meet one of them at the same place Thursday night, previous to the fourth Saturday from the night previous to the Sunday when the laws were written. We to go down the Tennessee river to some place up the Ohio, not yet decided on, in our row boat. Peter and Levin are good oarsmen. So am I. Telegraph station at Tuscumbia, twelve miles from the plantation, also at Paducah.</p><p>Came from Florence to here Sunday night by steamboat. Eastport is in Mississippi. Waiting here for a steamboat to go down; paying one dollar a day for board. Like other taverns here, the wretchedness is indescribable; no pen, ink, paper or newspaper to be had; only one room for everybody, except the gambling rooms. It is difficult for me to write. Vina intends to get a pass for Catharine and herself for the first Sunday in March.</p><p>The bank of the river where I met Peter and Levin is two miles from the plantation. I have avoided saying I am from Philadelphia. Also avoided talking about negroes. I never talked so much about milling before. I consider most of the trouble over, till I arrive in a free State with my crew, the first week in March; then will I have to be wiser than Christian serpents, and more cautious than doves. I do not consider it safe to keep this letter in my possession, yet I dare not put it in the post-office here; there is so little business in these post-offices that notice might be taken.</p><p>I am evidently watched; everybody knows me to be a miller. I may write again when I get to Cincinnati, if I should have time. The ex-magistrate, with whom I stayed in South Florence, held three hours&#39; talk with me, exclusive of our morning talk. Is a man of good general information; he was exceedingly inquisitive. &quot;I am from Cincinnati, formerly from the <em>State of New York</em>.&quot; I had no opportunity to get anything to eat from seven o&#39;clock Tuesday morning till six o&#39;clock Wednesday evening, except the hoe cake, and no sleep.</p><p>Florence is the head of navigation for small steamboats. Seven miles, all the way up to my place of departure, is swift water, and rocky. Eight hundred miles to Cincinnati. I found all things here as Peter told me, except the distance of the river. South Florence contains twenty white families, three warehouses of considerable business, a post-office, but no school. McKiernon is here waiting for a steamboat to go to New Orleans, so we are in company.</p><p>PRINCETON, GIBSON COUNTY, INDIANA, FEB. 18, 1851.</p><p>To Wm. Still:--The plan is to go to Canada, on the Wabash, opposite Detroit. There are four routes to Canada. One through Illinois, commencing above and below Alton; one through to North Indiana, and the Cincinnati route, being the largest route in the United States.</p><p>I intended to have gone through Pennsylvania, but the risk going up the Ohio river has caused me to go to Canada. Steamboat traveling is universally condemned, though many go in boats, consequently many get lost. Going in a skiff is new, and is approved of in my case. After I arrive at the mouth of the Tennessee river, I will go up the Ohio seventy-five miles, to the mouth of the Wabash, then up the Wabash, forty-four miles to New Harmony, where I shall go ashore by night, and go thirteen miles east, to Charles Grier, a farmer, (colored man), who will entertain us, and next night convey us sixteen miles to David Stormon, near Princeton, who will take the command, and I be released.</p><p>David Stormon estimates the expenses from his house to Canada, at forty dollars, without which, no sure protection will be given. They might be instructed concerning the course, and beg their way through without money. If you wish to do what should be done, you will send me fifty dollars, in a letter, to Princeton, Gibson county, Inda., so as to arrive there by the 8th of March. Eight days should be estimated for a letter to arrive from Philadelphia.</p><p>The money to be State Bank of Ohio, or State Bank, or Northern Bank of Kentucky, or any other Eastern bank. Send no notes larger than twenty dollars.</p><p>Levi Coffin had no money for me. I paid twenty dollars for the skiff. No money to get back to Philadelphia. It was not understood that I would have to be at any expense seeking aid.</p><p>One half of my time has been used in trying to find persons to assist, when I may arrive on the Ohio river, in which I have failed, except Stormon.</p><p>Having no letter of introduction to Stormon from any source, on which I could fully rely, I traveled two hundred miles around, to find out his stability. I have found many Abolitionists, nearly all who have made propositions, which themselves would not comply with, and nobody else would. Already I have traveled over three thousand miles. Two thousand and four hundred by steamboat, two hundred by railroad, one hundred by stage, four hundred on foot, forty-eight in a skiff.</p><p>I have yet five hundred miles to go to the plantation, to commence operations. I have been two weeks on the decks of steamboats, three nights out, two of which I got perfectly wet. If I had had paper money, as McKim desired, it would have been destroyed. I have not been entertained gratis at any place except Stormon&#39;s. I had one hundred and twenty-six dollars when I left Philadelphia, one hundred from you, twenty-six mine.</p><p>Telegraphed to station at Evansville, thirty-three miles from Stormon&#39;s, and at Vinclure&#39;s, twenty-five miles from Stormon&#39;s. The Wabash route is considered the safest route. No one has ever been lost from Stormon&#39;s to Canada. Some have been lost between Stormon&#39;s and the Ohio. The wolves have never suspected Stormon. Your asking aid in money for a case properly belonging east of Ohio, is detested. If you have sent money to Cincinnati, you should recall it. I will have no opportunity to use it.</p><p>Seth Concklin, Princeton, Gibson county, Ind.</p><p>P.S. First of April, will be about the time Peter&#39;s family will arrive opposite Detroit. You should inform yourself how to find them there. I may have no opportunity.</p><p>I will look promptly for your letter at Princeton, till the 10th of March, and longer if there should have been any delay by the mails.</p><p>In March, as contemplated, Concklin arrived in Indiana, at the place designated, with Peter&#39;s wife and three children, and sent a thrilling letter to the writer, portraying in the most vivid light his adventurous flight from the hour they left Alabama until their arrival in Indiana. In this report he stated, that instead of starting early in the morning, owing to some unforeseen delay on the part of the family, they did not reach the designated place till towards day, which greatly exposed them in passing a certain town which he had hoped to avoid.</p><p>But as his brave heart was bent on prosecuting his journey without further delay, he concluded to start at all hazards, notwithstanding the dangers he apprehended from passing said town by daylight. For safety he endeavored to hide his freight by having them all lie flat down on the bottom of the skiff; covered them with blankets, concealing them from the effulgent beams of the early morning sun, or rather from the &quot;Christian Wolves&quot; who might perchance espy him from the shore in passing the town.</p><p>The wind blew fearfully. Concklin was rowing heroically when loud voices from the shore hailed him, but he was utterly deaf to the sound. Immediately one or two guns were fired in the direction of the skiff, but he heeded not this significant call; consequently here ended this difficulty. He supposed, as the wind was blowing so hard, those on shore who hailed him must have concluded that he did not hear them and that he meant no disrespect in treating them with seeming indifference. Whilst many straits and great dangers had to be passed, this was the greatest before reaching their destination.</p><p>But suffice it to say that the glad tidings which this letter contained filled the breast of Peter with unutterable delight and his friends and relations with wonder beyond degree.[A] No fond wife had ever waited with more longing desire for the return of her husband than Peter had for this blessed news. All doubts had disappeared, and a well grounded hope was cherished that within a few short days Peter and his fond wife and children would be reunited in Freedom on the Canada side, and that Concklin and the friends would be rejoicing with joy unspeakable over this great triumph. But alas, before the few days had expired the subjoined brief paragraph of news was discovered in the morning Ledger.</p><p>[Footnote A: In some unaccountable manner this the last letter Concklin ever penned, perhaps, has been unfortunately lost.]</p><pre><code>RUNAWAY NEGROES CAUGHT.--At Vincennes, Indiana, on Saturday

And it may safely be said from a truer and more devoted friend of the slave they could not have received counsel.</p><pre><code>EVANSVILLE, INDIANA, MARCH 31st, 1851.

WM. STILL: _Dear Sir_ ,--On last Tuesday I mailed a letter to
you, written by Seth Concklin. I presume you have received that
letter. It gave an account of his rescue of the family of your
brother. If that is the last news you have had from them, I have
very painful intelligence for you. They passed on from near
Princeton, where I saw them and had a lengthy interview with
them, up north, I think twenty-three miles above Vincennes,
Ind., where they were seized by a party of men, and lodged in
jail. Telegraphic dispatches were sent all through the South. I
have since learned that the Marshall of Evansville received a
dispatch from Tuscumbia, to look out for them. By some means, he
and the master, so says report, went to Vincennes and claimed
the fugitives, chained Mr. Concklin and hurried all off. Mr.
Concklin wrote to Mr. David Stormon, Princeton, as soon as he
was cast into prison, to find bail. So soon as we got the letter
and could get off, two of us were about setting off to render
all possible aid, when we were told they all had passed, a few
hours before, through Princeton, Mr. Concklin in chains. What
kind of process was had, if any, I know not. I immediately came
down to this place, and learned that they had been put on a boat
at 3 P.M. I did not arrive until 6. Now all hopes of their
recovery are gone. No case ever so enlisted my sympathies. I had
seen Mr. Concklin in Cincinnati. I had given him aid and
counsel. I happened to see them after they landed in Indiana. I
heard Peter and Levin tell their tale of suffering, shed tears
of sorrow for them all; but now, since they have fallen a prey
to the unmerciful blood-hounds of this state, and have again
been dragged back to unrelenting bondage, I am entirely
unmanned. And poor Concklin! I fear for him. When he is dragged
back to Alabama, I fear they will go far beyond the utmost rigor
of the law, and vent their savage cruelty upon him. It is with
pain I have to communicate these things. But you may not hear
them from him. I could not get to see him or them, as Vincennes
is about thirty miles from Princeton, where I was when I heard
of the capture.

I take pleasure in stating that, according to the letter he
(Concklin) wrote to Mr. D. Stewart, Mr. Concklin did not abandon
them, but risked his own liberty to save them. He was not with
them when they were taken; but went afterwards to take them out
of jail upon a writ of Habeas Corpus, when they seized him too
and lodged him in prison.

I write in much haste. If I can learn any more facts of
importance, I may write you. If you desire to hear from me
again, or if you should learn any thing specific from Mr.
Concklin, be pleased to write me at Cincinnati, where I expect
to be in a short time. If curious to know your correspondent, I
may say I was formerly Editor of the &quot;New Concord Free Press,&quot;
Ohio. I only add that every case of this kind only tends to make
me abhor my (no!) _this_ country more and more. It is the
Devil&#39;s Government, and God will destroy it.

Yours for the slave, N.R. JOHNSTON.

P.S. I broke open this letter to write you some more. The
foregoing pages were written at night. I expected to mail it
next morning before leaving Evansville; but the boat for which I
was waiting came down about three in the morning; so I had to
hurry on board, bringing the letter along. As it now is I am not
sorry, for coming down, on my way to St. Louis, as far as
Paducah, there I learned from a colored man at the wharf that,
that same day, in the morning, the master and the family of
fugitives arrived off the boat, and had then gone on their
journey to Tuscumbia, but that the &quot;white man&quot; (Mr. Concklin)
had &quot;got away from them,&quot; about twelve miles up the river. It
seems he got off the boat some way, near or at Smithland, Ky., a
town at the mouth of the Cumberland River. I presume the report
is true, and hope he will finally escape, though I was also told
that they were in pursuit of him. Would that the others had also
escaped. Peter and Levin could have done so, I think, if they
had had resolution. One of them rode a horse, he not tied
either, behind the coach in which the others were. He followed
apparently &quot;contented and happy.&quot; From report, they told their
master, and even their pursuers, before the master came, that
Concklin had decoyed them away, they coming unwillingly. I write
on a very unsteady boat.

Yours, N.R. JOHNSTON.
</code></pre><p>A report found its way into the papers to the effect that &quot;Miller,&quot; the white man arrested in connection with the capture of the family, was found drowned, with his hands and feet in chains and his skull fractured. It proved, as his friends feared, to be Seth Concklin. And in irons, upon the river bank, there is no doubt he was buried.</p><p>In this dreadful hour one sad duty still remained to be performed. Up to this moment the two sisters were totally ignorant of their brother&#39;s whereabouts. Not the first whisper of his death had reached them. But they must now be made acquainted with all the facts in the case. Accordingly an interview was arranged for a meeting, and the duty of conveying this painful intelligence to one of the sisters, Mrs. Supplee, devolved upon Mr. McKim. And most tenderly and considerately did he perform his mournful task.</p><p>Although a woman of nerve, and a true friend to the slave, an earnest worker and a liberal giver in the Female Anti-Slavery Society, for a time she was overwhelmed by the intelligence of her brother&#39;s death. As soon as possible, however, through very great effort, she controlled her emotions, and calmly expressed herself as being fully resigned to the awful event. Not a word of complaint had she to make because she had not been apprised of his movements; but said repeatedly, that, had she known ever so much of his intentions, she would have been totally powerless in opposing him if she had felt so disposed, and as an illustration of the true character of the man, from his boyhood up to the day he died for his fellow-man, she related his eventful career, and recalled a number of instances of his heroic and daring deeds for others, sacrificing his time and often periling his life in the cause of those who he considered were suffering gross wrongs and oppression. Hence, she concluded, that it was only natural for him in this case to have taken the steps he did. Now and then overflowing tears would obstruct this deeply thrilling and most remarkable story she was telling of her brother, but her memory seemed quickened by the sadness of the occasion, and she was enabled to recall vividly the chief events connected with his past history. Thus his agency in this movement, which cost him his life, could readily enough be accounted for, and the individuals who listened attentively to the story were prepared to fully appreciate his character, for, prior to offering his services in this mission, he had been a stranger to them.</p><p>The following extract, taken from a letter of a subsequent date, in addition to the above letter, throws still further light upon the heart-rending affair, and shows Mr. Johnston&#39;s deep sympathy with the sufferers and the oppressed generally--</p><p>EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM REV. N.R. JOHNSTON.</p><pre><code>My heart bleeds when I think of those poor, hunted and
heart-broken fugitives, though a most interesting family, taken
back to bondage ten-fold worse than Egyptian. And then poor
Concklin! How my heart expanded in love to him, as he told me
his adventures, his trials, his toils, his fears and his hopes!
After hearing all, and then seeing and communing with the
family, now joyful in hopes of soon seeing their husband and
father in the land of freedom; now in terror lest the human
blood-hounds should be at their heels, I felt as though I could
lay down my life in the cause of the oppressed. In that hour or
two of intercourse with Peter&#39;s family, my heart warmed with
love to them. I never saw more interesting young men. They would
make Remonds or Douglasses, if they had the same opportunities.

While I was with them, I was elated with joy at their escape,
and yet, when I heard their tale of woe, especially that of the
mother, I could not suppress tears of deepest emotion.

My joy was short-lived. Soon I heard of their capture. The
telegraph had been the means of their being claimed. I could
have torn down all the telegraph wires in the land. It was a
strange dispensation of Providence.

On Saturday the sad news of their capture came to my ears. We
had resolved to go to their aid on Monday, as the trial was set
for Thursday. On Sabbath, I spoke from Psalm xii. 5. &quot;For the
oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I
arise,&quot; saith the Lord: &quot;I will set him in safety from him that
puffeth at (from them that would enslave) him.&quot; When on Monday
morning I learned that the fugitives had passed through the
place on Sabbath, and Concklin in chains, probably at the very
time I was speaking on the subject referred to, my heart sank
within me. And even yet, I cannot but exclaim, when I think of
it--O, Father! how long ere Thou wilt arise to avenge the wrongs
of the poor slave! Indeed, my dear brother, His ways are very
mysterious. We have the consolation, however, to know that all
is for the best. Our Redeemer does all things well. When He hung
upon the cross, His poor broken hearted disciples could not
understand the providence; it was a dark time to them; and yet
that was an event that was fraught with more joy to the world
than any that has occurred or could occur. Let us stand at our
post and wait God&#39;s time. Let us have on the whole armor of God,
and fight for the right, knowing, that though we may fall in
battle, the victory will be ours, sooner or later.


       *       *       *       *       *


May God lead you into all truth, and sustain you in your labors,
and fulfill your prayers and hopes. Adieu.

N.R. JOHNSTON.

FRIEND WM. STILL:--We have sorrowful news from our friend
Concklin, through the papers and otherwise. I received a letter
a few days ago from a friend near Princeton, Ind., stating that
Concklin and the four slaves are in prison in Vincennes, and
that their trial would come on in a few days. He states that
they rowed seven days and nights in the skiff, and got safe to
Harmony, Ind., on the Wabash river, thence to Princeton, and
were conveyed to Vincennes by friends, where they were taken.
The papers state, that they were all given up to the Marshal of
Evansville, Indiana.

We have telegraphed to different points, to try to get some
information concerning them, but failed. The last information is
published in the _Times_ of yesterday, though quite incorrect in
the particulars of the case. Inclosed is the slip containing it.
I fear all is over in regard to the freedom of the slaves. If
the last account be true, we have some hope that Concklin will
escape from those bloody tyrants. I cannot describe my feelings
on hearing this sad intelligence. I feel ashamed to own my
country. Oh! what shall I say. Surely a God of justice will
avenge the wrongs of the oppressed.

Thine for the poor slave,

LEVI COFFIN.

N.B.--If thou hast any information, please write me forthwith.





CINCINNATI, 5TH MO., 11TH, 1851.

WM. STILL:--_Dear Friend_--Thy letter of 1st inst., came duly to
hand, but not being able to give any further information
concerning our friend, Concklin, I thought best to wait a little
before I wrote, still hoping to learn something more definite
concerning him.

We that became acquainted with Seth Concklin and his hazardous
enterprises (here at Cincinnati), who were very few, have felt
intense and inexpressible anxiety about them. And particularly
about poor Seth, since we heard of his falling into the hands of
the tyrants. I fear that he has fallen a victim to their inhuman
thirst for blood.

I seriously doubt the rumor, that he had made his escape. I fear
that he was sacrificed.

Language would fail to express my feelings; the intense and deep
anxiety I felt about them for weeks before I heard of their
capture in Indiana, and then it seemed too much to bear. O! my
heart almost bleeds when I think of it. The hopes of the dear
family all blasted by the wretched blood-hounds in human shape.
And poor Seth, after all his toil, and dangerous, shrewd and
wise management, and almost unheard of adventures, the many
narrow and almost miraculous escapes. Then to be given up to
Indianians, to these fiendish tyrants, to be sacrificed. O!
Shame, Shame!!

My heart aches, my eyes fill with tears, I cannot write more. I
cannot dwell longer on this painful subject now. If you get any
intelligence, please inform me. Friend N.R. Johnston, who took
so much interest in them, and saw them just before they were
taken, has just returned to the city. He is a minister of the
Covenanter order. He is truly a lovely man, and his heart is
full of the milk of humanity; one of our best Anti-Slavery
spirits. I spent last evening with him. He related the whole
story to me as he had it from friend Concklin and the mother and
children, and then the story of their capture. We wept together.
He found thy letter when he got here.

He said he would write the whole history to thee in a few days,
as far as he could. He can tell it much better than I can.

Concklin left his carpet sack and clothes here with me, except a
shirt or two he took with him. What shall I do with them? For if
we do not hear from him soon, we must conclude that he is lost,
and the report of his escape all a hoax.

Truly thy friend,

LEVI COFFIN.

But most formidable difficulties stood in the way of opening correspondence with reliable persons in Alabama. Indeed it seemed impossible to find a merchant, lawyer, doctor, planter or minister, who was not too completely interlinked with slavery to be relied upon to manage a negotiation of this nature.

B McKIERNON
</code></pre><p>WM. STILL&#39;S ANSWER.</p><pre><code>PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 16th, 1851.

To B. McKIERNON, ESQ.: _Sir_--I have received your letter from
South Florence, Ala., under date of the 6th inst. To say that it
took me by surprise, as well as afforded me pleasure, for which
I feel to be very much indebted to you, is no more than true. In
regard to your informants of myself--Mr. Thornton, of Ala., and
Mr. Samuel Lewis, of Cincinnati--to them both I am a stranger.
However, I am the brother of Peter, referred to, and with the
fact of his having a wife and three children in your service I
am also familiar. This brother, Peter, I have only had the
pleasure of knowing for the brief space of one year and thirteen
days, although he is now past forty and I twenty-nine years of
age. Time will not allow me at present, or I should give you a
detailed account of how Peter became a slave, the forty long
years which intervened between the time he was kidnapped, when a
boy, being only six years of age, and his arrival in this city,
from Alabama, one year and fourteen days ago, when he was
re-united to his mother, five brothers and three sisters.

None but a father&#39;s heart can fathom the anguish and sorrows
felt by Peter during the many vicissitudes through which he has
passed. He looked back to his boyhood and saw himself snatched
from the tender embraces of his parents and home to be made a
slave for life.

During all his prime days he was in the faithful and constant
service of those who had no just claim upon him. In the
meanwhile he married a wife, who bore him eleven children, the
greater part of whom were emancipated from the troubles of life
by death, and three only survived. To them and his wife he was
devoted. Indeed I have never seen attachment between parents and
children, or husband and wife, more entire than was manifested
in the case of Peter.

Through these many years of servitude, Peter was sold and
resold, from one State to another, from one owner to another,
till he reached the forty-ninth year of his age, when, in a good
Providence, through the kindness of a friend and the sweat of
his brow, he regained the God-given blessings of liberty. He
eagerly sought his parents and home with all possible speed and
pains, when, to his heart&#39;s joy, he found his relatives.

Your present humble correspondent is the youngest of Peter&#39;s
brothers, and the first one of the family he saw after arriving
in this part of the country. I think you could not fail to be
interested in hearing how we became known to each other, and the
proof of our being brothers, etc., all of which I should be most
glad to relate, but time will not permit me to do so. The news
of this wonderful occurrence, of Peter finding his kindred, was
published quite extensively, shortly afterwards, in various
newspapers, in this quarter, which may account for the fact of
&quot;Miller&#39;s&quot; knowledge of the whereabouts of the &quot;fugitives.&quot; Let
me say, it is my firm conviction that no one had any hand in
persuading &quot;Miller&quot; to go down from Cincinnati, or any other
place, after the family. As glad as I should be, and as much as
I would do for the liberation of Peter&#39;s family (now no longer
young), and his three &quot;likely&quot; children, in whom he prides
himself--how much, if you are a father, you can imagine; yet I
would not, and could not, think of persuading any friend to
peril his life, as would be the case, in an errand of that kind.

As regards the price fixed upon by you for the family, I must
say I do not think it possible to raise half that amount, though
Peter authorized me to say he would give you twenty-five hundred
for them. Probably he is not as well aware as I am, how
difficult it is to raise so large a sum of money from the
public. The applications for such objects are so frequent among
us in the North, and have always been so liberally met, that it
is no wonder if many get tired of being called upon. To be sure
some of us brothers own some property, but no great amount;
certainly not enough to enable us to bear so great a burden.
Mother owns a small farm in New Jersey, on which she has lived
for nearly forty years, from which she derives her support in
her old age. This small farm contains between forty and fifty
acres, and is the fruit of my father&#39;s toil. Two of my brothers
own small places also, but they have young families, and
consequently consume nearly as much as they make, with the
exception of adding some improvements to their places.

For my own part, I am employed as a clerk for a living, but my
salary is quite too limited to enable me to contribute any great
amount towards so large a sum as is demanded. Thus you see how
we are situated financially. We have plenty of friends, but
little money. Now, sir, allow me to make an appeal to your
humanity, although we are aware of your power to hold as
property those poor slaves, mother, daughter and two sons,--that
in no part of the United States could they escape and be secure
from your claim--nevertheless, would your understanding, your
heart, or your conscience reprove you, should you restore to
them, without price, that dear freedom, which is theirs by right
of nature, or would you not feel a satisfaction in so doing
which all the wealth of the world could not equal? At all
events, could you not so reduce the price as to place it in the
power of Peter&#39;s relatives and friends to raise the means for
their purchase? At first, I doubt not, but that you will think
my appeal very unreasonable; but, sir, serious reflection will
decide, whether the money demanded by you, after all, will be of
as great a benefit to you, as the satisfaction you would find in
bestowing so great a favor upon those whose entire happiness in
this life depends mainly upon your decision in the matter. If
the entire family cannot be purchased or freed, what can Vina
and her daughter be purchased for? Hoping, sir, to hear from

To B. McKiernon, Esq.
</code></pre><p>No reply to this letter was ever received from McKiernon. The cause of his reticence can be as well conjectured by the reader as the writer.</p><p>Time will not admit of further details kindred to this narrative. The life, struggles, and success of Peter and his family were ably brought before the public in the &quot;Kidnapped and the Ransomed,&quot; being the personal recollections of Peter Still and his wife &quot;Vina,&quot; after forty years of slavery, by Mrs. Kate E.R. Pickard; with an introduction by Rev. Samuel J. May, and an appendix by William H. Furness, D.D., in 1856. But, of course it was not prudent or safe, in the days of Slavery, to publish such facts as are now brought to light; all such had to be kept concealed in the breasts of the fugitives and their friends.</p><p>[Illustration: PETER STILL ]</p><p>[Illustration: CHARITY STILL ]</p><p>The following brief sketch, touching the separation of Peter and his mother, will fitly illustrate this point, and at the same time explain certain mysteries which have been hitherto kept hidden--</p><p>THE SEPARATION.</p><p>With regard to Peter&#39;s separation from his mother, when a little boy, in few words, the facts were these: His parents, Levin and Sidney, were both slaves on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. &quot;I will die before I submit to the yoke,&quot; was the declaration of his father to his young master before either was twenty-one years of age. Consequently he was allowed to buy himself at a very low figure, and he paid the required sum and obtained his &quot;free papers&quot; when quite a young man--the young wife and mother remaining in slavery under Saunders Griffin, as also her children, the latter having increased to the number of four, two little boys and two little girls. But to escape from chains, stripes, and bondage, she took her four little children and fled to a place near Greenwich, New Jersey. Not a great while, however, did she remain there in a state of freedom before the slave-hunters pursued her, and one night they pounced upon the whole family, and, without judge or jury, hurried them all back to slavery. Whether this was kidnapping or not is for the reader to decide for himself.</p><p>Safe back in the hands of her owner, to prevent her from escaping a second time, every night for about three months she was cautiously &quot;kept locked up in the garret,&quot; until, as they supposed, she was fully &quot;cured of the desire to do so again.&quot; But she was incurable. She had been a witness to the fact that her own father&#39;s brains had been blown out by the discharge of a heavily loaded gun, deliberately aimed at his head by his drunken master. She only needed half a chance to make still greater struggles than ever for freedom.</p><p>She had great faith in God, and found much solace in singing some of the good old Methodist tunes, by day and night. Her owner, observing this apparently tranquil state of mind, indicating that she &quot;seemed better contented than ever,&quot; concluded that it was safe to let the garret door remain unlocked at night. Not many weeks were allowed to pass before she resolved to again make a bold strike for freedom. This time she had to leave the two little boys, Levin and Peter, behind.</p><p>On the night she started she went to the bed where they were sleeping, kissed them, and, consigning them into the hands of God, bade her mother good-bye, and with her two little girls wended her way again to Burlington County, New Jersey, but to a different neighborhood from that where she had been seized. She changed her name to Charity, and succeeded in again joining her husband, but, alas, with the heart-breaking thought that she had been compelled to leave her two little boys in slavery and one of the little girls on the road for the father to go back after. Thus she began life in freedom anew.</p><p>Levin and Peter, eight and six years of age respectively, were now left at the mercy of the enraged owner, and were soon hurried off to a Southern market and sold, while their mother, for whom they were daily weeping, was they knew not where. They were too young to know that they were slaves, or to understand the nature of the afflicting separation. Sixteen years before Peter&#39;s return, his older brother (Levin) died a slave in the State of Alabama, and was buried by his surviving brother, Peter.</p><p>No idea other than that they had been &quot;kidnapped&quot; from their mother ever entered their minds; nor had they any knowledge of the State from whence they supposed they had been taken, the last names of their mother and father, or where they were born. On the other hand, the mother was aware that the safety of herself and her rescued children depended on keeping the whole transaction a strict family secret. During the forty years of separation, except two or three Quaker friends, including the devoted friend of the slave, Benjamin Lundy, it is doubtful whether any other individuals were let into the secret of her slave life. And when the account given of Peter&#39;s return, etc., was published in 1850, it led some of the family to apprehend serious danger from the partial revelation of the early condition of the mother, especially as it was about the time that the Fugitive Slave law was passed.</p><p>Hence, the author of &quot;The Kidnapped and the Ransomed&quot; was compelled to omit these dangerous facts, and had to confine herself strictly to the &quot;personal recollections of Peter Still&quot; with regard to his being &quot;kidnapped.&quot; Likewise, in the sketch of Seth Concklin&#39;s eventful life, written by Dr. W.H. Furness, for similar reasons he felt obliged to make but bare reference to his wonderful agency in relation to Peter&#39;s family, although he was fully aware of all the facts in the case.</p><p>UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD LETTERS.</p><p>Here are introduced a few out of a very large number of interesting letters, designed for other parts of the book as occasion may require. All letters will be given precisely as they were written by their respective authors, so that there may be no apparent room for charging the writer with partial colorings in any instance.

DEPOT).</p><p>WILMINGTON, 3mo. 23d, 1856.</p><p>DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Since I wrote thee this morning informing thee of the safe arrival of the Eight from Norfolk, Harry Craige has informed me, that he has a man from Delaware that he proposes to take along, who arrived since noon. He will take the man, woman and two children from here with him, and the four men will get in at Marcus Hook. Thee may take Harry Craige by the hand as a brother, true to the cause; he is one of our most efficient aids on the Rail Road, and worthy of full confidence. May they all be favored to get on safe. The woman and three children are no common stock. I assure thee finer specimens of humanity are seldom met with. I hope herself and children may be enabled to find her husband, who has been absent some years, and the rest of their days be happy together.</p><p>I am, as ever, thy friend,</p><p>THOS. GARRETT.</p><p>LETTER FROM MISS G.A. LEWIS (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).</p><p>KIMBERTON, October 28th, 1855.</p><p>ESTEEMED FRIEND;--This evening a company of eleven friends reached here, having left their homes on the night of the 26th inst. They came into Wilmington, about ten o&#39;clock on the morning of the 27th, and left there, in the town, their two carriages, drawn by two horses. They went to Thomas Garrett&#39;s by open day-light and from thence were sent hastily onward for fear of pursuit. They reached Longwood meeting-house in the evening, at which place a Fair Circle had convened, and stayed a while in the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one of the Kennet friends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the morning, and from thence, by daylight, to within a short distance of this place.</p><p>They come from New Chestertown, within five miles of the place from which the nine lately forwarded came, and left behind them a colored woman who knew of their intended flight and of their intention of passing through Wilmington and leaving their horses and carriages there.</p><p>I have been thus particular in my statement, because the case seems to us one of unusual danger. We have separated the company for the present, sending a mother and five children, two of them quite small, in one direction, and a husband and wife and three lads in another, until I could write to you and get advice if you have any to give, as to the best method of forwarding them, and assistance pecuniarily, in getting them to Canada. The mother and children we have sent off of the usual route, and to a place where I do not think they can remain many days.</p><p>We shall await hearing from you. H. Kimber will be in the city on third day, the 30th, and any thing left at 408 Green Street directed to his care, will meet with prompt attention.</p><p>Please give me again the direction of Hiram Wilson and the friend in Elmira, Mr. Jones, I think. If you have heard from any of the nine since their safe arrival, please let us know when you write.</p><p>Very Respectfully,</p><p>G.A. LEWIS.</p><p><em>2d day morning, 29th</em>.--The person who took the husband and wife and three lads to E.F. Pennypecker, and Peart, has returned and reports that L. Peart sent three on to Norristown. We fear that there they will fall into the hands of an ignorant colored man Daniel Ross, and that he may not understand the necessity of caution. Will you please write to some careful person there? The woman and children detained in this neighborhood are a very helpless set. Our plan was to assist them as much as possible, and when we get things into the proper train for sending them on, to get the assistance of the husband and wife, who have no children, but are uncle and aunt to the woman with five, in taking with them one of the younger children, leaving fewer for the mother. Of the lads, or young men, there is also one whom we thought capable of accompanying one of the older girls--one to whom he is paying attention, they told us. Would it not be the best way to get those in Norristown under your own care? It seems to me their being sent on could then be better arranged. This, however, is only a suggestion,</p><p>Hastily yours,</p><p>G.A. LEWIS.</p><p>LETTER FROM E.L. STEVENS, ESQ. <em>(The reader will interpret for himself</em>.)</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C., July 11th, 1858.</p><p>MY DEAR SIR:--Susan Bell left here yesterday with the child of her relative, and since leaving I have thought, perhaps, you had not the address of the gentleman in Syracuse where the child is to be taken for medical treatment, etc. His name is Dr. H.B. Wilbur. A woman living with him is a most excellent nurse and will take a deep interest in the child, which, no doubt, will under Providence be the means of its complete restoration to health. Be kind enough to inform me whether Susan is with you, and if she is give her the proper direction. <em>Ten packages</em> were sent to your address last evening, one of them belongs to Susan, and she had better remain with you till she gets it, as it may not have come to hand. Susan thought she would go to Harrisburg when she left here and stay over Sunday, if so, she would not get to Philadelphia till Monday or Tuesday. Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and inform me of her arrival, also when the packages came safe to hand, inform me especially if Susan&#39;s came safely.</p><p>Truly Yours,</p><p>E.L. STEVENS.</p><p>LETTER FROM S.H. GAY, ESQ., EX-EDITOR OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD AND NEW YORK TRIBUNE.</p><p>FRIEND STILL:--The two women, Laura and Lizzy, arrived this morning. I shall forward them to Syracuse this afternoon.</p><p>The two men came safely yesterday, but went to Gibbs&#39;. He has friends on board the boat who are on the lookout for fugitives, and send them, when found, to his house. Those whom you wish to be particularly under my charge, must have careful directions to this office.</p><p>There is now no other sure place, but the office, or Gibbs&#39;, that I could advise you to send such persons. Those to me, therefore, must come in office hours. In a few days, however, Napoleon will have a room down town, and at odd times they can be sent there. I am not willing to put any more with the family where I have hitherto sometimes sent them.</p><p>When it is possible I wish you would advise me two days before a shipment of your intention, as Napoleon is not always on hand to look out for them at short notice. In special cases you might advise me by Telegraph, thus: &quot;One M. (or one F.) this morning. W.S.&quot; By which I shall understand that one Male, or one Female, as the case may be, has left Phila. by the 6 <em>o&#39;clock train</em>--one or more, also, as the case may be.</p><p>Aug. 17th, 1855.</p><p>Truly Yours, S.H.

HILL, A FUGITIVE, APPEALING IN BEHALF OF A POOR SLAVE IN PETERSBURG, VA.</p><p>HAMILTON, Sept. 15th, 1856.</p><p>DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I write to inform you that Miss Mary Wever arrived safe in this city. You may imagine the happiness manifested on the part of the two lovers, Mr. H. and Miss W. I think they will be married as soon as they can get ready. I presume Mrs. Hill will commence to make up the articles to-morrow. Kind Sir, as all of us is concerned about the welfare of our enslaved brethren at the South, particularly our friends, we appeal to your sympathy to do whatever is in your power to save poor Willis Johnson from the hands of his cruel master. It is not for me to tell you of his case, because Miss Wever has related the matter fully to you. All I wish to say is this, I wish you to write to my uncle, at Petersburg, by our friend, the Capt. Tell my uncle to go to Richmond and ask my mother whereabouts this man is. The best for him is to make his way to Petersburg; that is, if you can get the Capt. to bring him. He have not much money. But I hope the friends of humanity will not withhold their aid on the account of money. However we will raise all the money that is wanting to pay for his safe delivery. You will please communicate this to the friends as soon as possible.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>JOHN H. HILL.</p><p>LETTER FROM J. BIGELOW, ESQ.</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C., June 22d, 1854.</p><p>MR.

Penn, lately wrote to Mr. Wright, saying he would pay $300 to have this service performed.

I understand that the <em>three</em> are to be brought to this city and stored in safety, as soon as the forwarding merchant in Philadelphia shall say he is ready to send on. The storage, etc., here, will cost a trifle, but the $300 will be promptly paid for the whole service. I think Mr. Wright&#39;s daughter, Hannah, has also seen you. I am also known to Prof. C.D.

I have done the best I could for their comfort, but they are about to proceed across the lake to Toronto, thinking they can do better there than here, which is not unlikely. They all remember you as their friend and benefactor, and return to you their sincere thanks.

WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Friend and Brother_--A thousand thanks for
your good, generous letter!

It was so kind of you to have in mind my intense interest and
anxiety in the success and fate of poor Concklin! That he
desired and intended to hazard an attempt of the kind, I well
understood; but what particular one, or that he had actually
embarked in the enterprise, I had not been able to learn.

His memory will ever be among the sacredly cherished with me. He
certainly displayed more real disinterestedness, more earnest,
unassuming devotedness, than those who _claim_ to be the
sincerest friends of the slave can often boast. What more
_Saviour_-like than the _willing_ sacrifice he has rendered!

Never shall I forget that night of our extremest peril (as we
supposed), when he came and so heartily proffered his services
at the hazard of his liberty, of life even, in behalf of William
L. Chaplin.

_Such_ generosity! at _such_ a moment! The emotions it awakened
no words can bespeak! They are to be sought but in the inner
chambers of one&#39;s own soul! He as earnestly devised the means,
as calmly counted the cost, and as unshrinkingly turned him to
the task, as if it were his own freedom he would have won.

Through his homely features, and humble garb, the intrepidity of
soul came out in all its lustre! Heroism, in its native majesty,
_commanded_ one&#39;s admiration and love!

Most truly can I enter into your sorrows, and painfully
appreciate the pang of disappointment which must have followed
this sad intelligence. But so inadequate are words to the
consoling of such griefs, it were almost cruel to attempt to
syllable one&#39;s sympathies.

I cannot bear to believe, that Concklin has been actually
murdered, and yet I hardly dare hope it is otherwise.

And the poor slaves, for whom he periled so much, into what
depths of hopelessness and woe are they again plunged! But the
deeper and blacker for the loss of their dearly sought and
new-found freedom. How long must wrongs like these go
unredressed? &quot;_How long, O God, how long_?&quot;

Very truly yours,

THEODOCIA GILBERT.
</code></pre><p>WILLIAM PEEL, ALIAS WILLIAM BOX PEEL JONES.</p><p>ARRIVED PER ERRICSON LINE OF STEAMERS, WRAPPED IN STRAW AND BOXED UP,</p><p>APRIL, 1859.</p><p>William is twenty-five years of age, unmistakably colored, good-looking, rather under the medium size, and of pleasing manners. William had himself boxed up by a near relative and forwarded by the Erricson line of steamers. He gave the slip to Robert H. Carr, his owner (a grocer and commission merchant), after this wise, and for the following reasons: For some time previous his master had been selling off his slaves every now and then, the same as other groceries, and this admonished William that he was liable to be in the market any day; consequently, he preferred the box to the auction-block.</p><p>He did not complain of having been treated very badly by Carr, but felt that no man was safe while owned by another. In fact, he &quot;hated the very name of slaveholder.&quot; The limit of the box not admitting of straightening himself out he was taken with the cramp on the road, suffered indescribable misery, and had his faith taxed to the utmost,--indeed was brought to the very verge of &quot;screaming aloud&quot; ere relief came. However, he controlled himself, though only for a short season, for before a great while an excessive faintness came over him. Here nature became quite exhausted. He thought he must &quot;die;&quot; but his time had not yet come. After a severe struggle he revived, but only to encounter a third ordeal no less painful than the one through which he had just passed. Next a very &quot;cold chill&quot; came over him, which seemed almost to freeze the very blood in his veins and gave him intense agony, from which he only found relief on awaking, having actually fallen asleep in that condition. Finally, however, he arrived at Philadelphia, on a steamer, Sabbath morning. A devoted friend of his, expecting him, engaged a carriage and repaired to the wharf for the box. The bill of lading and the receipt he had with him, and likewise knew where the box was located on the boat. Although he well knew freight was not usually delivered on Sunday, yet his deep solicitude for the safety of his friend determined him to do all that lay in his power to rescue him from his perilous situation. Handing his bill of lading to the proper officer of the boat, he asked if he could get the freight that it called for. The officer looked at the bill and said, &quot;No, we do not deliver freight on Sunday;&quot; but, noticing the anxiety of the man, he asked him if he would know it if he were to see it. Slowly--fearing that too much interest manifested might excite suspicion--he replied: &quot;I think I should.&quot; Deliberately looking around amongst all the &quot;freight,&quot; he discovered the box, and said, &quot;I think that is it there.&quot; Said officer stepped to it, looked at the directions on it, then at the bill of lading, and said, &quot;That is right, take it along.&quot; Here the interest in these two bosoms was thrilling in the highest degree. But the size of the box was too large for the carriage, and the driver refused to take it. Nearly an hour and a half was spent in looking for a furniture car. Finally one was procured, and again the box was laid hold of by the occupant&#39;s particular friend, when, to his dread alarm, the poor fellow within gave a sudden cough. At this startling circumstance he dropped the box; equally as quick, although dreadfully frightened, and, as if helped by some invisible agency, he commenced singing, &quot;Hush, my babe, lie still and slumber,&quot; with the most apparent indifference, at the same time slowly making his way from the box. Soon his fears subsided, and it was presumed that no one was any the wiser on account of the accident, or coughing. Thus, after summoning courage, he laid hold of the box a third time, and the Rubicon was passed. The car driver, totally ignorant of the contents of the box, drove to the number to which he was directed to take it--left it and went about his business. Now is a moment of intense interest--now of inexpressible delight. The box is opened, the straw removed, and the poor fellow is loosed; and is rejoicing, I will venture to say, as mortal never did rejoice, who had not been in similar peril. This particular friend was scarcely less overjoyed, however, and their joy did not abate for several hours; nor was it confined to themselves, for two invited members of the Vigilance Committee also partook of a full share. This box man was named Wm. Jones. He was boxed up in Baltimore by the friend who received him at the wharf, who did not come in the boat with him, but came in the cars and met him at the wharf.</p><p>The trial in the box lasted just seventeen hours before victory was achieved. Jones was well cared for by the Vigilance Committee and sent on his way rejoicing, feeling that Resolution, Underground Rail Road, and Liberty were invaluable.</p><p>On his way to Canada, he stopped at Albany, and the subjoined letter gives his view of things from that stand-point--</p><pre><code>MR.

After two nights of fatiguing travel at a distance of about sixty miles from home, the young aspirants for liberty were betrayed, and in an attempt made to capture them a most bloody conflict ensued. Both fugitives and pursuers were the recipients of severe wounds from gun shots, and other weapons used in the contest.</p><p>Wesley bravely used his fire arms until almost fatally wounded by one of the pursuers, who with a heavily loaded gun discharged the contents with deadly aim in his left arm, which raked the flesh from the bone for a space of about six inches in length. One of Wesley&#39;s companions also fought heroically and only yielded when badly wounded and quite overpowered. The two younger (brothers of C. Matterson) it seemed made no resistance.</p><p>In order to recall the adventures of this struggle, and the success of Wesley Harris, it is only necessary to copy the report as then penned from the lips of this young hero, while on the Underground Rail Road, even then in a very critical state. Most fearful indeed was his condition when he was brought to the Vigilance Committee in this City.</p><p>UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORD.</p><p><em>November 2d</em>, 1853.--Arrived: Robert Jackson (shot man), <em>alias</em> Wesley Harris; age twenty-two years; dark color; medium height, and of slender stature.</p><p>Robert was born in Martinsburg, Va., and was owned by Philip Pendleton. From a boy he had always been hired out. At the first of this year he commenced services with Mrs. Carroll, proprietress of the United States Hotel at Harper&#39;s Ferry. Of Mrs. Carroll he speaks in very grateful terms, saying that she was kind to him and all the servants, and promised them their freedom at her death. She excused herself for not giving them their freedom on the ground that her husband died insolvent, leaving her the responsibility of settling his debts.</p><p>But while Mrs. Carroll was very kind to her servants, her manager was equally as cruel. About a month before Wesley left, the overseer, for some trifling cause, attempted to flog him, but was resisted, and himself flogged. This resistance of the slave was regarded by the overseer as an unpardonable offence; consequently he communicated the intelligence to his owner, which had the desired effect on his mind as appeared from his answer to the overseer, which was nothing less than instructions that if he should again attempt to correct Wesley and he should repel the wholesome treatment, the overseer was to put him in prison and sell him. Whether he offended again or not, the following Christmas he was to be sold without fail.</p><p>Wesley&#39;s mistress was kind enough to apprise him of the intention of his owner and the overseer, and told him that if he could help himself he had better do so. So from that time Wesley began to contemplate how he should escape the doom which had been planned for him.</p><p>&quot;A friend,&quot; says he, &quot;by the name of C. Matterson, told me that he was going off. Then I told him of my master&#39;s writing to Mrs. Carroll concerning selling, etc., and that I was going off too. We then concluded to go together. There were two others--brothers of Matterson--who were told of our plan to escape, and readily joined with us in the undertaking. So one Saturday night, at twelve o&#39;clock, we set out for the North. After traveling upwards of two days and over sixty miles, we found ourselves unexpectedly in Terrytown, Md. There we were informed by a friendly colored man of the danger we were in and of the bad character of the place towards colored people, especially those who were escaping to freedom; and he advised us to hide as quickly as we could. We at once went to the woods and hid. Soon after we had secreted ourselves a man came near by and commenced splitting wood, or rails, which alarmed us. We then moved to another hiding-place in a thicket near a farmer&#39;s barn, where we were soon startled again by a dog approaching and barking at us. The attention of the owner of the dog was drawn to his barking and to where we were. The owner of the dog was a farmer. He asked us where we were going. We replied to Gettysburg--to visit some relatives, etc. He told us that we were running off. He then offered friendly advice, talked like a Quaker, and urged us to go with him to his barn for protection. After much persuasion, we consented to go with him.</p><p>&quot;Soon after putting us in his barn, himself and daughter prepared us a nice breakfast, which cheered our spirits, as we were hungry. For this kindness we paid him one dollar. He next told us to hide on the mow till eve, when he would safely direct us on our road to Gettysburg. All, very much fatigued from traveling, fell asleep, excepting myself; I could not sleep; I felt as if all was not right.</p><p>&quot;About noon men were heard talking around the barn. I woke my companions up and told them that that man had betrayed us. At first they did not believe me. In a moment afterwards the barn door was opened, and in came the men, eight in number. One of the men asked the owner of the barn if he had any long straw. &#39;Yes,&#39; was the answer. So up on the mow came three of the men, when, to their great surprise, as they pretended, we were discovered. The question was then asked the owner of the barn by one of the men, if he harbored runaway negroes in his barn? He answered, &#39;No,&#39; and pretended to be entirely ignorant of their being in his barn. One of the men replied that four negroes were on the mow, and he knew of it. The men then asked us where we were, going. We told them to Gettysburg, that we had aunts and a mother there. Also we spoke of a Mr. Houghman, a gentleman we happened to have some knowledge of, having seen him in Virginia. We were next asked for our passes. We told them that we hadn&#39;t any, that we had not been required to carry them where we came from. They then said that we would have to go before a magistrate, and if he allowed us to go on, well and good. The men all being armed and furnished with ropes, we were ordered to be tied. I told them if they took me they would have to take me dead or crippled. At that instant one of my friends cried out--&#39;Where is the man that betrayed us?&#39; Spying him at the same moment, he shot him (badly wounding him). Then the conflict fairly began. The constable seized me by the collar, or rather behind my shoulder. I at once shot him with my pistol, but in consequence of his throwing up his arm, which hit mine as I fired, the effect of the load of my pistol was much turned aside; his face, however, was badly burned, besides his shoulder being wounded. I again fired on the pursuers, but do not know whether I hit anybody or not. I then drew a sword, I had brought with me, and was about cutting my way to the door, when I was shot by one of the men, receiving the entire contents of one load of a double barreled gun in my left arm, that being the arm with which I was defending myself. The load brought me to the ground, and I was unable to make further struggle for myself. I was then badly beaten with guns, &amp;c. In the meantime, my friend Craven, who was defending himself, was shot badly in the face, and most violently beaten until he was conquered and tied. The two young brothers of Craven stood still, without making the least resistance. After we were fairly captured, we were taken to Terrytown, which was in sight of where we were betrayed. By this time I had lost so much blood from my wounds, that they concluded my situation was too dangerous to admit of being taken further; so I was made a prisoner at a tavern, kept by a man named Fisher. There my wounds were dressed, and thirty-two shot were taken from my arm. For three days I was crazy, and they thought I would die. During the first two weeks, while I was a prisoner at the tavern, I raised a great deal of blood, and was considered in a very dangerous condition--so much so that persons desiring to see me were not permitted. Afterwards I began to get better, and was then kept privately--was strictly watched day and night. Occasionally, however, the cook, a colored woman (Mrs. Smith), would manage to get to see me. Also James Matthews succeeded in getting to see me; consequently, as my wounds healed, and my senses came to me, I began to plan how to make another effort to escape. I asked one of the friends, alluded to above, to get me a rope. He got it. I kept it about me four days in my pocket; in the meantime I procured three nails. On Friday night, October 14th, I fastened my nails in under the window sill; tied my rope to the nails, threw my shoes out of the window, put the rope in my mouth, then took hold of it with my well hand, clambered into the window, very weak, but I managed to let myself down to the ground. I was so weak, that I could scarcely walk, but I managed to hobble off to a place three quarters of a mile from the tavern, where a friend had fixed upon for me to go, if I succeeded in making my escape. There I was found by my friend, who kept me secure till Saturday eve, when a swift horse was furnished by James Rogers, and a colored man found to conduct me to Gettysburg. Instead of going direct to Gettysburg, we took a different road, in order to shun our pursuers, as the news of my escape had created general excitement. My three other companions, who were captured, were sent to Westminster jail, where they were kept three weeks, and afterwards sent to Baltimore and sold for twelve hundred dollars a piece, as I was informed while at the tavern in Terrytown.&quot;</p><p>[Illustration: DESPERATE CONFLICT IN A BARN.]</p><p>The Vigilance Committee procured good medical attention and afforded the fugitive time for recuperation, furnished him with clothing and a free ticket, and sent him on his way greatly improved in health, and strong in the faith that, &quot;He who would be free, himself must strike the blow.&quot; His safe arrival in Canada, with his thanks, were duly announced. And some time after becoming naturalized, in one of his letters, he wrote that he was a brakesman on the Great Western R.R., (in Canada--promoted from the U.G.R.R.,) the result of being under the protection of the British Lion.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>DEATH OF ROMULUS HALL--NEW NAME GEORGE WEEMS.</p><p>In March, 1857, Abram Harris fled from John Henry Suthern, who lived near Benedict, Charles county, Md., where he was engaged in the farming business, and was the owner of about seventy head of slaves. He kept an overseer, and usually had flogging administered daily, on males and females, old and young. Abram becoming very sick of this treatment, resolved, about the first of March, to seek out the Underground Rail Road. But for his strong attachment to his wife (who was owned by Samuel Adams, but was &quot;pretty well treated&quot;), he never would have consented to suffer as he did.</p><p>Here no hope of comfort for the future seemed to remain. So Abram consulted with a fellow-servant, by the name of Romulus Hall, alias George Weems, and being very warm friends, concluded to start together. Both had wives to &quot;tear themselves from,&quot; and each was equally ignorant of the distance they had to travel, and the dangers and sufferings to be endured. But they &quot;trusted in God&quot; and kept the North Star in view. For nine days and nights, without a guide, they traveled at a very exhausting rate, especially as they had to go fasting for three days, and to endure very cold weather. Abram&#39;s companion, being about fifty years of age, felt obliged to succumb, both from hunger and cold, and had to be left on the way. Abram was a man of medium size, tall, dark chestnut color, and could read and write a little and was quite intelligent; &quot;was a member of the Mount Zion Church,&quot; and occasionally officiated as an &quot;exhorter,&quot; and really appeared to be a man of genuine faith in the Almighty, and equally as much in freedom.</p><p>In substance, Abram gave the following information concerning his knowledge of affairs on the farm under his master--</p><p>&quot;Master and mistress very frequently visited the Protestant Church, but were not members. Mistress was very bad. About three weeks before I left, the overseer, in a violent fit of bad temper, shot and badly wounded a young slave man by the name of Henry Waters, but no sooner than he got well enough he escaped, and had not been heard of up to the time Abram left. About three years before this happened, an overseer of my master was found shot dead on the road. At once some of the slaves were suspected, and were all taken to the Court House, at Serentown, St. Mary&#39;s county; but all came off clear. After this occurrence a new overseer, by the name of John Decket, was employed. Although his predecessor had been dead three years, Decket, nevertheless, concluded that it was not &#39;too late&#39; to flog the secret out of some of the slaves. Accordingly, he selected a young slave man for his victim, and flogged him so cruelly that he could scarcely walk or stand, and to keep from being actually killed, the boy told an untruth, and confessed that he and his Uncle Henry killed Webster, the overseer; whereupon the poor fellow was sent to jail to be tried for his life.&quot;</p><p>But Abram did not wait to hear the verdict. He reached the Committee safely in this city, in advance of his companion, and was furnished with a free ticket and other needed assistance, and was sent on his way rejoicing. After reaching his destination, he wrote back to know how his friend and companion (George) was getting along; but in less than three weeks after he had passed, the following brief story reveals the sad fate of poor <em>Romulus Hall</em>, who had journeyed with him till exhausted from hunger and badly frost-bitten.</p><p>A few days after his younger companion had passed on North, Romulus was brought by a pitying stranger to the Vigilance Committee, in a most shocking condition. The frost had made sad havoc with his feet and legs, so much so that all sense of feeling had departed therefrom.</p><p>[Illustration: DEATH OF ROMULUS HALL.]</p><p>How he ever reached this city is a marvel. On his arrival medical attention and other necessary comforts were provided by the Committee, who hoped with himself, that he would be restored with the loss of his toes alone. For one week he seemed to be improving; at the expiration of this time, however, his symptoms changed, indicating not only the end of slavery, but also the end of all his earthly troubles.</p><p>Lockjaw and mortification set in in the most malignant form, and for nearly thirty-six hours the unfortunate victim suffered in extreme agony, though not a murmur escaped him for having brought upon himself in seeking his liberty this painful infliction and death. It was wonderful to see how resignedly he endured his fate.</p><p>Being anxious to get his testimony relative to his escape, etc., the Chairman of the Committee took his pencil and expressed to him his wishes in the matter. Amongst other questions, he was asked: &quot;Do you regret having attempted to escape from slavery?&quot; After a severe spasm he said, as his friend was about to turn to leave the room, hopeless of being gratified in his purpose: &quot;Don&#39;t go; I have not answered your question. I am glad I escaped from slavery!&quot; He then gave his name, and tried to tell the name of his master, but was so weak he could not be understood.</p><p>At his bedside, day and night, Slavery looked more heinous than it had ever done before. Only think how this poor man, in an enlightened Christian land, for the bare hope of freedom, in a strange land amongst strangers, was obliged not only to bear the sacrifice of his wife and kindred, but also of his own life.</p><p>Nothing ever appeared more sad than seeing him in a dying posture, and instead of reaching his much coveted destination in Canada, going to that &quot;bourne whence no traveler returns.&quot; Of course it was expedient, even after his death, that only a few friends should follow him to his grave. Nevertheless, he was decently buried in the beautiful Lebanon Cemetery.</p><p>In his purse was found one single five cent piece, his whole pecuniary dependence.</p><p>This was the first instance of death on the Underground Rail Road in this region.</p><p>The Committee were indebted to the medical services of the well-known friends of the fugitive, Drs. J.L. Griscom and H.T. Childs, whose faithful services were freely given; and likewise to Mrs. H.S. Duterte and Mrs. Williams, who generously performed the offices of charity and friendship at his burial.</p><p>From his companion, who passed on Canada-ward without delay, we received a letter, from which, as an item of interest, we make the following extract:</p><pre><code>&quot;I am enjoying good health, and hope when this reaches you, you
may be enjoying the same blessing. Give my love to Mr. ----, and
family, and tell them I am in a land of liberty! I am a man
among men!&quot; (The above was addressed to the deceased.)
</code></pre><p>The subjoined letter, from Rev. L.D. Mansfield, expressed on behalf of Romulus&#39; companion, his sad feelings on hearing of his friend&#39;s death. And here it may not be inappropriate to add, that clearly enough is it to be seen, that Rev. Mansfield was one of the rare order of ministers, who believed it right &quot;to do unto others as one would be done by&quot; in practice, not in theory merely, and who felt that they could no more be excused for &quot;falling down,&quot; in obedience to the Fugitive Slave Law under President Fillmore, than could Daniel for worshiping the &quot;golden image&quot; under Nebuchadnezzar.</p><pre><code>AUBURN, NEW YORK, MAY 4TH, 1857.

DEAR BR. STILL:--Henry Lemmon wishes me to write to you in reply
to your kind letter, conveying the intelligence of the death of
your fugitive guest, Geo. Weems. He was deeply affected at the
intelligence, for he was most devotedly attached to him and had
been for many years. Mr. Lemmon now expects his sister to come
on, and wishes you to aid her in any way in your power--as he
knows you will.

He wishes you to send the coat and cap of Weems by his sister
when she comes. And when you write out the history of Weems&#39;
escape, and it is published, that you would send him a copy of
the papers. He has not been very successful in getting work yet.

Mr. and Mrs. Harris left for Canada last week. The friends made
them a purse of $15 or $20, and we hope they will do well.

Mr. Lemmon sends his respects to you and Mrs. Still. Give my
kind regards to her and accept also yourself,

Yours very truly,

L.D. MANSFIELD.

</code></pre><p>JAMES MERCER, WM. H. GILLIAM, AND JOHN CLAYTON.</p><p>STOWED AWAY IN A HOT BERTH.</p><p>This arrival came by Steamer. But they neither came in State-room nor as Cabin, Steerage, or Deck passengers.</p><p>A certain space, not far from the boiler, where the heat and coal dust were almost intolerable,--the colored steward on the boat in answer to an appeal from these unhappy bondmen, could point to no other place for concealment but this. Nor was he at all certain that they could endure the intense heat of that place. It admitted of no other posture than lying flat down, wholly shut out from the light, and nearly in the same predicament in regard to the air. Here, however, was a chance of throwing off the yoke, even if it cost them their lives. They considered and resolved to try it at all hazards.</p><p>Henry Box Brown&#39;s sufferings were nothing, compared to what these men submitted to during the entire journey.</p><p>They reached the house of one of the Committee about three o&#39;clock, A.M.</p><p>All the way from the wharf the cold rain poured down in torrents and they got completely drenched, but their hearts were swelling with joy and gladness unutterable. From the thick coating of coal dust, and the effect of the rain added thereto, all traces of natural appearance were entirely obliterated, and they looked frightful in the extreme. But they had placed their lives in mortal peril for freedom.</p><p>Every step of their critical journey was reviewed and commented on, with matchless natural eloquence,--how, when almost on the eve of suffocating in their warm berths, in order to catch a breath of air, they were compelled to crawl, one at a time, to a small aperture; but scarcely would one poor fellow pass three minutes being thus refreshed, ere the others would insist that he should &quot;go back to his hole.&quot; Air was precious, but for the time being they valued their liberty at still greater price.</p><p>After they had talked to their hearts&#39; content, and after they had been thoroughly cleansed and changed in apparel, their physical appearance could be easily discerned, which made it less a wonder whence such outbursts of eloquence had emanated. They bore every mark of determined manhood.</p><p>The date of this arrival was February 26, 1854, and the following description was then recorded--</p><p>Arrived, by Steamer Pennsylvania, James Mercer, William H. Gilliam and John Clayton, from Richmond.</p><p>James was owned by the widow, Mrs. T.E. White. He is thirty-two years of age, of dark complexion, well made, good-looking, reads and writes, is very fluent in speech, and remarkably intelligent. From a boy, he had been hired out. The last place he had the honor to fill before escaping, was with Messrs. Williams and Brother, wholesale commission merchants. For his services in this store the widow had been drawing one hundred and twenty-five dollars per annum, clear of all expenses.</p><p>He did not complain of bad treatment from his mistress, indeed, he spoke rather favorably of her. But he could not close his eyes to the fact, that at one time Mrs. White had been in possession of thirty head of slaves, although at the time he was counting the cost of escaping, two only remained--himself and William, (save a little boy) and on himself a mortgage for seven hundred and fifty dollars was then resting. He could, therefore, with his remarkably quick intellect, calculate about how long it would be before he reached the auction block.</p><p>He had a wife but no child. She was owned by Mr. Henry W. Quarles. So out of that Sodom he felt he would have to escape, even at the cost of leaving his wife behind. Of course he felt hopeful that the way would open by which she could escape at a future time, and so it did, as will appear by and by. His aged mother he had to leave also.</p><p>Wm. Henry Gilliam likewise belonged to the Widow White, and he had been hired to Messrs. White and Brother to drive their bread wagon. William was a baker by trade. For his services his mistress had received one hundred and thirty-five dollars per year. He thought his mistress quite as good, if not a little better than most slave-holders. But he had never felt persuaded to believe that she was good enough for him to remain a slave for her support.</p><p>Indeed, he had made several unsuccessful attempts before this time to escape from slavery and its horrors. He was fully posted from A to Z, but in his own person he had been smart enough to escape most of the more brutal outrages. He knew how to read and write, and in readiness of speech and general natural ability was far above the average of slaves.</p><p>He was twenty-five years of age, well made, of light complexion, and might be put down as a valuable piece of property.</p><p>This loss fell with crushing weight upon the kind-hearted mistress, as will be seen in a letter subjoined which she wrote to the unfaithful William, some time after he had fled.</p><p>LETTER FROM MRS. L.E. WHITE.</p><pre><code>RICHMOND, 16th, 1854.

DEAR HENRY:--Your mother and myself received your letter; she is
much distressed at your conduct; she is remaining just as you
left her, she says, and she will never be reconciled to your
conduct.

I think Henry, you have acted most dishonorably; had you have
made a confidant of me I would have been better off; and you as
you are. I am badly situated, living with Mrs. Palmer, and
having to put up with everything--your mother is also
dissatisfied--I am miserably poor, do not get a cent of your
hire or James&#39;, besides losing you both, but if you can
_reconcile_ so do. By renting a cheap house, I might have lived,
now it seems starvation is before me. Martha and the Doctor are
living in Portsmouth, it is not in her power to do much for me.
I know you will repent it. I heard six weeks before you went,
that you were trying to persuade him off--but we all liked you,
and I was unwilling to believe it--however, I leave it in God&#39;s
hands He will know what to do. Your mother says that I must tell
you servant Jones is _dead_ and old _Mrs. Galt_. Kit is well,
but we are very uneasy, losing your and _James&#39; hire_, I fear
poor little fellow, that he will be obliged to go, as I am
compelled to live, and it will be your fault. I am quite unwell,
but of course, you don&#39;t care.

Yours,

L.E. WHITE.

If you choose to come back you could. I would do a very good
part by you, Toler and Cooke has none.
</code></pre><p>This touching epistle was given by the disobedient William to a member of the Vigilant Committee, when on a visit to Canada, in 1855, and it was thought to be of too much value to be lost. It was put away with other valuable U.G.R.R. documents for future reference. Touching the &quot;rascality&quot; of William and James and the unfortunate predicament in which it placed the kind-hearted widow, Mrs. Louisa White, the following editorial clipped from the wide-awake Richmond Despatch, was also highly appreciated, and preserved as conclusive testimony to the successful working of the U.G.R.R. in the Old Dominion. It reads thus--</p><p>&quot;RASCALITY SOMEWHERE.--We called attention yesterday to the advertisement of two negroes belonging to Mrs. Louisa White, by Toler &amp; Cook, and in the call we expressed the opinion that they were still lurking about the city, preparatory to going off. Mr. Toler, we find, is of a different opinion. He believes that they have already cleared themselves--have escaped to a Free State, and we think it extremely probable that he is in the right. They were both of them uncommonly intelligent negroes. One of them, the one hired to Mr. White, was a tip-top baker. He had been all about the country, and had been in the habit of supplying the U.S. Pennsylvania with bread; Mr. W. having the contract. In his visits for this purpose, of course, he formed acquaintances with all sorts of sea-faring characters; and there is every reason to believe that he has been assisted to get off in that way, along with the other boy, hired to the Messrs. Williams. That the two acted in concert, can admit of no doubt. The question is now to find out how they got off. They must undoubtedly have had white men in the secret. Have we then a nest of Abolition scoundrels among us? There ought to be a law to put a police officer on board every vessel as soon as she lands at the wharf. There is one, we believe for inspecting vessels before they leave.

Had it been otherwise, they would never have had an opportunity to escape, as they have done. Their flight has left her penniless. Either of them would readily have sold for $1200; and Mr. Toler advised their owner to sell them at the commencement of the year, probably anticipating the very thing that has happened. She refused to do so, because she felt too much attachment to them.

MR. STILL, DEAR FRIEND:--I received a letter from the poor old
widow, Mrs. L.E. White, and she says I may come back if I choose
and she will do a good part by me. Yes, yes I am choosing the
western side of the South for my home. She is smart, but cannot
bung my eye, so she shall have to die in the poor house at last,
so she says, and Mercer and myself will be the cause of it. That
is all right. I am getting even with her now for I was in the
poor house for twenty-five years and have just got out. And she
said she knew I was coming away six weeks before I started, so
you may know my chance was slim. But Mr. John Wright said I came
off like a gentleman and he did not blame me for coming for I
was a great boy. Yes I here him enough he is all gas. I am in
Canada, and they cannot help themselves.

About that subject I will not say anything more. You must write

He was owned by the Widow Clayton, and was white enough to have been nearly related to her, being a mulatto. He was about thirty-five years of age, a man of fine appearance, and quite intelligent. Several years previous he had made an attempt to escape, but failed. Prior to escaping in this instance, he had been laboring in a tobacco factory at $150 a year. It is needless to say that he did not approve of the &quot;peculiar institution.&quot; He left a wife and one child behind to mourn after him.

</code></pre><p>CLARISSA DAVIS.</p><p>ARRIVED DRESSED IN MALE ATTIRE.</p><p>Clarissa fled from Portsmouth, Va., in May, 1854, with two of her brothers. Two months and a half before she succeeded in getting off, Clarissa had made a desperate effort, but failed. The brothers succeeded, but she was left. She had not given up all hope of escape, however, and therefore sought &quot;a safe hiding-place until an opportunity might offer,&quot; by which she could follow her brothers on the U.G.R.R. Clarissa was owned by Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Burkley, of Portsmouth, under whom she had always served.</p><p>Of them she spoke favorably, saying that she &quot;had not been used as hard as many others were.&quot; At this period, Clarissa was about twenty-two years of age, of a bright brown complexion, with handsome features, exceedingly respectful and modest, and possessed all the characteristics of a well-bred young lady. For one so little acquainted with books as she was, the correctness of her speech was perfectly astonishing.</p><p>For Clarissa and her two brothers a &quot;reward of one thousand dollars&quot; was kept standing in the papers for a length of time, as these (articles) were considered very rare and valuable; the best that could be produced in Virginia.</p><p>In the meanwhile the brothers had passed safely on to New Bedford, but Clarissa remained secluded, &quot;waiting for the storm to subside.&quot; Keeping up courage day by day, for seventy-five days, with the fear of being detected and severely punished, and then sold, after all her hopes and struggles, required the faith of a martyr. Time after time, when she hoped to succeed in making her escape, ill luck seemed to disappoint her, and nothing but intense suffering appeared to be in store. Like many others, under the crushing weight of oppression, she thought she &quot;should have to die&quot; ere she tasted liberty. In this state of mind, one day, word was conveyed to her that the steamship, City of Richmond, had arrived from Philadelphia, and that the steward on board (with whom she was acquainted), had consented to secrete her this trip, if she could manage to reach the ship safely, which was to start the next day. This news to Clarissa was both cheering and painful. She had been &quot;praying all the time while waiting,&quot; but now she felt &quot;that if it would only rain right hard the next morning about three o&#39;clock, to drive the police officers off the street, then she could safely make her way to the boat.&quot; Therefore she prayed anxiously all that day that it would rain, &quot;but no sign of rain appeared till towards midnight.&quot; The prospect looked horribly discouraging; but she prayed on, and at the appointed hour (three o&#39;clock--before day), the rain descended in torrents. Dressed in male attire, Clarissa left the miserable coop where she had been almost without light or air for two and a half months, and unmolested, reached the boat safely, and was secreted in a box by Wm. Bagnal, a clever young man who sincerely sympathized with the slave, having a wife in slavery himself; and by him she was safely delivered into the hands of the Vigilance Committee.</p><p>Clarissa Davis here, by advice of the Committee, dropped her old name, and was straightway christened &quot;Mary D. Armstead.&quot; Desiring to join her brothers and sister in New Bedford, she was duly furnished with her U.G.R.R. passport and directed thitherward. Her father, who was left behind when she got off, soon after made his way on North, and joined his children. He was too old and infirm probably to be worth anything, and had been allowed to go free, or to purchase himself for a mere nominal sum. Slaveholders would, on some such occasions, show wonderful liberality in letting their old slaves go free, when they could work no more. After reaching New Bedford, Clarissa manifested her gratitude in writing to her friends in Philadelphia repeatedly, and evinced a very lively interest in the U.G.R.R. The appended letter indicates her sincere feelings of gratitude and deep interest in the cause--</p><pre><code>NEW BEDFORD, August 26, 1855.

</code></pre><p>ANTHONY BLOW, ALIAS HENRY LEVISON.</p><p>SECRETED TEN MONTHS BEFORE STARTING--EIGHT DAYS STOWED AWAY ON A STEAMER BOUND FOR PHILADELPHIA.</p><p>Arrived from Norfolk, about the 1st of November, 1854. Ten months before starting, Anthony had been closely concealed. He belonged to the estate of Mrs. Peters, a widow, who had been dead about one year before his concealment.</p><p>On the settlement of his old mistress&#39; estate, which was to take place one year after her death, Anthony was to be transferred to Mrs. Lewis, a daughter of Mrs. Peters (the wife of James Lewis, Esq.). Anthony felt well satisfied that he was not the slave to please the &quot;tyrannical whims&quot; of his anticipated master, young Lewis, and of course he hated the idea of having to come under his yoke. And what made it still more unpleasant for Anthony was that Mr. Lewis would frequently remind him that it was his intention to &quot;sell him as soon as he got possession--the first day of January.&quot; &quot;I can get fifteen hundred dollars for you easily, and I will do it.&quot; This contemptuous threat had caused Anthony&#39;s blood to boil time and again. But Anthony had to take the matter as calmly as possible, which, however, he was not always able to do.</p><p>At any rate, Anthony concluded that his &quot;young master had counted the chickens before they were hatched.&quot; Indeed here Anthony began to be a deep thinker. He thought, for instance, that he had already been shot three times, at the instance of slave-holders. The first time he was shot was for refusing a flogging when only eighteen years of age. The second time, he was shot in the head with squirrel shot by the sheriff, who was attempting to arrest him for having resisted three &quot;young white ruffians,&quot; who wished to have the pleasure of beating him, but got beaten themselves. And in addition to being shot this time, Anthony was still further &quot;broke in&quot; by a terrible flogging from the Sheriff. The third time Anthony was shot he was about twenty-one years of age. In this instance he was punished for his old offence--he &quot;would not be whipped.&quot;</p><p>This time his injury from being shot was light, compared with the two preceding attacks. Also in connection with these murderous conflicts, he could not forget that he had been sold on the auction block. But he had still deeper thinking to do yet. He determined that his young master should never get &quot;fifteen hundred dollars for him on the 1st of January,&quot; unless he got them while he (Anthony) was running. For Anthony had fully made up his mind that when the last day of December ended, his bondage should end also, even if he should have to accept death as a substitute. He then began to think of the Underground Rail Road and of Canada; but who the agents were, or how to find the depot, was a serious puzzle to him. But his time was getting so short he was convinced that whatever he did would have to be done quickly. In this frame of mind he found a man who professed to know something about the Underground Rail Road, and for &quot;thirty dollars&quot; promised to aid him in the matter.</p><p>The thirty dollars were raised by the hardest effort and passed over to the pretended friend, with the expectation that it would avail greatly in the emergency. But Anthony found himself sold for thirty dollars, as nothing was done for him. However, the 1st day of January arrived, but Anthony was not to be found to answer to his name at roll call. He had &quot;took out&quot; very early in the morning. Daily he prayed in his place of concealment how to find the U.G.R.R. Ten months passed away, during which time he suffered almost death, but persuaded himself to believe that even that was better than slavery. With Anthony, as it has been with thousands of others similarly situated, just as everything was looking the most hopeless, word came to him in his place of concealment that a friend named Minkins, employed on the steamship City of Richmond, would undertake to conceal him on the boat, if he could be crowded in a certain place, which was about the only spot that would be perfectly safe. This was glorious news to Anthony; but it was well for him that he was ignorant of the situation that awaited him on the boat, or his heart might have failed him. He was willing, however, to risk his life for freedom, and, therefore, went joyfully.</p><p>The hiding-place was small and he was large. A sitting attitude was the only way he could possibly occupy it. He was contented. This place was &quot;near the range, directly over the boiler,&quot; and of course, was very warm. Nevertheless, Anthony felt that he would not murmur, as he knew what suffering was pretty well, and especially as he took it for granted that he would be free in about a day and a half--the usual time it took the steamer to make her trip. At the appointed hour the steamer left Norfolk for Philadelphia, with Anthony sitting flat down in his U.G.R.R. berth, thoughtful and hopeful. But before the steamer had made half her distance the storm was tossing the ship hither and thither fearfully. Head winds blew terribly, and for a number of days the elements seemed perfectly mad. In addition to the extraordinary state of the weather, when the storm subsided the fog took its place and held the mastery of the ship with equal despotism until the end of over seven days, when finally the storm, wind, and fog all disappeared, and on the eighth day of her boisterous passage the steamship City of Richmond landed at the wharf of Philadelphia, with this giant and hero on board who had suffered for ten months in his concealment on land and for eight days on the ship.</p><p>Anthony was of very powerful physical proportions, being six feet three inches in height, quite black, very intelligent, and of a temperament that would not submit to slavery. For some years his master, Col. Cunnagan, had hired him out in Washington, where he was accused of being in the schooner Pearl, with Capt. Drayton&#39;s memorable &quot;seventy fugitives on board, bound for Canada.&quot; At this time he was stoker in a machine shop, and was at work on an anchor weighing &quot;ten thousand pounds.&quot; In the excitement over the attempt to escape in the Pearl, many were arrested, and the officers with irons visited Anthony at the machine shop to arrest him, but he declined to let them put the hand-cuffs on him, but consented to go with them, if permitted to do so without being ironed. The officers yielded, and Anthony went willingly to the jail. Passing unnoticed other interesting conflicts in his hard life, suffice it to say, he left his wife, Ann, and three children, Benjamin, John and Alfred, all owned by Col. Cunnagan. In this brave-hearted man, the Committee felt a deep interest, and accorded him their usual hospitalities.</p><p>PERRY JOHNSON, OF ELKTON, MARYLAND.</p><p>EYE KNOCKED OUT, ETC.</p><p>Perry&#39;s exit was in November, 1853. He was owned by Charles Johnson, who lived at Elkton. The infliction of a severe &quot;flogging&quot; from the hand of his master awakened Perry to consider the importance of the U.G.R.R. Perry had the misfortune to let a &quot;load of fodder upset,&quot; about which his master became exasperated, and in his agitated state of mind he succeeded in affixing a number of very ugly stationary marks on Perry&#39;s back. However, this was no new thing. Indeed he had suffered at the hands of his mistress even far more keenly than from these &quot;ugly marks.&quot; He had but one eye; the other he had been deprived of by a terrible stroke with a cowhide in the &quot;hand of his mistress.&quot; This lady he pronounced to be a &quot;perfect savage,&quot; and added that &quot;she was in the habit of cowhiding any of her slaves whenever she felt like it, which was quite often.&quot; Perry was about twenty-eight years of age and a man of promise. The Committee attended to his wants and forwarded him on North.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>ISAAC FORMAN, WILLIAM DAVIS, AND WILLIS REDICK.</p><p>HEARTS FULL OF JOY FOR FREEDOM--VERY ANXIOUS FOR WIVES IN SLAVERY.</p><p>These passengers all arrived together, concealed, per steamship City of Richmond, December, 1853. Isaac Forman, the youngest of the party--twenty-three years of age and a dark mulatto--would be considered by a Southerner capable of judging as &quot;very likely.&quot; He fled from a widow by the name of Mrs. Sanders, who had been in the habit of hiring him out for &quot;one hundred and twenty dollars a year.&quot; She belonged in Norfolk, Va.; so did Isaac. For four years Isaac had served in the capacity of steward on the steamship Augusta. He stated that he had a wife living in Richmond, and that she was confined the morning he took the U.G.R.R. Of course he could not see her. The privilege of living in Richmond with his wife &quot;had been denied him.&quot; Thus, fearing to render her unhappy, he was obliged to conceal from her his intention to escape. &quot;Once or twice in the year was all the privilege allowed&quot; him to visit her. This only added &quot;insult to injury,&quot; in Isaac&#39;s opinion; wherefore he concluded that he would make one less to have to suffer thus, and common sense said he was wise in the matter. No particular charges are found recorded on the U.G.R.R. books against the mistress. He went to Canada.</p><p>In the subjoined letters (about his wife) is clearly revealed the sincere gratitude he felt towards those who aided him: at the same time it may be seen how the thought of his wife being in bondage grieved his heart. It would have required men with stone hearts to have turned deaf ears to such appeals.

MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Sir_--Your kind letter arrived safe at hand

</code></pre><p>Another letter from Isaac. He is very gloomy and his heart is almost breaking about his wife.</p><p>SECOND LETTER.</p><pre><code>TORONTO, May 7,1854.

MR. W. STILL:--_Dear Sir_--I take this opportunity of writing
you these few lines and hope when they reach you they will find
you well. I would have written you before, but I was waiting to
hear from my friend, Mr. Brown. I judge his business has been of
importance as the occasion why he has not written before. Dear
sir, nothing would have prevented me from writing, in a case of
this kind, except death.

My soul is vexed, my troubles are inexpressible. I often feel as
if I were willing to die. I must see my wife in short, if not, I
will die. What would I not give no tongue can utter. Just to
gaze on her sweet lips one moment I would be willing to die the
next. I am determined to see her some time or other. The thought
of being a slave again is miserable. I hope heaven will smile
upon me again, before I am one again. I will leave Canada again
shortly, but I don&#39;t name the place that I go, it may be in the
bottom of the ocean. If I had known as much before I left, as I
do now, I would never have left until I could have found means
to have brought her with me. You have never suffered from being
absent from a wife, as I have. I consider that to be nearly
superior to death, and hope you will do all you can for me, and
inquire from your friends if nothing can be done for me. Please
write to me immediately on receipt of this, and say something
that will cheer up my drooping spirits. You will oblige me by
seeing Mr. Brown and ask him if he would oblige me by going to
Richmond and see my wife, and see what arrangements he could
make with her, and I would be willing to pay all his expenses
there and back. Please to see both Mr. Bagnel and Mr. Minkins,
and ask them if they have seen my wife. I am determined to see
her, if I die the next moment. I can say I was once happy, but
never will be again, until I see her; because what is freedom to
me, when I know that my wife is in slavery? Those persons that
you shipped a few weeks ago, remained at St. Catherine, instead
of coming over to Toronto. I sent you two letters last week and
I hope you will please attend to them. The post-office is shut,
so I enclose the money to pay the post, and please write me in
haste.

I remain evermore your obedient servant,

I. FORMAN.
</code></pre><p>WILLIS REDICK.</p><p>He was owned by S.J. Wilson, a merchant, living in Portsmouth, Va. Willis was of a very dark hue, thick set, thirty-two years of age, and possessed of a fair share of mind. The owner had been accustomed to hire Willis out for &quot;one hundred dollars a year.&quot; Willis thought his lot &quot;pretty hard,&quot; and his master rather increased this notion by his severity, and especially by &quot;threatening&quot; to sell him. He had enjoyed, as far as it was expected for a slave to do, &quot;five months of married life,&quot; but he loved slavery no less on this account. In fact he had just begun to consider what it was to have a wife and children that he &quot;could not own or protect,&quot; and who were claimed as another&#39;s property. Consequently he became quite restive under these reflections and his master&#39;s ill-usage, and concluded to &quot;look out,&quot; without consulting either the master or the young wife.</p><p>This step looked exceedingly hard, but what else could the poor fellow do? Slavery existed expressly for the purpose of crushing souls and breaking tender hearts.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>WILLIAM DAVIS.</p><p>William might be described as a good-looking mulatto, thirty-one years of age, and capable of thinking for himself. He made no grave complaints of ill-usage under his master, &quot;Joseph Reynolds,&quot; who lived at Newton, Portsmouth, Va. However, his owner had occasionally &quot;threatened to sell him.&quot; As this was too much for William&#39;s sensitive feelings, he took umbrage at it and made a hasty and hazardous move, which resulted in finding himself on the U.G.R.R. The most serious regret William had to report to the Committee was, that he was compelled to &quot;leave&quot; his &quot;wife,&quot; Catharine, and his little daughter, Louisa, two years and one month, and an infant son seven months old. He evidently loved them very tenderly, but saw no way by which he could aid them, as long as he was daily liable to be put on the auction block and sold far South. This argument was regarded by the Committee as logical and unanswerable; consequently they readily endorsed his course, while they deeply sympathized with his poor wife and little ones. &quot;Before escaping,&quot; he &quot;dared not&quot; even apprise his wife and child, whom he had to leave behind in the prison house.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Clark. Being uncommonly smart and quite good-looking at the same time, he was a saleable piece of merchandise. Without consulting his view of the matter or making the least intimation of any change, the master one day struck up a bargain with a trader for Joseph, and received <em>Fourteen Hundred Dollars cash</em> in consideration thereof. Mr. Robert Parrett, of Parson &amp; King&#39;s Express office, happened to have a knowledge of what had transpired, and thinking pretty well of Joseph, confidentially put him in full possession of all the facts in the case. For reflection he hardly had five minutes. But he at once resolved to strike that day for freedom--not to go home that evening to be delivered into the hands of his new master. In putting into execution his bold resolve, he secreted himself, and so remained for three weeks. In the meantime his mother, who was a slave, resolved to escape also, but after one week&#39;s gloomy foreboding, she became &quot;faint-hearted and gave the struggle over.&quot; But Joseph did not know what surrender meant. His sole thought was to procure a ticket on the U.G.R.R. for Canada, which by persistent effort he succeeded in doing. He hid himself in a steamer, and by this way reached Philadelphia, where he received every accommodation at the usual depot, was provided with a free ticket, and sent off rejoicing for Canada.

He spoke rather kindly of her, and felt that he &quot;had not been used very hard&quot; as a general thing, although, he wisely added, &quot;the best usage was bad enough.&quot; Sheridan had nearly reached his twenty-eighth year, was tall and well made, and possessed of a considerable share of intelligence.</p><p>Not a great while before making up his mind to escape, for some trifling offence he had been &quot;stretched up with a rope by his hands,&quot; and &quot;whipped unmercifully.&quot; In addition to this he had &quot;got wind of the fact,&quot; that he was to be auctioneered off; soon these things brought serious reflections to Sheridan&#39;s mind, and among other questions, he began to ponder how he could get a ticket on the U.G.R.R., and get out of this &quot;place of torment,&quot; to where he might have the benefit of his own labor. In this state of mind, about the fourteenth day of November, he took his first and daring step. He went not, however, to learned lawyers or able ministers of the Gospel in his distress and trouble, but wended his way &quot;directly to the woods,&quot; where he felt that he would be safer with the wild animals and reptiles, in solitude, than with the barbarous civilization that existed in Portsmouth.</p><p>The first day in the woods he passed in prayer incessantly, all alone. In this particular place of seclusion he remained &quot;four days and nights,&quot; &quot;two days suffered severely from hunger, cold and thirst.&quot; However, one who was a &quot;friend&quot; to him, and knew of his whereabouts, managed to get some food to him and consoling words; but at the end of the four days this friend got into some difficulty and thus Sheridan was left to &quot;wade through deep waters and head winds&quot; in an almost hopeless state. There he could not consent to stay and starve to death. Accordingly he left and found another place of seclusion--with a friend in the town--for a pecuniary consideration. A secret passage was procured for him on one of the steamers running between Philadelphia and Richmond, Va. When he left his poor wife, Julia, she was then &quot;lying in prison to be sold,&quot; on the simple charge of having been suspected of conniving at her husband&#39;s escape. As a woman she had known something of the &quot;barbarism of slavery&quot;, from every-day experience, which the large scars about her head indicated--according to Sheridan&#39;s testimony. She was the mother of two children, but had never been allowed to have the care of either of them. The husband, utterly powerless to offer her the least sympathy in word or deed, left this dark habitation of cruelty, as above referred to, with no hope of ever seeing wife or child again in this world.</p><p>The Committee afforded him the usual aid and comfort, and passed him on to the next station, with his face set towards Boston. He had heard the slaveholders &quot;curse&quot; Boston so much, that he concluded it must be a pretty safe place for the fugitive.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>JOSEPH KNEELAND, ALIAS JOSEPH HULSON.</p><p>Joseph Kneeland arrived November 25, 1853. He was a prepossessing man of twenty-six, dark complexion, and intelligent. At the time of Joseph&#39;s escape, he was owned by Jacob Kneeland, who had fallen heir to him as a part of his father&#39;s estate. Joseph spoke of his old master as having treated him &quot;pretty well,&quot; but he had an idea that his young master had a very &quot;malignant spirit;&quot; for even before the death of his old master, the heir wanted him, &quot;Joe,&quot; sold, and after the old man died, matters appeared to be coming to a crisis very fast. Even as early as November, the young despot had distinctly given &quot;Joe&quot; to understand, that he was not to be hired out another year, intimating that he was to &quot;go somewhere,&quot; but as to particulars, it was time enough for Joe to know them.</p><p>Of course &quot;Joe&quot; looked at his master &quot;right good&quot; and saw right through him, and at the same time, saw the U.G.R.R., &quot;darkly.&quot; Daily slavery grew awfully mean, but on the other hand, Canada was looked upon as a very desirable country to emigrate to, and he concluded to make his way there, as speedily as the U.G.R.R. could safely convey him. Accordingly he soon carried his design into practice, and on his arrival, the Committee regarded him as a very good subject for her British Majesty&#39;s possessions in Canada.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>EX-PRESIDENT TYLER&#39;S HOUSEHOLD LOSES AN ARISTOCRATIC &quot;ARTICLE.&quot;</p><p>James Hambleton Christian is a remarkable specimen of the &quot;well fed, &amp;c.&quot; In talking with him relative to his life as a slave, he said very promptly, &quot;I have always been treated well; if I only have half as good times in the North as I have had in the South, I shall be perfectly satisfied. Any time I desired spending money, five or ten dollars were no object.&quot; At times, James had borrowed of his master, one, two, and three hundred dollars, to loan out to some of his friends. With regard to apparel and jewelry, he had worn the best, as an every-day adornment. With regard to food also, he had fared as well as heart could wish, with abundance of leisure time at his command. His deportment was certainly very refined and gentlemanly. About fifty per cent. of Anglo-Saxon blood was visible in his features and his hair, which gave him no inconsiderable claim to sympathy and care. He had been to William and Mary&#39;s College in his younger days, to wait on young master James B.C., where, through the kindness of some of the students he had picked up a trifling amount of book learning. To be brief, this man was born the slave of old Major Christian, on the Glen Plantation, Charles City county, Va. The Christians were wealthy and owned many slaves, and belonged in reality to the F.F.V&#39;s. On the death of the old Major, James fell into the hands of his son, Judge Christian, who was executor to his father&#39;s estate. Subsequently he fell into the hands of one of the Judge&#39;s sisters, Mrs. John Tyler (wife of Ex-President Tyler), and then he became a member of the President&#39;s domestic household, was at the White House, under the President, from 1841 to 1845. Though but very young at that time, James was only fit for training in the arts, science, and mystery of waiting, in which profession, much pains were taken to qualify him completely for his calling.</p><p>After a lapse of time; his mistress died. According to her request, after this event, James and his old mother were handed over to her nephew, William H. Christian, Esq., a merchant of Richmond. From this gentleman, James had the folly to flee.</p><p>Passing hurriedly over interesting details, received from him respecting his remarkable history, two or three more incidents too good to omit must suffice.</p><p>&quot;How did you like Mr. Tyler?&quot; said an inquisitive member of the Vigilance Committee. &quot;I didn&#39;t like Mr. Tyler much,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Why?&quot; again inquired the member of the Committee. &quot;Because Mr. Tyler was a poor man. I never did like poor people. I didn&#39;t like his marrying into our family, who were considered very far Tyler&#39;s superiors.&quot; &quot;On the plantation,&quot; he said, &quot;Tyler was a very cross man, and treated the servants very cruelly; but the house servants were treated much better, owing to their having belonged to his wife, who protected them from persecution, as they had been favorite servants in her father&#39;s family.&quot; James estimated that &quot;Tyler got about thirty-five thousand dollars and twenty-nine slaves, young and old, by his wife.&quot;</p><p>What prompted James to leave such pleasant quarters? It was this: He had become enamored of a young and respectable free girl in Richmond, with whom he could not be united in marriage solely because he was a slave, and did not own himself. The frequent sad separations of such married couples (where one or the other was a slave) could not be overlooked; consequently, the poor fellow concluded that he would stand a better chance of gaining his object in Canada than by remaining in Virginia. So he began to feel that he might himself be sold some day, and thus the resolution came home to him very forcibly to make tracks for Canada.</p><p>In speaking of the good treatment he had always met with, a member of the Committee remarked, &quot;You must be akin to some one of your master&#39;s family?&quot; To which he replied, &quot;I am Christian&#39;s son.&quot; Unquestionably this passenger was one of that happy class so commonly referred to by apologists for the &quot;Patriarchal Institution.&quot; The Committee, feeling a deep interest in his story, and desiring great success to him in his Underground efforts to get rid of slavery, and at the same time possess himself of his affianced, made him heartily welcome, feeling assured that the struggles and hardships he had submitted to in escaping, as well as the luxuries he was leaving behind, were nothing to be compared with the blessings of liberty and a free wife in Canada.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

</code></pre><p>FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORDS.</p><p>The following memorandum is made, which, if not too late, may afford some light to &quot;Elizabeth Brown and Thomas Johnson,&quot; if they have not already gone the way of the &quot;lost cause&quot;--</p><p><em>June</em> 4, 1857.--Edward is a hardy and firm-looking young man of twenty-four years of age, chestnut color, medium size, and &quot;likely,&quot;--would doubtless bring $1,400 in the market. He had been held as the property of the widow, &quot;Betsy Brown,&quot; who resided near Mill Green P.O., in Harford county, Md. &quot;She was a very bad woman; would go to church every Sunday, come home and go to fighting amongst the colored people; was never satisfied; she treated my mother very hard, (said Ed.); would beat her with a walking-stick, &amp;c. She was an old woman and belonged to the Catholic Church. Over her slaves she kept an overseer, who was a very wicked man; very bad on colored people; his name was &#39;Bill Eddy;&#39; Elizabeth Brown owned twelve head.&quot;</p><p>Henry is of a brown skin, a good-looking young man, only nineteen years of age, whose prepossessing appearance would insure a high price for him in the market--perhaps $1,700. With Edward, he testifies to the meanness of Mrs. Betsy Brown, as well as to his own longing desire for freedom. Being a fellow-servant with Edward, Henry was a party to the plan of escape. In slavery he left his mother and three sisters, owned by the &quot;old woman&quot; from whom he escaped.</p><p>James is about twenty-one years of age, full black, and medium size. As he had been worked hard on poor fare, he concluded to leave, in company with his brother and two cousins, leaving his parents in slavery, owned by the &quot;Widow Pyle,&quot; who was also the owner of himself. &quot;She was upwards of eighty, very passionate and ill-natured, although a member of the Presbyterian Church.&quot; James may be worth $1,400.</p><p>Stephen is a brother of James&#39;, and is about the same size, though a year older. His experience differed in no material respect from his brother&#39;s; was owned by the same woman, whom he &quot;hated for her bad treatment&quot; of him. Would bring $1,400, perhaps.</p><p>In substance, and to a considerable extent in the exact words, these facts are given as they came from the lips of the passengers, who, though having been kept in ignorance and bondage, seemed to have their eyes fully open to the wrongs that had been heaped upon them, and were singularly determined to reach free soil at all hazards. The Committee willingly attended to their financial and other wants, and cheered them on with encouraging advice.</p><p>They were indebted to &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; for the advertisement information. And here it may be further added, that the &quot;Sun&quot; was quite famous for this kind of U.G.R.R. literature, and on that account alone the Committee subscribed for it daily, and never failed to scan closely certain columns, illustrated with a black man running away with a bundle on his back. Many of these popular illustrations and advertisements were preserved, many others were sent away to friends at a distance, who took a special interest in the U.G.R.R. matters. Friends and stockholders in England used to take a great interest in seeing how the fine arts, in these particulars, were encouraged in the South (&quot;the land of chivalry&quot;).</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>HENRY PREDO.</p><p>BROKE JAIL, JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND MADE HIS ESCAPE.</p><p>Henry fled from Buckstown, Dorchester Co., Md., March, 1857. Physically he is a giant. About 27 years of age, stout and well-made, quite black, and no fool, as will appear presently. Only a short time before he escaped, his master threatened to sell him south. To avoid that fate, therefore, he concluded to try his luck on the Underground Rail Road, and, in company with seven others--two of them females--he started for Canada. For two or three days and nights they managed to outgeneral all their adversaries, and succeeded bravely in making the best of their way to a Free State.</p><p>In the meantime, however, a reward of $3,000 was offered for their arrest. This temptation was too great to be resisted, even by the man who had been intrusted with the care of them, and who had faithfully promised to pilot them to a safe place. One night, through the treachery of their pretended conductor, they were all taken into Dover Jail, where the Sheriff and several others, who had been notified beforehand by the betrayer, were in readiness to receive them. Up stairs they were taken, the betrayer remarking as they were going up, that they were &quot;cold, but would soon have a good warming.&quot; On a light being lit they discovered the iron bars and the fact that they had been betrayed. Their liberty-loving spirits and purposes, however, did not quail. Though resisted brutally by the sheriff with revolver in hand, they made their way down one flight of stairs, and in the moment of excitement, as good luck would have it, plunged into the sheriff&#39;s private apartment, where his wife and children were sleeping. The wife cried murder lustily. A shovel full of fire, to the great danger of burning the premises, was scattered over the room; out of the window jumped two of the female fugitives. Our hero Henry, seizing a heavy andiron, smashed out the window entire, through which the others leaped a distance of twelve feet. The railing or wall around the jail, though at first it looked forbidding, was soon surmounted by a desperate effort.</p><p>At this stage of the proceedings, Henry found himself without the walls, and also lost sight of his comrades at the same time. The last enemy he spied was the sheriff in his stockings without his shoes. He snapped his pistol at him, but it did not go off. Six of the others, however, marvellously got off safely together; where the eighth went, or how he got off, was not known.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>DANIEL HUGHES.</p><p>Daniel fled from Buckstown, Dorchester Co., also. His owner&#39;s name was Richard Meredith, a farmer. Daniel is one of the eight alluded to above. In features he is well made, dark chestnut color, and intelligent, possessing an ardent thirst for liberty. The cause of his escape was: &quot;Worked hard in all sorts of weather--in rain and snow,&quot; so he thought he would &quot;go where colored men are free.&quot; His master was considered the hardest man around. His mistress was &quot;eighty-three years of age,&quot; &quot;drank hard,&quot; was &quot;very stormy,&quot; and a &quot;member of the Methodist Church&quot; (Airy&#39;s meeting-house). He left brothers and sisters, and uncles and aunts behind. In the combat at the prison he played his part manfully.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>THOMAS ELLIOTT.</p><p>Thomas is also one of the brave eight who broke out of Dover Jail. He was about twenty-three years of age, well made, wide awake, and of a superb black complexion. He too had been owned by Richard Meredith. Against the betrayer, who was a black man, he had vengeance in store if the opportunity should ever offer. Thomas left only one brother living; his &quot;father and mother were dead.&quot;</p><p>The excitement over the escape spread very rapidly next morning, and desperate efforts were made to recapture the fugitives, but a few friends there were who had sympathy and immediately rendered them the needed assistance.</p><p>The appended note from the faithful Garrett to Samuel Rhoads, may throw light upon the occurrence to some extent.</p><pre><code>WILMINGTON, 3d mo. 13th, 1857.

DEAR COUSIN, SAMUEL RHOADS:--I have a letter this day from an
agent of the Underground Rail Road, near Dover, in this state,
saying I must be on the look out for six brothers and two
sisters, they were decoyed and betrayed, he says by a colored
man named Thomas Otwell, who pretended to be their friend, and
sent a _white scamp_ ahead to wait for them at Dover till they
arrived; they were arrested and put in Jail there, with Tom&#39;s
assistance, and some officers. On third day morning about four
o&#39;clock, they broke jail; six of them are secreted in the
neighborhood, and the writer has not known what became of the
other two. The six were to start last night for this place. I
hear that their owners have persons stationed at several places
on the road watching. I fear they will be taken. If they could
lay quiet for ten days or two weeks, they might then get up
safe. I shall have two men sent this evening some four or five
miles below to keep them away from this town, and send them (if
found to Chester County). Thee may show this to Still and McKim,
and oblige thy cousin,

THOMAS GARRETT.

</code></pre><p>MARY EPPS, ALIAS EMMA BROWN--JOSEPH AND ROBERT ROBINSON.</p><p>A SLAVE MOTHER LOSES HER SPEECH AT THE SALE OF HER CHILD--BOB ESCAPES FROM HIS MASTER, A TRADER, WITH $1500 IN NORTH CAROLINA MONEY.</p><p>Mary fled from Petersburg and the Robinsons from Richmond. A fugitive slave law-breaking captain by the name of B., who owned a schooner, and would bring any kind of freight that would pay the most, was the conductor in this instance. Quite a number of passengers at different times availed themselves of his accommodations and thus succeeded in reaching Canada.</p><p>His risk was very great. On this account he claimed, as did certain others, that it was no more than fair to charge for his services--indeed he did not profess to bring persons for nothing, except in rare instances. In this matter the Committee did not feel disposed to interfere directly in any way, further than to suggest that whatever understanding was agreed upon by the parties themselves should be faithfully adhered to.</p><p>Many slaves in cities could raise, &quot;by hook or by crook,&quot; fifty or one hundred dollars to pay for a passage, providing they could find one who was willing to risk aiding them. Thus, while the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia especially neither charged nor accepted anything for their services, it was not to be expected that any of the Southern agents could afford to do likewise.</p><p>The husband of Mary had for a long time wanted his own freedom, but did not feel that he could go without his wife; in fact, he resolved to get her off first, then to try and escape himself, if possible. The first essential step towards success, he considered, was to save his money and make it an object to the captain to help him. So when he had managed to lay by one hundred dollars, he willingly offered this sum to Captain B., if he would engage to deliver his wife into the hands of the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia. The captain agreed to the terms and fulfilled his engagement to the letter. About the 1st of March, 1855, Mary was presented to the Vigilance Committee. She was of agreeable manners, about forty-five years of age, dark complexion, round built, and intelligent. She had been the mother of fifteen children, four of whom had been sold away from her; one was still held in slavery in Petersburg; the others were all dead.</p><p>At the sale of one of her children she was so affected with grief that she was thrown into violent convulsions, which caused the loss of her speech for one entire month. But this little episode was not a matter to excite sympathy in the breasts of the highly refined and tender-hearted Christian mothers of Petersburg. In the mercy of Providence, however, her reason and strength returned.</p><p>She had formerly belonged to the late Littleton Reeves, whom she represented as having been &quot;kind&quot; to her, much more so than her mistress (Mrs. Reeves). Said Mary, &quot;She being of a jealous disposition, caused me to be hired out with a hard family, where I was much abused, frequently flogged, and stinted for food,&quot; etc.</p><p>But the sweets of freedom in the care of the Vigilance Committee now delighted her mind, and the hope that her husband would soon follow her to Canada, inspired her with expectations that she would one day &quot;sit under her own vine and fig tree where none dared to molest or make her afraid.&quot;</p><p>The Committee rendered her the usual assistance, and in due time, forwarded her on to Queen Victoria&#39;s free land in Canada. On her arrival she wrote back as follows--</p><pre><code>TORONTO, March 14th, 1855.

EMMA BROWN (old name MARY EPPS).
</code></pre><p>Now, Joseph and Robert (Mary&#39;s associate passengers from Richmond) must here be noticed. Joseph was of a dark orange color, medium size, very active and intelligent, and doubtless, well understood the art of behaving himself. He was well acquainted with the auction block--having been sold three times, and had had the misfortune to fall into the hands of a cruel master each time. Under these circumstances he had had but few privileges. Sundays and week days alike he was kept pretty severely bent down to duty. He had been beaten and knocked around shamefully. He had a wife, and spoke of her in most endearing language, although, on leaving, he did not feel at liberty to apprise her of his movements, &quot;fearing that it would not be safe so to do.&quot; His four little children, to whom he appeared warmly attached, he left as he did his wife--in Slavery. He declared that he &quot;stuck to them as long as he could.&quot; George E. Sadler, the keeper of an oyster house, held the deed for &quot;Joe,&quot; and a most heartless wretch he was in Joe&#39;s estimation. The truth was, Joe could not stand the burdens and abuses which Sadler was inclined to heap upon him. So he concluded to join his brother and go off on the U.G.R.R.</p><p>Robert, his younger brother, was owned by Robert Slater, Esq., a regular negro trader. Eight years this slave&#39;s duties had been at the slave prison, and among other daily offices he had to attend to, was to lock up the prison, prepare the slaves for sale, etc. Robert was a very intelligent young man, and from long and daily experience with the customs and usages of the slave prison, he was as familiar with the business as a Pennsylvania farmer with his barn-yard stock. His account of things was too harrowing for detail here, except in the briefest manner, and that only with reference to a few particulars. In order to prepare slaves for the market, it was usual to have them greased and rubbed to make them look bright and shining. And he went on further to state, that &quot;females as well as males were not uncommonly stripped naked, lashed flat to a bench, and then held by two men, sometimes four, while the brutal trader would strap them with a broad leather strap.&quot; The strap being preferred to the cow-hide, as it would not break the skin, and damage the sale. &quot;One hundred lashes would only be a common flogging.&quot; The separation of families was thought nothing of. &quot;Often I have been flogged for refusing to flog others.&quot; While not yet twenty-three years of age, Robert expressed himself as having become so daily sick of the brutality and suffering he could not help witnessing, that he felt he could not possibly stand it any longer, let the cost be what it might. In this state of mind he met with Captain B. Only one obstacle stood in his way--material aid. It occurred to Robert that he had frequent access to the money drawer, and often it contained the proceeds of fresh sales of flesh and blood; and he reasoned that if some of that would help him and his brother to freedom, there could be no harm in helping himself the first opportunity.</p><p>The captain was all ready, and provided he could get three passengers at $100 each he would set sail without much other freight. Of course he was too shrewd to get out papers for Philadelphia. That would betray him at once. Washington or Baltimore, or even Wilmington, Del., were names which stood fair in the eyes of Virginia. Consequently, being able to pack the fugitives away in a very private hole of his boat, and being only bound for a Southern port, the captain was willing to risk his share of the danger. &quot;Very well,&quot; said Robert, &quot;to-day I will please my master so well, that I will catch him at an unguarded moment, and will ask him for a pass to go to a ball to-night (slave-holders love to see their slaves fiddling and dancing of nights), and as I shall be leaving in a hurry, I will take a grab from the day&#39;s sale, and when Slater hears of me again, I will be in Canada.&quot; So after having attended to all his disagreeable duties, he made his &quot;grab,&quot; and got a hand full. He did not know, however, how it would hold out. That evening, instead of participating with the gay dancers, he was just one degree lower down than the regular bottom of Captain B&#39;s. deck, with several hundred dollars in his pocket, after paying the worthy captain one hundred each for himself and his brother, besides making the captain an additional present of nearly one hundred. Wind and tide were now what they prayed for to speed on the U.G.R.R. schooner, until they might reach the depot at Philadelphia.</p><p>The Richmond <em>Dispatch</em>, an enterprising paper in the interest of slaveholders, which came daily to the Committee, was received in advance of the passengers, when lo! and behold, in turning to the interesting column containing the elegant illustrations of &quot;runaway negroes,&quot; it was seen that the unfortunate Slater had &quot;lost $1500 in North Carolina money, and also his dark orange-colored, intelligent, and good-looking turnkey, Bob.&quot; &quot;Served him right, it is no stealing for one piece of property to go off with another piece,&quot; reasoned a member of the Committee.</p><p>In a couple of days after the Dispatch brought the news, the three U.G.R.R. passengers were safely landed at the usual place, and so accurate were the descriptions in the paper, that, on first seeing them, the Committee recognized them instantly, and, without any previous ceremonies, read to them the advertisement relative to the &quot;$1500 in N.C. money, &amp;c.,&quot; and put the question to them direct: &quot;Are you the ones?&quot; &quot;We are,&quot; they owned up without hesitation. The Committee did not see a dollar of their money, but understood they had about $900, after paying the captain; while Bob considered he made a &quot;very good grab,&quot; he did not admit that the amount advertised was correct.

have just got, it had been opened before it came to me. I have
not received any other letter from you and can get no account of
them in the Post Office in this place, I am well and have got a
good situation in this city and intend staying here. I should be
very glad to hear from you as soon as convenient and also from
all of my friends near you. My Brother is also at work with me
and doing well.

There is nothing here that would interest you in the way of
news. There is a Masonic Lodge of our people and two churches
and societys here and some other institutions for our benefit.
Be kind enough to send a few lines to the Lady spoken of for
that mocking bird and much oblige me. Write me soon and believe
me your obedient Serv&#39;t

Love &amp; respects to Lady and daughter

</code></pre><p>As well as writing to a member of the Committee, Joe and Bob had the assurance to write back to the trader and oyster-house keeper. In their letter they stated that they had arrived safely in Canada, and were having good times,--in the eating line had an abundance of the best,--also had very choice wines and brandies, which they supposed that they (trader and oyster-house keeper) would give a great deal to have a &quot;smack at.&quot; And then they gave them a very cordial invitation to make them a visit, and suggested that the quickest way they could come, would be by telegraph, which they admitted was slightly dangerous, and without first greasing themselves, and then hanging on very fast, the journey might not prove altogether advantageous to them. This was wormwood and gall to the trader and oyster-house man. A most remarkable coincidence was that, about the time this letter was received in Richmond, the captain who brought away the three passengers, made it his business for some reason or other, to call at the oyster-house kept by the owner of Joe, and while there, this letter was read and commented on in torrents of Billingsgate phrases; and the trader told the captain that he would give him &quot;two thousand dollars if he would get them;&quot; finally he told him he would &quot;give every cent they would bring, which would be much over $2000,&quot; as they were &quot;so very likely.&quot; How far the captain talked approvingly, he did not exactly tell the Committee, but they guessed he talked strong Democratic doctrine to them under the frightful circumstances. But he was good at concealing his feelings, and obviously managed to avoid suspicion.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Nothing remarkable was discovered in their stories of slave life; their narratives will therefore be brief.</p><p>George Solomon was owned by Daniel Minor, of Moss Grove, Va. George was about thirty-three years of age; mulatto, intelligent, and of prepossessing appearance. His old master valued George&#39;s services very highly, and had often declared to others, as well as to George himself, that without him he should hardly know how to manage. And frequently George was told by the old master that at his &quot;death he was not to be a slave any longer, as he would have provision made in his will for his freedom.&quot; For a long time this old story was clung to pretty faithfully by George, but his &quot;old master hung on too long,&quot; consequently George&#39;s patience became exhausted. And as he had heard a good deal about Canada, U.G.R.R., and the Abolitionists, he concluded that it would do no harm to hint to a reliable friend or two the names of these hard places and bad people, to see what impression would be made on their minds; in short, to see if they were ready to second a motion to get rid of bondage. In thus opening his mind to his friends, he soon found a willing accord in each of their hearts, and they put their heads together to count up the cost and to fix a time for leaving Egypt and the host of Pharaoh to do their own &quot;hewing of wood and drawing of water.&quot; Accordingly George, Daniel, Benjamin and Maria, all of one heart and mind, one &quot;Saturday night&quot; resolved that the next Sunday should find them on the U.G.R.R., with their faces towards Canada.</p><p>Daniel was young, only twenty-three, good looking, and half white, with a fair share of intelligence. As regards his slave life, he acknowledged that he had not had it very rough as a general thing; nevertheless, he was fully persuaded that he had &quot;as good a right to his freedom&quot; as his &quot;master had to his,&quot; and that it was his duty to contend for it.</p><p>Benjamin was twenty-seven years of age, small of stature, dark complexion, of a pleasant countenance, and quite smart. He testified, that &quot;ill-treatment from his master,&quot; Henry Martin, who would give him &quot;no chance at all,&quot; was the cause of his leaving. He left a brother and sister, belonging to Martin, besides he left two other sisters in bondage, Louisa and Letty, but his father and mother were both dead. Therefore, the land of slave-whips and auction-blocks had no charms for him. He loved his sisters, but he knew if he could not protect himself, much less could he protect them. So he concluded to bid them adieu forever in this world.</p><p>Turning from the three male companions for the purpose of finding a brief space for Maria, it will be well to state here that females in attempting to escape from a life of bondage undertook three times the risk of failure that males were liable to, not to mention the additional trials and struggles they had to contend with. In justice, therefore, to the heroic female who was willing to endure the most extreme suffering and hardship for freedom, double honors were due.</p><p>Maria, the heroine of the party, was about forty years of age, chestnut color, medium size, and possessed of a good share of common sense. She was owned by George Parker. As was a common thing with slave-holders, Maria had found her owners hard to please, and quite often, without the slightest reason, they would threaten to &quot;sell or make a change.&quot; These threats only made matters worse, or rather it only served to nerve Maria for the conflict. The party walked almost the entire distance from Washington to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</p><p>In the meantime George Parker, the so-called owner of Daniel and Maria, hurriedly rushed their good names into the &quot;Baltimore Sun,&quot; after the following manner--</p><pre><code>&quot;FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ranaway from my house on Saturday

</code></pre><p>HENRY BOX BROWN.</p><p>ARRIVED BY ADAMS&#39; EXPRESS.</p><p>Although the name of Henry Box Brown has been echoed over the land for a number of years, and the simple facts connected with his marvelous escape from slavery in a box published widely through the medium of anti-slavery papers, nevertheless it is not unreasonable to suppose that very little is generally known in relation to this case.</p><p>Briefly, the facts are these, which doubtless have never before been fully published--</p><p>Brown was a man of invention as well as a hero. In point of interest, however, his case is no more remarkable than many others. Indeed, neither before nor after escaping did he suffer one-half what many others have experienced.</p><p>He was decidedly an unhappy piece of property in the city of Richmond, Va. In the condition of a slave he felt that it would be impossible for him to remain. Full well did he know, however, that it was no holiday task to escape the vigilance of Virginia slave-hunters, or the wrath of an enraged master for committing the unpardonable sin of attempting to escape to a land of liberty. So Brown counted well the cost before venturing upon this hazardous undertaking. Ordinary modes of travel he concluded might prove disastrous to his hopes; he, therefore, hit upon a new invention altogether, which was to have himself boxed up and forwarded to Philadelphia direct by express. The size of the box and how it was to be made to fit him most comfortably, was of his own ordering. Two feet eight inches deep, two feet wide, and three feet long were the exact dimensions of the box, lined with baize. His resources with regard to food and water consisted of the following: One bladder of water and a few small biscuits. His mechanical implement to meet the death-struggle for fresh air, all told, was one large gimlet. Satisfied that it would be far better to peril his life for freedom in this way than to remain under the galling yoke of Slavery, he entered his box, which was safely nailed up and hooped with five hickory hoops, and was then addressed by his next friend, James A. Smith, a shoe dealer, to Wm. H. Johnson, Arch street, Philadelphia, marked, &quot;This side up with care.&quot; In this condition he was sent to Adams&#39; Express office in a dray, and thence by overland express to Philadelphia. It was twenty-six hours from the time he left Richmond until his arrival in the City of Brotherly Love. The notice, &quot;This side up, &amp;c.,&quot; did not avail with the different expressmen, who hesitated not to handle the box in the usual rough manner common to this class of men. For a while they actually had the box upside down, and had him on his head for miles. A few days before he was expected, certain intimation was conveyed to a member of the Vigilance Committee that a box might be expected by the three o&#39;clock morning train from the South, which might contain a man. One of the most serious walks he ever took--and they had not been a few--to meet and accompany passengers, he took at half past two o&#39;clock that morning to the depot. Not once, but for more than a score of times, he fancied the slave would be dead. He anxiously looked while the freight was being unloaded from the cars, to see if he could recognize a box that might contain a man; one alone had that appearance, and he confessed it really seemed as if there was the scent of death about it. But on inquiry, he soon learned that it was not the one he was looking after, and he was free to say he experienced a marked sense of relief. That same afternoon, however, he received from Richmond a telegram, which read thus, &quot;Your case of goods is shipped and will arrive to-morrow morning.&quot;</p><p>At this exciting juncture of affairs, Mr. McKim, who had been engineering this important undertaking, deemed it expedient to change the programme slightly in one particular at least to insure greater safety. Instead of having a member of the Committee go again to the depot for the box, which might excite suspicion, it was decided that it would be safest to have the express bring it direct to the Anti-Slavery Office.</p><p>But all apprehension of danger did not now disappear, for there was no room to suppose that Adams&#39; Express office had any sympathy with the Abolitionist or the fugitive, consequently for Mr. McKim to appear personally at the express office to give directions with reference to the coming of a box from Richmond which would be directed to Arch street, and yet not intended for that street, but for the Anti-Slavery office at 107 North Fifth street, it needed of course no great discernment to foresee that a step of this kind was wholly impracticable and that a more indirect and covert method would have to be adopted. In this dreadful crisis Mr. McKim, with his usual good judgment and remarkably quick, strategical mind, especially in matters pertaining to the U.G.R.R., hit upon the following plan, namely, to go to his friend, E.M. Davis,[A] who was then extensively engaged in mercantile business, and relate the circumstances. Having daily intercourse with said Adams&#39; Express office, and being well acquainted with the firm and some of the drivers, Mr. Davis could, as Mr. McKim thought, talk about &quot;boxes, freight, etc.,&quot; from any part of the country without risk. Mr. Davis heard Mr. McKim&#39;s plan and instantly approved of it, and was heartily at his service.</p><p>[Footnote A: E.M. Davis was a member of the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and a long-tried Abolitionist, son-in-law of James and Lucretia Mott.]</p><p>[Illustration: RESURRECTION OF HENRY BOX BROWN.]</p><p>&quot;Dan, an Irishman, one of Adams&#39; Express drivers, is just the fellow to go to the depot after the box,&quot; said Davis. &quot;He drinks a little too much whiskey sometimes, but he will do anything I ask him to do, promptly and obligingly. I&#39;ll trust Dan, for I believe he is the very man.&quot; The difficulty which Mr. McKim had been so anxious to overcome was thus pretty well settled. It was agreed that Dan should go after the box next morning before daylight and bring it to the Anti-Slavery office direct, and to make it all the more agreeable for Dan to get up out of his warm bed and go on this errand before day, it was decided that he should have a five dollar gold piece for himself. Thus these preliminaries having been satisfactorily arranged, it only remained for Mr. Davis to see Dan and give him instructions accordingly, etc.</p><p>Next morning, according to arrangement, the box was at the Anti-Slavery office in due time. The witnesses present to behold the resurrection were J.M. McKim, Professor C.D. Cleveland, Lewis Thompson, and the writer.</p><p>Mr. McKim was deeply interested; but having been long identified with the Anti-Slavery cause as one of its oldest and ablest advocates in the darkest days of slavery and mobs, and always found by the side of the fugitive to counsel and succor, he was on this occasion perfectly composed.</p><p>Professor Cleveland, however, was greatly moved. His zeal and earnestness in the cause of freedom, especially in rendering aid to passengers, knew no limit. Ordinarily he could not too often visit these travelers, shake them too warmly by the hand, or impart to them too freely of his substance to aid them on their journey. But now his emotion was overpowering.</p><p>Mr. Thompson, of the firm of Merrihew &amp; Thompson--about the only printers in the city who for many years dared to print such incendiary documents as anti-slavery papers and pamphlets--one of the truest friends of the slave, was composed and prepared to witness the scene.</p><p>All was quiet. The door had been safely locked. The proceedings commenced. Mr. McKim rapped quietly on the lid of the box and called out, &quot;All right!&quot; Instantly came the answer from within, &quot;All right, sir!&quot;</p><p>The witnesses will never forget that moment. Saw and hatchet quickly had the five hickory hoops cut and the lid off, and the marvellous resurrection of Brown ensued. Rising up in his box, he reached out his hand, saying, &quot;How do you do, gentlemen?&quot; The little assemblage hardly knew what to think or do at the moment. He was about as wet as if he had come up out of the Delaware. Very soon he remarked that, before leaving Richmond he had selected for his arrival-hymn (if he lived) the Psalm beginning with these words: &quot;<em>I waited patiently for the Lord, and He heard my prayer</em>.&quot; And most touchingly did he sing the psalm, much to his own relief, as well as to the delight of his small audience.</p><p>He was then christened Henry Box Brown, and soon afterwards was sent to the hospitable residence of James Mott and E.M. Davis, on Ninth street, where, it is needless to say, he met a most cordial reception from Mrs. Lucretia Mott and her household. Clothing and creature comforts were furnished in abundance, and delight and joy filled all hearts in that stronghold of philanthropy.</p><p>As he had been so long doubled up in the box he needed to promenade considerably in the fresh air, so James Mott put one of his broad-brim hats on his head and tendered him the hospitalities of his yard as well as his house, and while Brown promenaded the yard flushed with victory, great was the joy of his friends.</p><p>After his visit at Mr. Mott&#39;s, he spent two days with the writer, and then took his departure for Boston, evidently feeling quite conscious of the wonderful feat he had performed, and at the same time it may be safely said that those who witnessed this strange resurrection were not only elated at his success, but were made to sympathize more deeply than ever before with the slave. Also the noble-hearted Smith who boxed him up was made to rejoice over Brown&#39;s victory, and was thereby encouraged to render similar service to two other young bondmen, who appealed to him for deliverance. But, unfortunately, in this attempt the undertaking proved a failure. Two boxes containing the young men alluded to above, after having been duly expressed and some distance on the road, were, through the agency of the telegraph, betrayed, and the heroic young fugitives were captured in their boxes and dragged back to hopeless bondage. Consequently, through this deplorable failure, Samuel A. Smith was arrested, imprisoned, and was called upon to suffer severely, as may be seen from the subjoined correspondence, taken from the New York Tribune soon after his release from the penitentiary.</p><p>THE DELIVERER OF BOX BROWN--MEETING OF THE COLORED CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA.</p><pre><code>[Correspondence of the N.Y. Tribune.]

PHILADELPHIA, Saturday, July 5, 1856.

Samuel A. Smith, who boxed up Henry Box Brown in Richmond, Va.,
and forwarded him by overland express to Philadelphia, and who
was arrested and convicted, eight years ago, for boxing up two
other slaves, also directed to Philadelphia, having served out
his imprisonment in the Penitentiary, was released on the 18th
ultimo, and arrived in this city on the 21st.

Though he lost all his property; though he was refused witnesses
on his trial (no officer could be found, who would serve a
summons on a witness); though for five long months, in hot
weather, he was kept heavily chained in a cell four by eight
feet in dimensions; though he received five dreadful stabs,
aimed at his heart, by a bribed assassin, nevertheless he still
rejoices in the motives which prompted him to &quot;undo the heavy
burdens, and let the oppressed go free.&quot; Having resided nearly
all his life in the South, where he had traveled and seen much
of the &quot;peculiar institution,&quot; and had witnessed the most horrid
enormities inflicted upon the slave, whose cries were ever
ringing in his ears, and for whom he had the warmest sympathy,
Mr. Smith could not refrain from believing that the black man,
as well as the white, had God-given rights. Consequently, he was
not accustomed to shed tears when a poor creature escaped ftom
his &quot;kind master;&quot; nor was he willing to turn a deaf ear to his
appeals and groans, when he knew he was thirsting for freedom.
From 1828 up to the day he was incarcerated, many had sought his
aid and counsel, nor had they sought in vain. In various places
he operated with success. In Richmond, however, it seemed
expedient to invent a new plan for certain emergencies, hence
the Box and Express plan was devised, at the instance of a few
heroic slaves, who had manifested their willingness to die in a
box, on the road to liberty, rather than continue longer under
the yoke. But these heroes fell into the power of their enemies.
Mr. Smith had not been long in the Penitentiary before he had
fully gained the esteem and confidence of the Superintendent and
other officers. Finding him to be humane and
generous-hearted--showing kindness toward all, especially in
buying bread, &amp;c., for the starving prisoners, and by a timely
note of warning, which had saved the life of one of the keepers,
for whose destruction a bold plot had been arranged--the
officers felt disposed to show him such favors as the law would
allow. But their good intentions were soon frustrated. The
Inquisition (commonly called the Legislature), being in session
in Richmond, hearing that the Superintendent had been speaking
well of Smith, and circulating a petition for his pardon,
indignantly demanded to know if the rumor was well founded. Two
weeks were spent by the Inquisition, and many witnesses were
placed upon oath, to solemnly testify in the matter. One of the
keepers swore that his life had been saved by Smith. Col.
Morgan, the Superintendent, frequently testified in writing and
verbally to Smith&#39;s good deportment; acknowledging that he had
circulated petitions, &amp;c.; and took the position, that he
sincerely believed, that it would be to the interest of the
institution to pardon him; calling the attention of the
Inquisition, at the same time, to the fact, that not
unfrequently pardons had been granted to criminals, under
sentence of death, for the most cold-blooded murder, to say
nothing of other gross crimes. The effort for pardon was soon
abandoned, for the following reason given by the Governor: &quot;I
can&#39;t, and I won&#39;t pardon him!&quot;

In view of the unparalleled injustice which Mr. S. had suffered,
as well as on account of the aid he had rendered to the slaves,
on his arrival in this city the colored citizens of Philadelphia
felt that he was entitled to sympathy and aid, and straightway
invited him to remain a few days, until arrangements could be
made for a mass meeting to receive him. Accordingly, on last
Monday evening, a mass meeting convened in the Israel church,
and the Rev. Wm. T. Catto was called to the chair, and Wm. Still
was appointed secretary. The chairman briefly stated the object
of the meeting. Having lived in the South, he claimed to know
something of the workings of the oppressive system of slavery
generally, and declared that, notwithstanding the many exposures
of the evil which came under his own observation, the most vivid
descriptions fell far short of the realities his own eyes had
witnessed. He then introduced Mr. Smith, who arose and in a
plain manner briefly told his story, assuring the audience that
he had always hated slavery, and had taken great pleasure in
helping many out of it, and though he had suffered much
physically and pecuniarily for the cause&#39; sake, yet he murmured
not, but rejoiced in what he had done. After taking his seat,
addresses were made by the Rev. S. Smith, Messrs. Kinnard,
Brunner, Bradway, and others. The following preamble and
resolutions were adopted--


    WHEREAS, We, the colored citizens of Philadelphia, have
    among us Samuel A. Smith, who was incarcerated over
    seven years in the Richmond Penitentiary, for doing an
    act that was honorable to his feelings and his sense of
    justice and humanity, therefore,

    _Resolved_, That we welcome him to this city as a martyr
    to the cause of Freedom.

    _Resolved_, That we heartily tender him our gratitude
    for the good he has done to our suffering race.

    _Resolved_, That we sympathize with him in his losses
    and sufferings in the cause of the poor, down-trodden
    slave.

    W.S.
</code></pre><p>During his stay in Philadelphia, on this occasion, he stopped for about a fortnight with the writer, and it was most gratifying to learn from him that he was no new worker on the U.G.R.R. But that he had long hated slavery thoroughly, and although surrounded with perils on every side, he had not failed to help a poor slave whenever the opportunity was presented.</p><p>Pecuniary aid, to some extent, was rendered him in this city, for which he was grateful, and after being united in marriage, by Wm. H. Furness, D.D., to a lady who had remained faithful to him through all his sore trials and sufferings, he took his departure for Western New York, with a good conscience and an unshaken faith in the belief that in aiding his fellow-man to freedom he had but simply obeyed the word of Him who taught man to do unto others as he would be done by.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Consequently they avoided bringing slaves beyond Mason and Dixon&#39;s Line in traveling North. But some slave-holders were not thus mindful of the laws, or were too arrogant to take heed, as may be seen in the case of Colonel John H. Wheeler, of North Carolina, the United States Minister to Nicaragua. In passing through Philadelphia from Washington, one very warm July day in 1855, accompanied by three of his slaves, his high official equilibrium, as well as his assumed rights under the Constitution, received a terrible shock at the hands of the Committee. Therefore, for the readers of these pages, and in order to completely illustrate the various phases of the work of the Committee in the days of Slavery, this case, selected from many others, is a fitting one.

PHILADELPHIA, Monday, July 30, 1855.

As the public have not been made acquainted with the facts and
particulars respecting the agency of Mr. Passmore Williamson and
others, in relation to the slave case now agitating this city,
and especially as the poor slave mother and her two sons have
been so grossly misrepresented, I deem it my duty to lay the
facts before you, for publication or otherwise, as you may think
proper.

On Wednesday afternoon, week, at 4-1/2 o&#39;clock, the following
note was placed in my hands by a colored boy whom I had never
before seen, to my recollection:

&quot;MR. STILL--_Sir_: Will you come down to Bloodgood&#39;s Hotel as
soon as possible--as there are three fugitive slaves here and
they want liberty. Their master is here with them, on his way to
New York.&quot;

The note was without date, and the signature so indistinctly
written as not to be understood by me, having evidently been
penned in a moment of haste.

Without delay I ran with the note to Mr. P. Williamson&#39;s office,
Seventh and Arch, found him at his desk, and gave it to him, and
after reading it, he remarked that he could not go down, as he
had to go to Harrisburg that night on business--but he advised
me to go, and to get the names of the slave-holder and the
slaves, in order to telegraph to New York to have them arrested
there, as no time remained to procure a writ of habeas corpus
here.

I could not have been two minutes in Mr. W.&#39;s office before
starting in haste for the wharf. To my surprise, however, when I
reached the wharf, there I found Mr. W., his mind having
undergone a sudden change; he was soon on the spot.

I saw three or four colored persons in the hall at Bloodgood&#39;s,
none of whom I recognized except the boy who brought me the
note. Before having time for making inquiry some one said they
had gone on board the boat. &quot;Get their description,&quot; said Mr. W.
I instantly inquired of one of the colored persons for the
desired description, and was told that she was &quot;a tall, dark
woman, with two little boys.&quot;

Mr. W. and myself ran on board of the boat, looked among the
passengers on the first deck, but saw them not. &quot;They are up on
the second deck,&quot; an unknown voice uttered. In a second we were
in their presence. We approached the anxious-looking
slave-mother with her two boys on her left-hand; close on her
right sat an ill-favored white man having a cane in his hand
which I took to be a sword-cane. (As to its being a sword-cane,
however, I might have been mistaken.)

The first words to the mother were: &quot;Are you traveling?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot;
was the prompt answer. &quot;With whom?&quot; She nodded her head toward
the ill-favored man, signifying with him. Fidgeting on his seat,
he said something, exactly what I do not now recollect. In reply
I remarked: &quot;Do they belong to you, Sir?&quot; &quot;Yes, they are in my
charge,&quot; was his answer. Turning from him to the mother and her
sons, in substance, and word for word, as near as I can
remember, the following remarks were earnestly though calmly
addressed by the individuals who rejoiced to meet them on free
soil, and who felt unmistakably assured that they were justified
by the laws of Pennsylvania as well as the Law of God, in
informing them of their rights:

&quot;You are entitled to your freedom according to the laws of
Pennsylvania, having been brought into the State by your owner.
If you prefer freedom to slavery, as we suppose everybody does,
you have the chance to accept it now. Act calmly--don&#39;t be
frightened by your master--you are as much entitled to your
freedom as we are, or as he is--be determined and you need have
no fears but that you will be protected by the law. Judges have
time and again decided cases in this city and State similar to
yours in favor of freedom! Of course, if you want to remain a
slave with your master, we cannot force you to leave; we only
want to make you sensible of your rights. _Remember, if you lose
this chance you may never get such another,&quot; etc_.

[Illustration: RESCUE OF JANE JOHNSON AND HER CHILDREN.]

This advice to the woman was made in the hearing of a number of
persons present, white and colored; and one elderly white
gentleman of genteel address, who seemed to take much interest
in what was going on, remarked that they would have the same
chance for their freedom in New Jersey and New York as they then
had--seeming to sympathize with the woman, etc.

During the few moments in which the above remarks were made, the
slaveholder frequently interrupted--said she understood all
about the laws making her free, and her right to leave if she
wanted to; but contended that she did not want to leave--that
she was on a visit to New York to see her friends--afterward
_wished to return to her three children whom she left in
Virginia, from whom it would be_ HARD _to separate her_.
Furthermore, he diligently tried to constrain her to say that
she did not want to be interfered with--that she wanted to go
with him--that she was on a visit to New York--had children in
the South, etc.; but the woman&#39;s desire to be free was
altogether too strong to allow her to make a single
acknowledgment favorable to his wishes in the matter. On the
contrary, she repeatedly said, distinctly and firmly, &quot;_I am not
free, but I want my freedom_--ALWAYS _wanted to be free!! but he
holds me_.&quot;

While the slaveholder claimed that she belonged to him, he said
_that she was free_! Again he said that he was _going to give
her her freedom_, etc. When his eyes would be off of hers, such
eagerness as her looks expressed, indicative of her entreaty
that we would not forsake her and her little ones in their
weakness, it had never been my lot to witness before, under any
circumstances.

The last bell tolled! The last moment for further delay passed!
The arm of the woman being slightly touched, accompanied with
the word, &quot;Come!&quot; she instantly arose. &quot;Go along--go along!&quot;
said some, who sympathized, to the boys, at the same time taking
hold of their arms. By this time the parties were fairly moving
toward the stairway leading to the deck below. Instantly on
their starting, the slave-holder rushed at the woman and her
children, to prevent their leaving; and, if I am not mistaken,
he simultaneously took hold of the woman and Mr. Williamson,
which resistance on his part caused Mr. W. to take hold of him
and set him aside quickly.

The passengers were looking on all around, but none interfered
in behalf of the slaveholder except one man, whom I took to be
another slaveholder. He said harshly, &quot;Let them alone; they are
his _property_!&#39;&quot; The youngest boy, about 7 years of age--too
young to know what these things meant--cried &quot;Massa John! Massa
John!&quot; The elder boy, 11 years of age, took the matter more
dispassionately, and the mother _quite calmly_. The mother and
her sympathizers all moved down the stairs together in the
presence of quite a number of spectators on the first deck and
on the wharf, all of whom, as far as I was able to discern,
seemed to look upon the whole affair with the greatest
indifference. The woman and children were assisted, but not
forced to leave. Nor were there any violence or threatenings as
I saw or heard. The only words that I heard from any one of an
objectionable character, were: &quot;Knock him down; knock him down!&quot;
but who uttered it or who was meant I knew not, nor have I since
been informed. However, if it was uttered by a colored man, I
regret it, as there was not the slightest cause for such
language, especially as the sympathies of the spectators and
citizens seemed to justify the course pursued.

While passing off of the wharf and down Delaware-avenue to Dock
st., and up Dock to Front, where a carriage was procured, the
slaveholder and one police officer were of the party, if no
more.

The youngest boy on being put in the carriage was told that he
was &quot;a fool for crying so after &#39;Massa John,&#39; who would sell him
if he ever caught him.&quot; Not another whine was heard on the
subject.

The carriage drove down town slowly, the horses being fatigued
and the weather intensely hot; the inmates were put out on Tenth
street--not at any house--after which they soon found hospitable
friends and quietude. The excitement of the moment having passed
by, the mother _seemed very cheerful, and rejoiced greatly that
herself and boys had been, as she thought, so &quot;providentially
delivered from the house of bondage_!&quot; For the first time in her
life she could look upon herself and children and feel free!

Having felt the iron in her heart for the best half of her
days--having been sold with her children on the auction
block--having had one of her children sold far away from her
without hope of her seeing him again--she very naturally and
wisely concluded to go to Canada, fearing if she remained in
this city--as some assured her she could do with entire
safety--that she might again find herself in the clutches of the
tyrant from whom she had fled.

A few items of what she related concerning the character of her
master may be interesting to the reader--

Within the last two years he had sold all his slaves--between
thirty and forty in number--having purchased the present ones in
that space of time. She said that before leaving Washington,
coming on the cars, and at his father-in-law&#39;s in this city, a
number of persons had told him that in bringing his slaves into
Pennsylvania they would be free. When told at his
father-in-law&#39;s, as she overheard it, that he &quot;could not have
done a worse thing,&quot; &amp;c., he replied that &quot;Jane would not leave
him.&quot;

As much, however, as he affected to have such implicit
confidence in Jane, he scarcely allowed her to be out of his
presence a moment while in this city. To use Jane&#39;s own
language, he was &quot;on her heels every minute,&quot; fearing that some
one might get to her ears the sweet music of freedom. By the
way, Jane had it deep in her heart before leaving the South, and
was bent on succeeding in New York, if disappointed in
Philadelphia.

At Bloodgood&#39;s, after having been belated and left by the 2
o&#39;clock train, while waiting for the 5 o&#39;clock line, his
appetite tempted her &quot;master&quot; to take a hasty dinner. So after
placing Jane where he thought she would be pretty secure from
&quot;evil communications&quot; from the colored waiters, and after giving
her a double counselling, he made his way to the table; remained
but a little while, however, before leaving to look after Jane;
finding her composed, looking over a bannister near where he
left her, he returned to the table again and finished his meal.

But, alas, for the slave-holder! Jane had her &quot;top eye open,&quot;
and in that brief space had appealed to the sympathies of a
person whom she ventured to trust, saying, &quot;I and my children
are slaves, and we want liberty!&quot; I am not certain, but suppose
that person, in the goodness of his heart, was the cause of the
note being sent to the Anti-Slavery office, and hence the
result.

As to her going on to New York to see her friends, and wishing
to return to her three children in the South, and his going to
free her, &amp;c., Jane declared repeatedly and very positively,
that there was not a particle of truth in what her master said
on these points. The truth is she had not the slightest hope of
freedom through any act of his. She had only left one boy in the
South, who had been sold far away, where she scarcely ever heard
from him, indeed never expected to see him any more.

In appearance Jane is tall and well formed, high and large
forehead, of genteel manners, chestnut color, and seems to
possess, naturally, uncommon good sense, though of course she
has never been allowed to read.

Thus I have given as truthful a report as I am capable of doing,
of Jane and the circumstances connected with her deliverance.

W. STILL.

P.S.--Of the five colored porters who promptly appeared, with
warm hearts throbbing in sympathy with the mother and her
children, too much cannot be said in commendation. In the
present case they acted nobly, whatever may be said of their
general character, of which I know nothing. How human beings,
who have ever tasted oppression, could have acted differently
under the circumstances I cannot conceive.
</code></pre><p>The mystery alluded to, which the above letter did not contain, and which the court failed to make Mr. Williamson reveal, might have been truthfully explained in these words. The carriage was procured at the wharf, while Col. Wheeler and Mr. Williamson were debating the question relative to the action of the Committee, and at that instant, Jane and her two boys were invited into it and accompanied by the writer, who procured it, were driven down town, and on Tenth Street, below Lombard, the inmates were invited out of it, and the said conductor paid the driver and discharged him. For prudential reasons he took them to a temporary resting-place, where they could tarry until after dark; then they were invited to his own residence, where they were made welcome, and in due time forwarded East. Now, what disposition was made of them after they had left the wharf, while Williamson and Wheeler were discussing matters--(as was clearly sworn to by Passmore, in his answer to the writ of Habeas Corpus)--he Williamson did not know. That evening, before seeing the member of the Committee, with whom he acted in concert on the boat, and who had entire charge of Jane and her boys, he left for Harrisburg, to fulfill business engagements. The next morning his father (Thomas Williamson) brought the writ of Habeas Corpus (which had been served at Passmore&#39;s office after he left) to the Anti-Slavery Office. In his calm manner he handed it to the writer, at the same time remarking that &quot;Passmore had gone to Harrisburg,&quot; and added, &quot;thee had better attend to it&quot; (the writ). Edward Hopper, Esq., was applied to with the writ, and in the absence of Mr. Williamson, appeared before the court, and stated &quot;that the writ had not been served, as Mr. W. was out of town,&quot; etc.</p><p>After this statement, the Judge postponed further action until the next day. In the meanwhile, Mr. Williamson returned and found the writ awaiting him, and an agitated state of feeling throughout the city besides. Now it is very certain, that he did not seek to know from those in the secret, where Jane Johnson and her boys were taken after they left the wharf, or as to what disposition had been made of them, in any way; except to ask simply, &quot;are they safe?&quot; (and when told &quot;yes,&quot; he smiled) consequently, he might have been examined for a week, by the most skillful lawyer, at the Philadelphia bar, but he could not have answered other than he did in making his return to the writ, before Judge Kane, namely: &quot;<em>That the persons named in the writ, nor either of them, are now nor was at the time of issuing of the writ, or the original writ, or at any other time in the custody, power, or possession of the respondent, nor by him confined or restrained; wherefore he cannot have the bodies,&quot; etc.</em>.</p><p>Thus, while Mr. W. was subjected to the severest trial of his devotion to Freedom, his noble bearing throughout, won for him the admiration and sympathy of the friends of humanity and liberty throughout the entire land, and in proof of his fidelity, he most cheerfully submitted to imprisonment rather than desert his principles. But the truth was not wanted in this instance by the enemies of Freedom; obedience to Slavery was demanded to satisfy the South. The opportunity seemed favorable for teaching abolitionists and negroes, that they had no right to interfere with a &quot;chivalrous southern gentleman,&quot; while passing through Philadelphia with his slaves. Thus, to make an effective blow, all the pro-slavery elements of Philadelphia were brought into action, and matters looked for a time as though Slavery in this instance would have everything its own way. Passmore was locked up in prison on the flimsy pretext of contempt of court, and true bills were found against him and half a dozen colored men, charging them with &quot;riot,&quot; &quot;forcible abduction,&quot; and &quot;assault and battery,&quot; and there was no lack of hard swearing on the part of Col. Wheeler and his pro-slavery sympathizers in substantiation of these grave charges. But the pro-slaveryites had counted without their host--Passmore would not yield an inch, but stood as firmly by his principles in prison, as he did on the boat. Indeed, it was soon evident, that his resolute course was bringing floods of sympathy from the ablest and best minds throughout the North. On the other hand, the occasion was rapidly awakening thousands daily, who had hitherto manifested little or no interest at all on the subject, to the wrongs of the slave.</p><p>It was soon discovered by the &quot;chivalry&quot; that keeping Mr. Williamson in prison would indirectly greatly aid the cause of Freedom--that every day he remained would make numerous converts to the cause of liberty; that Mr. Williamson was doing ten-fold more in prison for the cause of universal liberty than he could possibly do while pursuing his ordinary vocation.</p><p>With regard to the colored men under bonds, Col. Wheeler and his satellites felt very confident that there was no room for them to escape. They must have had reason so to think, judging from the hard swearing they did, before the committing magistrate. Consequently, in the order of events, while Passmore was still in prison, receiving visits from hosts of friends, and letters of sympathy from all parts of the North, William Still, William Curtis, James P. Braddock, John Ballard, James Martin and Isaiah Moore, were brought into court for trial. The first name on the list in the proceedings of the court was called up first.</p><p>Against this individual, it was pretty well understood by the friends of the slave, that no lack of pains and false swearing would be resorted to on the part of Wheeler and his witnesses, to gain a verdict.</p><p>Mr. McKim and other noted abolitionists managing the defense, were equally alive to the importance of overwhelming the enemy in this particular issue. The Hon. Charles Gibbons, was engaged to defend William Still, and William S. Pierce, Esq., and William B. Birney, Esq., the other five colored defendants.</p><p>In order to make the victory complete, the anti-slavery friends deemed it of the highest importance to have Jane Johnson in court, to face her master, and under oath to sweep away his &quot;refuge of lies,&quot; with regard to her being &quot;abducted,&quot; and her unwillingness to &quot;leave her master,&quot; etc. So Mr. McKim and the friends very privately arranged to have Jane Johnson on hand at the opening of the defense.</p><p>Mrs. Lucretia Mott, Mrs. McKim, Miss Sarah Pugh and Mrs. Plumly, volunteered to accompany this poor slave mother to the court-house and to occupy seats by her side, while she should face her master, and boldly, on oath, contradict all his hard swearing. A better subject for the occasion than Jane, could not have been desired. She entered the court room veiled, and of course was not known by the crowd, as pains had been taken to keep the public in ignorance of the fact, that she was to be brought on to bear witness. So that, at the conclusion of the second witness on the part of the defense, &quot;Jane Johnson&quot; was called for, in a shrill voice. Deliberately, Jane arose and answered, in a lady-like manner to her name, and was then the observed of all observers. Never before had such a scene been witnessed in Philadelphia. It was indescribable. Substantially, her testimony on this occasion, was in keeping with the subjoined affidavit, which was as follows--</p><pre><code>&quot;_State of New York, City and County of New York_.

&quot;Jane Johnson being sworn, makes oath and says--

&quot;My name is Jane--Jane Johnson; I was the slave of Mr. Wheeler
of Washington; he bought me and my two children, about two years
ago, of Mr. Cornelius Crew, of Richmond, Va.; my youngest child
is between six and seven years old, the other between ten and
eleven; I have one other child only, and he is in Richmond; I
have not seen him for about two years; never expect to see him
again; Mr. Wheeler brought me and my two children to
Philadelphia, on the way to Nicaragua, to wait on his wife; I
didn&#39;t want to go without my two children, and he consented to
take them; we came to Philadelphia by the cars; stopped at Mr.
Sully&#39;s, Mr. Wheeler&#39;s father-in-law, a few moments; then went
to the steamboat for New York at 2 o&#39;clock, but were too late;
we went into Bloodgood&#39;s Hotel; Mr. Wheeler went to dinner; Mr.
Wheeler had told me in Washington to have nothing to say to
colored persons, and if any of them spoke to me, to say I was a
free woman traveling with a minister; we staid at Bloodgood&#39;s
till 5 o&#39;clock; Mr. Wheeler kept his eye on me all the time
except when he was at dinner; he left his dinner to come and see
if I was safe, and then went back again; while he was at dinner,
I saw a colored woman and told her I was a slave woman, that my
master had told me not to speak to colored people, and that if
any of them spoke to me to say that I was free; but I am not
free; but I want to be free; she said: &#39;poor thing, I pity you;&#39;
after that I saw a colored man and said the same thing to him,
he said he would telegraph to New York, and two men would meet
me at 9 o&#39;clock and take me with them; after that we went on
board the boat, Mr. Wheeler sat beside me on the deck; I saw a
colored gentleman come on board, he beckoned to me; I nodded my
head, and could not go; Mr. Wheeler was beside me and I was
afraid; a white gentleman then came and said to Mr. Wheeler, &#39;I
want to speak to your servant, and tell her of her rights;&#39; Mr.
Wheeler rose and said, &#39;If you have anything to say, say it to
me--she knows her rights;&#39; the white gentleman asked me if I
wanted to be free; I said &#39;I do, but I belong to this gentleman
and I can&#39;t have it;&#39; he replied, &#39;Yes, you can, come with us,
you are as free as your master, if you want your freedom come
now; if you go back to Washington you may never get it;&#39; I rose
to go, Mr. Wheeler spoke, and said, &#39;I will give you your
freedom,&#39; but he had never promised it before, and I knew he
would never give it to me; the white gentleman held out his hand
and I went toward him; I was ready for the word before it was
given me; I took the children by the hands, who both cried, for
they were frightened, but both stopped when they got on shore; a
colored man carried the little one, I led the other by the hand.
We walked down the street till we got to a hack; nobody forced
me away; nobody pulled me, and nobody led me; I went away of my
own free will; I always wished to be free and meant to be free
when I came North; I hardly expected it in Philadelphia, but I
thought I should get free in New York; I have been comfortable
and happy since I left Mr. Wheeler, and so are the children; I
don&#39;t want to go back; I could have gone in Philadelphia if I
had wanted to; I could go now; but I had rather die than go
back. I wish to make this statement before a magistrate, because
I understand that Mr. Williamson is in prison on my account, and
I hope the truth may be of benefit to him.&quot;

JANE [her X mark.] JOHNSON.
</code></pre><p>It might have been supposed that her honest and straightforward testimony would have been sufficient to cause even the most relentless slaveholder to abandon at once a pursuit so monstrous and utterly hopeless as Wheeler&#39;s was. But although he was sadly confused and put to shame, he hung on to the &quot;lost cause&quot; tenaciously. And his counsel, David Webster, Esq., and the United States District Attorney, Vandyke, completely imbued with the pro-slavery spirit, were equally as unyielding. And thus, with a zeal befitting the most worthy object imaginable, they labored with untiring effort to convict the colored men.</p><p>By this policy, however, the counsel for the defense was doubly aroused. Mr. Gibbons, in the most eloquent and indignant strains, perfectly annihilated the &quot;distinguished Colonel John H. Wheeler, United States Minister Plenipotentiary near the Island of Nicaragua,&quot; taking special pains to ring the changes repeatedly on his long appellations. Mr. Gibbons appeared to be precisely in the right mood to make himself surpassingly forcible and eloquent, on whatever point of law he chose to touch bearing on the case; or in whatever direction he chose to glance at the injustice and cruelty of the South. Most vividly did he draw the contrast between the States of &quot;Georgia&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania,&quot; with regard to the atrocious laws of Georgia. Scarcely less vivid is the impression after a lapse of sixteen years, than when this eloquent speech was made. With the District Attorney, Wm. B. Mann, Esq., and his Honor, Judge Kelley, the defendants had no cause to complain. Throughout the entire proceedings, they had reason to feel, that neither of these officials sympathized in the least with Wheeler or Slavery. Indeed in the Judge&#39;s charge and also in the District Attorney&#39;s closing speech the ring of freedom could be distinctly heard--much more so than was agreeable to Wheeler and his Pro-Slavery sympathizers. The case of Wm. Still ended in his acquittal; the other five colored men were taken up in order. And it is scarcely necessary to say that Messrs. Peirce and Birney did full justice to all concerned. Mr. Peirce, especially, was one of the oldest, ablest and most faithful lawyers to the slave of the Philadelphia Bar. He never was known, it may safely be said, to hesitate in the darkest days of Slavery to give his time and talents to the fugitive, even in the most hopeless cases, and when, from the unpopularity of such a course, serious sacrifices would be likely to result. Consequently he was but at home in this case, and most nobly did he defend his clients, with the same earnestness that a man would defend his fireside against the approach of burglars. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict of &quot;not guilty,&quot; as to all the persons in the first count, charging them with riot. In the second count, charging them with &quot;Assault and Battery&quot; (on Col. Wheeler) Ballard and Curtis were found &quot;guilty,&quot; the rest &quot;not guilty.&quot; The guilty were given about a week in jail. Thus ended this act in the Wheeler drama.</p><p>The following extract is taken from the correspondence of the New York Tribune touching Jane Johnson&#39;s presence in the court, and will be interesting on that account:</p><pre><code>&quot;But it was a bold and perilous move on the part of her friends,
and the deepest apprehensions were felt for a while, for the
result. The United States Marshal was there with his warrant and
an extra force to execute it. The officers of the court and
other State officers were there to protect the witness and
vindicate the laws of the State. Vandyke, the United States
District Attorney, swore he would take her. The State officers
swore he should not, and for a while it seemed that nothing
could avert a bloody scene. It was expected that the conflict
would take place at the door, when she should leave the room, so
that when she and her friends went out, and for some time after,
the most intense suspense pervaded the court-room. She was,
however, allowed to enter the carriage that awaited her without
disturbance. She was accompanied by Mr. McKim, Secretary of the
Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, Lucretia Mott and George
Corson, one of our most manly and intrepid police officers. The
carriage was followed by another filled with officers as a
guard; and thus escorted she was taken back in safety to the
house from which she had been brought. Her title to Freedom
under the laws of the State will hardly again be brought into
question.&quot;
</code></pre><p>Mr. Williamson was committed to prison by Judge Kane for contempt of Court, on the 27th day of July, 1855, and was released on the 3d day of November the same year, having gained, in the estimation of the friends of Freedom every where, a triumph and a fame which but few men in the great moral battle for Freedom could claim.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>THE ARRIVALS OF A SINGLE MONTH.</p><p>SIXTY PASSENGERS CAME IN ONE MONTH--TWENTY-EIGHT IN ONE ARRIVAL--GREAT PANIC AND INDIGNATION MEETING--INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE FROM MASTERS AND FUGITIVES.</p><p>The great number of cases to be here noticed forbids more than a brief reference to each passenger. As they arrived in parties, their narratives will be given in due order as found on the book of records:</p><p>William Griffen, Henry Moor, James Camper, Noah Ennells and Levin Parker. This party came from Cambridge, Md.</p><p>William is thirty-four years of age, of medium size and substantial appearance. He fled from James Waters, Esq., a lawyer, living in Cambridge. He was &quot;wealthy, close, and stingy,&quot; and owned nine head of slaves and a farm, on which William served. He was used very hard, which was the cause of his escape, though the idea that he was entitled to his freedom had been entertained for the previous twelve years. On preparing to take the Underground, he armed himself with a big butcher-knife, and resolved, if attacked, to make his enemies stand back. His master was a member of the Methodist Church.</p><p>Henry is tall, copper-colored, and about thirty years of age. He complained not so much of bad usage as of the utter distaste he had to working all the time for the &quot;white people for nothing.&quot; He was also decidedly of the opinion that every man should have his liberty. Four years ago his wife was &quot;sold away to Georgia&quot; by her young master; since which time not a word had he heard of her. She left three children, and he, in escaping, also had to leave them in the same hands that sold their mother. He was owned by Levin Dale, a farmer near Cambridge. Henry was armed with a six-barreled revolver, a large knife, and a determined mind.</p><p>James is twenty-four years of age, quite black, small size, keen look, and full of hope for the &quot;best part of Canada.&quot; He fled from Henry Hooper, &quot;a dashing young man and a member of the Episcopal Church.&quot; Left because he &quot;did not enjoy privileges&quot; as he wished to do. He was armed with two pistols and a dirk to defend himself.</p><p>Noah is only nineteen, quite dark, well-proportioned, and possessed of a fair average of common sense. He was owned by &quot;Black-head Bill LeCount,&quot; who &quot;followed drinking, chewing tobacco, catching &#39;runaways,&#39; and hanging around the court-house.&quot; However, he owned six head of slaves, and had a &quot;rough wife,&quot; who belonged to the Methodist Church. Left because he &quot;expected every day to be sold&quot;--his master being largely in &quot;debt.&quot; Brought with him a butcher-knife.</p><p>Levin is twenty-two, rather short built, medium size and well colored. He fled from Lawrence G. Colson, &quot;a very bad man, fond of drinking, great to fight and swear, and hard to please.&quot; His mistress was &quot;real rough; very bad, worse than he was as &#39;fur&#39; as she could be.&quot; Having been stinted with food and clothing and worked hard, was the apology offered by Levin for running off.</p><p>Stebney Swan, John Stinger, Robert Emerson, Anthony Pugh and Isabella ----. This company came from Portsmouth, Va. Stebney is thirty-four years of age, medium size, mulatto, and quite wide awake. He was owned by an oysterman by the name of Jos. Carter, who lived near Portsmouth. Naturally enough his master &quot;drank hard, gambled&quot; extensively, and in every other respect was a very ordinary man. Nevertheless, he &quot;owned twenty-five head,&quot; and had a wife and six children. Stebney testified that he had not been used hard, though he had been on the &quot;auction-block three times.&quot; Left because he was &quot;tired of being a servant.&quot; Armed with a broad-axe and hatchet, he started, joined by the above-named companions, and came in a skiff, by sea. Robert Lee was the brave Captain engaged to pilot this Slavery-sick party from the prison-house of bondage. And although every rod of rowing was attended with inconceivable peril, the desired haven was safely reached, and the overjoyed voyagers conducted to the Vigilance Committee.</p><p>John is about forty years of age, and so near white that a microscope would be required to discern his colored origin. His father was white, and his mother nearly so. He also had been owned by the oysterman alluded to above; had been captain of one of his oyster-boats, until recently. And but for his attempt some months back to make his escape, he might have been this day in the care of his kind-hearted master. But, because of this wayward step on the part of John, his master felt called upon to humble him. Accordingly, the captaincy was taken from him, and he was compelled to struggle on in a less honorable position. Occasionally John&#39;s mind would be refreshed by his master relating the hard times in the North, the great starvation among the blacks, etc. He would also tell John how much better off he was as a &quot;slave with a kind master to provide for all his wants,&quot; etc. Notwithstanding all this counsel, John did not rest contented until he was on the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>Robert was only nineteen, with an intelligent face and prepossessing manners; reads, writes and ciphers; and is about half Anglo-Saxon. He fled from Wm. H. Wilson, Esq., Cashier of the Virginia Bank. Until within the four years previous to Robert&#39;s escape, the cashier was spoken of as a &quot;very good man;&quot; but in consequence of speculations in a large Hotel in Portsmouth, and the then financial embarrassments, &quot;he had become seriously involved,&quot; and decidedly changed in his manners. Robert noticed this, and concluded he had &quot;better get out of danger as soon as possible.&quot;</p><p>Anthony and Isabella were an engaged couple, and desired to cast their lot where husband and wife could not be separated on the auction-block.</p><p>The following are of the Cambridge party, above alluded to. All left together, but for prudential reasons separated before reaching Philadelphia. The company that left Cambridge on the 24th of October may be thus recognized: Aaron Cornish and wife, with their six children; Solomon, George Anthony, Joseph, Edward James, Perry Lake, and a nameless babe, all very likely; Kit Anthony and wife Leah, and three children, Adam, Mary, and Murray; Joseph Hill and wife Alice, and their son Henry; also Joseph&#39;s sister. Add to the above, Marshall Button and George Light, both single young men, and we have twenty-eight in one arrival, as hearty-looking, brave and interesting specimens of Slavery as could well be produced from Maryland. Before setting out they counted well the cost. Being aware that fifteen had left their neighborhood only a few days ahead of them, and that every slave-holder and slave-catcher throughout the community, were on the alert, and raging furiously against the inroads of the Underground Rail Road, they provided themselves with the following weapons of defense: three revolvers, three double-barreled pistols, three single-barreled pistols, three sword-canes, four butcher knives, one bowie-knife, and one paw.[A] Thus, fully resolved upon freedom or death, with scarcely provisions enough for a single day, while the rain and storm was piteously descending, fathers and mothers with children in their arms (Aaron Cornish had two)--the entire party started. Of course, their provisions gave out before they were fairly on the way, but not so with the storm. It continued to pour upon them for nearly three days. With nothing to appease the gnawings of hunger but parched corn and a few dry crackers, wet and cold, with several of the children sick, some of their feet bare and worn, and one of the mothers with an infant in her arms, incapable of partaking of the diet,--it is impossible to imagine the ordeal they were passing.

Levi D. Traverse.
</code></pre><p>To fully understand the Rev. Mr. Traverse&#39;s authority for taking the liberty he did with Aaron&#39;s good name, it may not be amiss to give briefly a paragraph of private information from Aaron, relative to his master. The Rev. Mr. Traverse belonged to the Methodist Church, and was described by Aaron as a &quot;bad young man; rattle-brained; with the appearance of not having good sense,--not enough to manage the great amount of property (he had been left wealthy) in his possession.&quot; Aaron&#39;s servitude commenced under this spiritual protector in May prior to the escape, immediately after the death of his old master. His deceased master, William D. Traverse, by the way, was the father-in-law, and at the same time own uncle of Aaron&#39;s reverend owner. Though the young master, for marrying his own cousin and uncle&#39;s daughter, had been for years the subject of the old gentleman&#39;s wrath, and was not allowed to come near his house, or to entertain any reasonable hope of getting any of his father-in-law&#39;s estate, nevertheless, scarcely had the old man breathed his last, ere the young preacher seized upon the inheritance, slaves and all; at least he claimed two-thirds, allowing for the widow one-third. Unhesitatingly he had taken possession of all the slaves (some thirty head), and was making them feel his power to the fullest extent. To Aaron this increased oppression was exceedingly crushing, as he had been hoping at the death of his old master to be free. Indeed, it was understood that the old man had his will made, and freedom provided for the slaves. But, strangely enough, at his death no will could be found. Aaron was firmly of the conviction that the Rev. Mr. Traverse knew what became of it. Between the widow and the son-in-law, in consequence of his aggressive steps, existed much hostility, which strongly indicated the approach of a law-suit; therefore, except by escaping, Aaron could not see the faintest hope of freedom. Under his old master, the favor of hiring his time had been granted him. He had also been allowed by his wife&#39;s mistress (Miss Jane Carter, of Baltimore), to have his wife and children home with him--that is, until his children would grow to the age of eight and ten years, then they would be taken away and hired out at twelve or fifteen dollars a year at first. Her oldest boy, sixteen, hired the year he left for forty dollars. They had had ten children; two had died, two they were compelled to leave in chains; the rest they brought away. Not one dollar&#39;s expense had they been to their mistress. The industrious Aaron not only had to pay his own hire, but was obliged to do enough over-work to support his large family.</p><p>Though he said he had no special complaint to make against his old master, through whom he, with the rest of the slaves, hoped to obtain freedom, Aaron, nevertheless, spoke of him as a man of violent temper, severe on his slaves, drinking hard, etc., though he was a man of wealth and stood high in the community. One of Aaron&#39;s brothers, and others, had been sold South by him. It was on account of his inveterate hatred of his son-in-law, who, he declared, should never have his property (having no other heir but his niece, except his widow), that the slaves relied on his promise to free them. Thus, in view of the facts referred to, Aaron was led to commit the unpardonable sin of running away with his wife Daffney, who, by the way, looked like a woman fully capable of taking care of herself and children, instead of having them stolen away from her, as though they were pigs.</p><p>Joseph Viney and family--Joseph was &quot;held to service or labor,&quot; by Charles Bryant, of Alexandria, Va. Joseph had very nearly finished paying for himself. His wife and children were held by Samuel Pattison, Esq., a member of the Methodist Church, &quot;a great big man,&quot; &quot;with red eyes, bald head, drank pretty freely,&quot; and in the language of Joseph, &quot;wouldn&#39;t bear nothing.&quot; Two of Joseph&#39;s brothers-in-law had been sold by his master. Against Mrs. Pattison his complaint was, that &quot;she was mean, sneaking, and did not want to give half enough to eat.&quot;</p><p>For the enlightenment of all Christendom, and coming posterity especially, the following advertisement and letter are recorded, with the hope that they will have an important historical value. The writer was at great pains to obtain these interesting documents, directly after the arrival of the memorable Twenty-Eight; and shortly afterwards furnished to the New York <em>Tribune</em>, in a prudential manner, a brief sketch of these very passengers, including the advertisements, but not the letter.

If you should want any information, witnesses to prove or
indentify the negroes, write immediately on to me. Or if you
should need any information with regard to proving the negroes,
before I could reach Philadelphia, you can call on Mr. Burroughs
at Martin &amp; Smith&#39;s store, Market Street, No 308. Phila and he
can refer you to a gentleman who knows the negroes.

Yours &amp;c SAML. PATTISON.
</code></pre><p>This letter was in answer to one written in Philadelphia and signed, &quot;L.W. Thompson.&quot; It is not improbable that Mr. Pattison&#39;s loss had produced such a high state of mental excitement that he was hardly in a condition for cool reflection, or he would have weighed the matter a little more carefully before exposing himself to the U.G.R.R. agents. But the letter possesses two commendable features, nevertheless. It was tolerably well written and prompt.</p><p>Here is a wonderful exhibition of affection for his contented and happy negroes. Whether Mr. Pattison suspended on suddenly learning that he was minus fifteen head, the writer cannot say. But that there was a great slave hunt in every direction there is no room to doubt. Though much more might be said about the parties concerned, it must suffice to add that they came to the Vigilance Committee in a very sad plight--in tattered garments, hungry, sick, and penniless; but they were kindly clothed, fed, doctored, and sent on their way rejoicing.</p><p>Daniel Stanly, Nat Amby, John Scott, Hannah Peters, Henrietta Dobson, Elizabeth Amby, Josiah Stanly, Caroline Stanly, Daniel Stanly, jr., John Stanly and Miller Stanly (arrival from Cambridge.) Daniel is about 35, well-made and wide-awake. Fortunately, in emancipating himself, he also, through great perseverance, secured the freedom of his wife and six children; one child he was compelled to leave behind. Daniel belonged to Robert Calender, a farmer, and, &quot;except when in a passion,&quot; said to be &quot;pretty clever.&quot; However, considering as a father, that it was his &quot;duty to do all he could&quot; for his children, and that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, Daniel felt bound to seek refuge in Canada. His wife and children were owned by &quot;Samuel Count, an old, bald-headed, bad man,&quot; who &quot;had of late years been selling and buying slaves as a business,&quot; though he stood high and was a &quot;big bug in Cambridge.&quot; The children were truly likely-looking.</p><p>Nat is no ordinary man. Like a certain other Nat known to history, his honest and independent bearing in every respect was that of a natural hero. He was full black, and about six feet high; of powerful physical proportions, and of more than ordinary intellectual capacities. With the strongest desire to make the Port of Canada safely, he had resolved to be &quot;carried back,&quot; if attacked by the slave hunters, &quot;only as a dead man.&quot; He was held to service by John Muir, a wealthy farmer, and the owner of 40 or 50 slaves. &quot;Muir would drink and was generally devilish.&quot; Two of Nat&#39;s sisters and one of his brothers had been &quot;sold away to Georgia by him.&quot; Therefore, admonished by threats and fears of having to pass through the same fiery furnace, Nat was led to consider the U.G.R.R. scheme. It was through the marriage of Nat&#39;s mistress to his present owner that he came into Muir&#39;s hands. &quot;Up to the time of her death,&quot; he had been encouraged to &quot;hope&quot; that he would be &quot;free;&quot; indeed, he was assured by her &quot;dying testimony that the slaves were not to be sold.&quot; But regardless of the promises and will of his departed wife, Muir soon extinguished all hopes of freedom from that quarter. But not believing that God had put one man here to &quot;be the servant of another--to work,&quot; and get none of the benefit of his labor, Nat armed himself with a good pistol and a big knife, and taking his wife with him, bade adieu forever to bondage. Observing that Lizzie (Nat&#39;s wife) looked pretty decided and resolute, a member of the committee remarked, &quot;Would your wife fight for freedom?&quot; &quot;I have heard her say she would wade through blood and tears for her freedom,&quot; said Nat, in the most serious mood.</p><p>The following advertisement from <em>The Cambridge Democrat</em> of Nov. 4, speaks for itself--</p><pre><code>$300 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, on Saturday night
last, 17th inst., my negro woman Lizzie, about 28 years old. She
is medium sized, dark complexion, good-looking, with rather a
down look. When spoken to, replies quickly. She was well
dressed, wearing a red and green blanket shawl, and carried with
her a variety of clothing. She ran off in company with her
husband, Nat Amby (belonging to John Muir, Esq.), who is about 6
feet in height, with slight impediment in his speech, dark
chestnut color, and a large scar on the side of his neck.

</code></pre><p>John is nineteen years of age, mulatto, spare made, but not lacking in courage, mother wit or perseverance. He was born in Fauquier county, Va., and, after experiencing Slavery for a number of years there--being sold two or three times to the &quot;highest bidder&quot;--he was finally purchased by a cotton planter named Hezekiah Thompson, residing at Huntsville, Alabama. Immediately after the sale Hezekiah bundled his new &quot;purchase&quot; off to Alabama, where he succeeded in keeping him only about two years, for at the end of that time John determined to strike a blow for liberty. The incentive to this step was the inhuman treatment he was subjected to. Cruel indeed did he find it there. His master was a young man, &quot;fond of drinking and carousing, and always ready for a fight or a knock-down.&quot; A short time before John left his master whipped him so severely with the &quot;bull whip&quot; that he could not use his arm for three or four days. Seeing but one way of escape (and that more perilous than the way William and Ellen Craft, or Henry Box Brown traveled), he resolved to try it. It was to get on the top of the car, instead of inside of it, and thus ride of nights, till nearly daylight, when, at a stopping-place on the road, he would slip off the car, and conceal himself in the woods until under cover of the next night he could manage to get on the top of another car. By this most hazardous mode of travel he reached Virginia.</p><p>It may be best not to attempt to describe how he suffered at the hands of his owners in Alabama; or how severely he was pinched with hunger in traveling; or how, when he reached his old neighborhood in Virginia, he could not venture to inquire for his mother, brothers or sisters, to receive from them an affectionate word, an encouraging smile, a crust of bread, or a drink of water.</p><p>Success attended his efforts for more than two weeks; but alas, after having got back north of Richmond, on his way home to Alexandria, he was captured and put in prison; his master being informed of the fact, came on and took possession of him again. At first he refused to sell him; said he &quot;had money enough and owned about thirty slaves;&quot; therefore wished to &quot;take him back to make an example of him.&quot; However, through the persuasion of an uncle of his, he consented to sell. Accordingly, John was put on the auction-block and bought for $1,300 by Green McMurray, a regular trader in Richmond. McMurray again offered him for sale, but in consequence of hard times and the high price demanded, John did not go off, at least not in the way the trader desired to dispose of him, but did, nevertheless, succeed in going off on the Underground Rail Road. Thus once more he reached his old home, Alexandria. His mother was in one place, and his six brothers and sisters evidently scattered, where he knew not. Since he was five years of age, not one of them had he seen.</p><p>If such sufferings and trials were not entitled to claim for the sufferer the honor of a hero, where in all Christendom could one be found who could prove a better title to that appellation?</p><p>It is needless to say that the Committee extended to him brotherly kindness, sympathized with him deeply, and sent him on his way rejoicing.</p><p>Of his subsequent career the following extract from a letter written at London shows that he found no rest for the soles of his feet under the Stars and Stripes in New York:</p><pre><code>I hope that you will remember John Thompson, who passed through
your hands, I think, in October, 1857, at the same time that Mr.
Cooper, from Charleston, South Carolina, came on. I was engaged

He fled from Charleston, where he had been owned by Mrs. E. Williamson, an old lady about seventy-five, a member of the Episcopal Church, and opposed to Freedom. As far as he was concerned, however, he said, she had treated him well; but, knowing that the old lady would not be long here, he judged it was best to look out in time. Consequently, he availed himself of an Underground Rail Road ticket, and bade adieu to that hot-bed of secession, South Carolina. Indeed, he was fair enough to pass for white, and actually came the entire journey from Charleston to this city under the garb of a white gentleman. With regard to gentlemanly bearing, however, he was all right in this particular. Nevertheless, as he had been a slave all his days, he found that it required no small amount of nerve to succeed in running the gauntlet with slave-holders and slave-catchers for so long a journey.</p><p>The following pointed epistle, from Jeremiah Colburn alias William Cooper, beautifully illustrates the effects of Freedom on many a passenger who received hospitalities at the Philadelphia depot--</p><pre><code>SYRACUSE, June 9th, 1858.

</code></pre><p>It will be seen that this young Charlestonian had rather exalted notions in his head. He was contemplating going to McGrawville College, for the purpose of preparing himself for the lecturing field. Was it not rather strange that he did not want to return to his &quot;kind-hearted old mistress?&quot;</p><p>THOMAS HENRY, NATHAN COLLINS AND HIS WIFE MARY ELLEN.--Thomas is about twenty-six, quite dark, rather of a raw-boned make, indicating that times with him had been other than smooth. A certain Josiah Wilson owned Thomas. He was a cross, rugged man, allowing not half enough to eat, and worked his slaves late and early. Especially within the last two or three months previous to the escape, he had been intensely savage, in consequence of having lost, not long before, two of his servants. Ever since that misfortune, he had frequently talked of &quot;putting the rest in his pocket.&quot; This distressing threat made the rest love him none the more; but, to make assurances doubly sure, after giving them their supper every evening, which consisted of delicious &quot;skimmed milk, corn cake and a herring each,&quot; he would very carefully send them up in the loft over the kitchen, and there &quot;lock them up,&quot; to remain until called the next morning at three or four o&#39;clock to go to work again. Destitute of money, clothing, and a knowledge of the way, situated as they were they concluded to make an effort for Canada.</p><p>NATHAN was also a fellow-servant with Thomas, and of course owned by Wilson. Nathan&#39;s wife, however, was owned by Wilson&#39;s son, Abram. Nathan was about twenty-five years of age, not very dark. He had a remarkably large head on his shoulders and was the picture of determination, and apparently was exactly the kind of a subject that might be desirable in the British possessions, in the forest or on the farm.</p><p>His wife, Mary Ellen, is a brown-skinned, country-looking young woman, about twenty years of age. In escaping, they had to break jail, in the dead of night, while all were asleep in the big house; and thus they succeeded. What Mr. Wilson did, said or thought about these &quot;shiftless&quot; creatures we are not prepared to say; we may, notwithstanding, reasonably infer that the Underground has come in for a liberal share of his indignation and wrath. The above travelers came from near New Market, Md.

ten miles from the house of his, her or their master, mistress

his, her or their overseer, if any be, under the penalty of
being taken for a runaway, and to suffer such penalties as
hereafter provided against runaways.&#39; The Act of 1806, chap. 81,

ESTEEMED FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--I write to inform thee that we
have either 17 or 27, I am not certain which, of that large Gang
of God&#39;s poor, and I hope they are safe. The man who has them in
charge informed me there were 27 safe and one boy lost during
last night, about 14 years of age, without shoes; we have felt
some anxiety about him, for fear he may be taken up and betray
the rest. I have since been informed there are but 17 so that I
cannot at present tell which is correct. I have several looking
out for the lad; they will be kept from Phila. for the present.
My principal object in writing thee at this time is to inform
thee of what one of our constables told me this morning; he told
me that a colored man in Phila. who professed to be a great
friend of the colored people was a traitor; that he had been
written to by an Abolitionist in Baltimore, to keep a look out
for those slaves that left Cambridge this night week, told him
they would be likely to pass through Wilmington on 6th day or
7th day night, and the colored man in Phila. had written to the
master of part of them telling him the above, and the master
arrived here yesterday in consequence of the information, and
told one of our constables the above; the man told the name of
the Baltimore writer, which he had forgotten, but declined
telling the name of the colored man in Phila. I hope you will be
able to find out who he is, and should I be able to learn the
name of the Baltimore friend, I will put him on his Guard,
respecting his Phila. correspondents. As ever thy friend, and
the friend of Humanity, without regard to color or clime.

DEAR FRIEND:--Eight more of the large company reached our place
last night, direct from Ercildown. The eight constitute one
family of them, the husband and wife with four children under
eight years of age, wish tickets for Elmira. Three sons, nearly
grown, will be forwarded to Phila., probably by the train which
passes Phoenixville at seven o&#39;clock of to-morrow evening the
seventh. It would be safest to meet them there. We shall send
them to Elijah with the request for them to be sent there. And I
presume they will be. If they should not arrive you may suppose
it did not suit Elijah to send them.

We will send the money for the tickets by C.C. Burleigh, who
will be in Phila. on second day morning. If you please, you will
forward the tickets by to-morrow&#39;s mail as we do not have a mail
again till third day.

Yours hastily,

Q. LEWIS.

Please give directions for forwarding to Elmira and name the
price of tickets.
</code></pre><p>At first Miss Lewis thought of forwarding only a part of her fugitive guests to the Committee in Philadelphia, but on further consideration, all were safely sent along in due time, and the Committee took great pains to have them made as comfortable as possible, as the cases of these mothers and children especially called forth the deepest sympathy.</p><p>In this connection it seems but fitting to allude to Captain Lee&#39;s sufferings on account of his having brought away in a skiff, by sea, a party of four, alluded to in the beginning of this single month&#39;s report.</p><p>Unfortunately he was suspected, arrested, tried, convicted, and torn from his wife and two little children, and sent to the Richmond Penitentiary for twenty-five years. Before being sent away from Portsmouth, Va., where he was tried, for ten days in succession in the prison five lashes a day were laid heavily on his bare back. The further sufferings of poor Lee and his heart-broken wife, and his little daughter and son, are too painful for minute recital. In this city the friends of Freedom did all in their power to comfort Mrs. Lee, and administered aid to her and her children; but she broke down under her mournful fate, and went to that bourne from whence no traveler ever returns.</p><p>Captain Lee suffered untold misery in prison, until he, also, not a great while before the Union forces took possession of Richmond, sank beneath the severity of his treatment, and went likewise to the grave. The two children for a long time were under the care of Mr. Wm. Ingram of Philadelphia, who voluntarily, from pure benevolence, proved himself to be a father and a friend to them. To their poor mother also he had been a true friend.</p><p>The way in which Captain Lee came to be convicted, if the Committee were correctly informed and they think they were, was substantially in this wise: In the darkness of the night, four men, two of them constables, one of the other two, the owner of one of the slaves who had been aided away by Lee, seized the wife of one of the fugitives and took her to the woods, where the fiends stripped every particle of clothing from her person, tied her to a tree, and armed with knives, cowhides and a shovel, swore vengeance against her, declaring they would kill her if she did not testify against Lee. At first she refused to reveal the secret; indeed she knew but little to reveal; but her savage tormentors beat her almost to death. Under this barbarous infliction she was constrained to implicate Captain Lee, which was about all the evidence the prosecution had against him. And in reality her evidence, for two reasons, should not have weighed a straw, as it was contrary to the laws of the State of Virginia, to admit the testimony of colored persons against white; then again for the reason that this testimony was obtained wholly by brute force.</p><p>But in this instance, this woman on whom the murderous attack had been made, was brought into court on Lee&#39;s trial and was bid to simply make her statement with regard to Lee&#39;s connection with the escape of her husband. This she did of course. And in the eyes of this chivalric court, this procedure &quot;was all right.&quot; But thank God the events since those dark and dreadful days, afford abundant proof that the All-seeing Eye was not asleep to the daily sufferings of the poor bondman.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>A SLAVE GIRL&#39;S NARRATIVE.</p><p>CORDELIA LONEY, SLAVE OF MRS. JOSEPH CAHELL (WIDOW OF THE LATE HON. JOSEPH CAHELL, OF VA.), OF FREDERICKSBURG, VA.--CORDELIA&#39;S ESCAPE FROM HER MISTRESS IN PHILADELPHIA.</p><p>Rarely did the peculiar institution present the relations of mistress and maid-servant in a light so apparently favorable as in the case of Mrs. Joseph Cahell (widow of the late Hon. Jos Cahell, of Va.), and her slave, Cordelia. The Vigilance Committee&#39;s first knowledge of either of these memorable personages was brought about in the following manner.</p><p>About the 30th of March, in the year 1859, a member of the Vigilance Committee was notified by a colored servant, living at a fashionable boarding-house on Chestnut street that a lady with a slave woman from Fredericksburg, Va., was boarding at said house, and, that said slave woman desired to receive counsel and aid from the Committee, as she was anxious to secure her freedom, before her mistress returned to the South. On further consultation about the matter, a suitable hour was named for the meeting of the Committee and the Slave at the above named boarding-house. Finding that the woman was thoroughly reliable, the Committee told her &quot;that two modes of deliverance were open before her. One was to take her trunk and all her clothing and quietly retire.&quot; The other was to &quot;sue out a writ of habeas corpus; and bring the mistress before the Court, where she would be required, under the laws of Pennsylvania, to show cause why she restrained this woman of her freedom.&quot; Cordelia concluded to adopt the former expedient, provided the Committee would protect her. Without hesitation the Committee answered her, that to the extent of their ability, she should have their aid with pleasure, without delay. Consequently a member of the Committee was directed to be on hand at a given hour that evening, as Cordelia would certainly be ready to leave her mistress to take care of herself. Thus, at the appointed hour, Cordelia, very deliberately, accompanied the Committee away from her &quot;kind hearted old mistress.&quot;</p><p>In the quiet and security of the Vigilance Committee Room, Cordelia related substantially the following brief story touching her relationship as a slave to Mrs. Joseph Cahell. In this case, as with thousands and tens of thousands of others, as the old adage fitly expresses it, &quot;All is not gold that glitters.&quot; Under this apparently pious and noble-minded lady, it will be seen, that Cordelia had known naught but misery and sorrow.</p><p>Mrs. Cahell, having engaged board for a month at a fashionable private boarding-house on Chestnut street, took an early opportunity to caution Cordelia against going into the streets, and against having anything to say or do with &quot;free niggers in particular&quot;; withal, she appeared unusually kind, so much so, that before retiring to bed in the evening, she would call Cordelia to her chamber, and by her side would take her Prayer-book and Bible, and go through the forms of devotional service. She stood very high both as a church communicant and a lady in society.</p><p>For a fortnight it seemed as though her prayers were to be answered, for Cordelia apparently bore herself as submissively as ever, and Madame received calls and accepted invitations from some of the <em>elite</em> of the city, without suspecting any intention on the part of Cordelia to escape. But Cordelia could not forget how her children had all been sold by her mistress!</p><p>Cordelia was about fifty-seven years of age, with about an equal proportion of colored and white blood in her veins; very neat, respectful and prepossessing in manner.</p><p>From her birth to the hour of her escape she had worn the yoke under Mrs. C., as her most efficient and reliable maid-servant. She had been at her mistress&#39; beck and call as seamstress, dressing-maid, nurse in the sickroom, etc., etc., under circumstances that might appear to the casual observer uncommonly favorable for a slave. Indeed, on his first interview with her, the Committee man was so forcibly impressed with the belief, that her condition in Virginia had been favorable, that he hesitated to ask her if she did not desire her liberty. A few moments&#39; conversation with her, however, convinced him of her good sense and decision of purpose with regard to this matter. For, in answer to the first question he put to her, she answered, that, &quot;As many creature comforts and religious privileges as she had been the recipient of under her &#39;kind mistress,&#39; still she &#39;wanted to be free,&#39; and &#39;was bound to leave,&#39; that she had been &#39;treated very cruelly,&#39; that her children had &#39;all been sold away&#39; from her; that she had been threatened with sale herself &#39;on the first insult,&#39;&quot; etc.</p><p>She was willing to take the entire responsibility of taking care of herself. On the suggestion of a friend, before leaving her mistress, she was disposed to sue for her freedom, but, upon a reconsideration of the matter, she chose rather to accept the hospitality of the Underground Rail Road, and leave in a quiet way and go to Canada, where she would be free indeed. Accordingly she left her mistress and was soon a free woman.</p><p>The following sad experience she related calmly, in the presence of several friends, an evening or two after she left her mistress:</p><p>Two sons and two daughters had been sold from her by her mistress, within the last three years, since the death of her master. Three of her children had been sold to the Richmond market and the other in Nelson county.</p><p>Paulina was the first sold, two years ago last May. Nat was the next; he was sold to Abram Warrick, of Richmond. Paulina was sold before it was named to her mother that it had entered her mistress&#39;s mind to dispose of her. Nancy, from infancy, had been in poor health. Nevertheless, she had been obliged to take her place in the field with the rest of the slaves, of more rugged constitution, until she had passed her twentieth year, and had become a mother. Under these circumstances, the overseer and his wife complained to the mistress that her health was really too bad for a field hand and begged that she might be taken where her duties would be less oppressive. Accordingly, she was withdrawn from the field, and was set to spinning and weaving. When too sick to work her mistress invariably took the ground, that &quot;nothing was the matter,&quot; notwithstanding the fact, that her family physician, Dr. Ellsom, had pronounced her &quot;quite weakly and sick.&quot;</p><p>In an angry mood one day, Mrs. Cahell declared she would cure her; and again sent her to the field, &quot;with orders to the overseer, to whip her every day, and make her work or kill her.&quot; Again the overseer said it was &quot;no use to try, for her health would not stand it,&quot; and she was forthwith returned. The mistress then concluded to sell her.</p><p>One Sabbath evening a nephew of hers, who resided in New Orleans, happened to be on a visit to his aunt, when it occurred to her, that she had &quot;better get Nancy off if possible.&quot; Accordingly, Nancy was called in for examination. Being dressed in her &quot;Sunday best&quot; and &quot;before a poor candle-light,&quot; she appeared to good advantage; and the nephew concluded to start with her on the following Tuesday morning. However, the next morning, he happened to see her by the light of the sun, and in her working garments, which satisfied him that he had been grossly deceived; that she would barely live to reach New Orleans; he positively refused to carry out the previous evening&#39;s contract, thus leaving her in the hands of her mistress, with the advice, that she should &quot;doctor her up.&quot;</p><p>The mistress, not disposed to be defeated, obviated the difficulty by selecting a little boy, made a lot of the two, and thus made it an inducement to a purchaser to buy the sick woman; the boy and the woman brought $700.</p><p>In the sale of her children, Cordelia was as little regarded as if she had been a cow.</p><p>&quot;I felt wretched,&quot; she said, with emphasis, &quot;when I heard that Nancy had been sold,&quot; which was not until after she had been removed. &quot;But,&quot; she continued, &quot;I was not at liberty to make my grief known to a single white soul. I wept and couldn&#39;t help it.&quot; But remembering that she was liable, &quot;on the first insult,&quot; to be sold herself, she sought no sympathy from her mistress, whom she describes as &quot;a woman who shows as little kindness towards her servants as any woman in the States of America. She neither likes to feed nor clothe well.&quot;</p><p>With regard to flogging, however, in days past, she had been up to the mark. &quot;A many a slap and blow&quot; had Cordelia received since she arrived at womanhood, directly from the madam&#39;s own hand.</p><p>One day smarting under cruel treatment, she appealed to her mistress in the following strain: &quot;I stood by your mother in all her sickness and nursed her till she died!&quot; &quot;I waited on your niece, night and day for months, till she died.&quot; &quot;I waited upon your husband all my life--in his sickness especially, and shrouded him in death, etc., yet I am treated cruelly.&quot; It was of no avail.</p><p>Her mistress, at one time, was the owner of about five hundred slaves, but within the last few years she had greatly lessened the number by sales.</p><p>She stood very high as a lady, and was a member of the Episcopal Church.</p><p>To punish Cordelia, on several occasions, she had been sent to one of the plantations to work as a field hand. Fortunately, however, she found the overseers more compassionate than her mistress, though she received no particular favors from any of them.</p><p>Asking her to name the overseers, etc., she did so. The first was &quot;Marks, a thin-visaged, poor-looking man, great for swearing.&quot; The second was &quot;Gilbert Brower, a very rash, portly man.&quot; The third was &quot;Buck Young, a stout man, and very sharp.&quot; The fourth was &quot;Lynn Powell, a tall man with red whiskers, very contrary and spiteful.&quot; There was also a fifth one, but his name was lost.</p><p>Thus Cordelia&#39;s experience, though chiefly confined to the &quot;great house,&quot; extended occasionally over the corn and tobacco fields, among the overseers and field hands generally. But under no circumstances could she find it in her heart to be thankful for the privileges of Slavery.</p><p>After leaving her mistress she learned, with no little degree of pleasure, that a perplexed state of things existed at the boarding-house; that her mistress was seriously puzzled to imagine how she would get her shoes and stockings on and off; how she would get her head combed, get dressed, be attended to in sickness, etc., as she (Cordelia), had been compelled to discharge these offices all her life.</p><p>Most of the boarders, being slave-holders, naturally sympathized in her affliction; and some of them went so far as to offer a reward to some of the colored servants to gain a knowledge of her whereabouts. Some charged the servants with having a hand in her leaving, but all agreed that &quot;she had left a very kind and indulgent mistress,&quot; and had acted very foolishly in running out of Slavery into Freedom.</p><p>A certain Doctor of Divinity, the pastor of an Episcopal church in this city and a friend of the mistress, hearing of her distress, by request or voluntarily, undertook to find out Cordelia&#39;s place of seclusion. Hailing on the street a certain colored man with a familiar face, who he thought knew nearly all the colored people about town, he related to him the predicament of his lady friend from the South, remarked how kindly she had always treated her servants, signified that Cordelia would rue the change, and be left to suffer among the &quot;miserable blacks down town,&quot; that she would not be able to take care of herself; quoted Scripture justifying Slavery, and finally suggested that he (the colored man) would be doing a duty and a kindness to the fugitive by using his influence to &quot;find her and prevail upon her to return.&quot;</p><p>It so happened that the colored man thus addressed, was Thomas Dorsey, the well-known fashionable caterer of Philadelphia, who had had the experience of quite a number of years as a slave at the South,--had himself once been pursued as a fugitive, and having, by his industry in the condition of Freedom, acquired a handsome estate, he felt entirely qualified to reply to the reverend gentleman, which he did, though in not very respectful phrases, telling him that Cordelia had as good a right to her liberty as he had, or her mistress either; that God had never intended one man to be the slave of another; that it was all false about the slaves being better off than the free colored people; that he would find as many &quot;poor, miserably degraded,&quot; of his own color &quot;down-town,&quot; as among the &quot;degraded blacks&quot;; and concluded by telling him that he would &quot;rather give her a hundred dollars to help her off, than to do aught to make known her whereabouts, if he knew ever so much about her.&quot;</p><p>What further steps were taken by the discomfited divine, the mistress, or her boarding-house sympathizers, the Committee was not informed.</p><p>But with regard to Cordelia: she took her departure for Canada, in the midst of the Daniel Webster (fugitive) trial, with the hope of being permitted to enjoy the remainder of her life in Freedom and peace. Being a member of the Baptist Church, and professing to be a Christian, she was persuaded that, by industry and assistance of the Lord, a way would be opened to the seeker of Freedom even in a strange land and among strangers.</p><p>This story appeared in part in the <em>N.Y. Evening Post</em>, having been furnished by the writer, without his name to it. It is certainly none the less interesting now, as it may be read in the light of Universal Emancipation.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>ARRIVAL OF JACKSON, ISAAC AND EDMONDSON TURNER FROM PETERSBURG.</p><p>TOUCHING SCENE ON MEETING THEIR OLD BLIND FATHER AT THE U.G.R.R. DEPOT.</p><p>LETTERS AND WARNING TO SLAVEHOLDERS.</p><p>About the latter part of December, 1857, Isaac and Edmondson, brothers, succeeded in making their escape together from Petersburg, Va. They barely escaped the auction block, as their mistress, Mrs. Ann Colley, a widow, had just completed arrangements for their sale on the coming first day of January. In this kind of property, however, Mrs. Colley had not largely invested. In the days of her prosperity, while all was happy and contented, she could only boast of &quot;four head:&quot; these brothers, Jackson, Isaac and Edmondson and one other. In May, 1857, Jackson had fled and was received by the Vigilance Committee, who placed him upon their books briefly in the following light:</p><pre><code>&quot;RUNAWAY--_Fifty Dollars Reward_,--Ran away some time in May
last, my _Servant-man_, who calls himself _Jackson Turner_. He
is about 27 years of age, and has one of his front teeth out. He
is quite black, with thick lips, a little bow-legged, and looks
down when spoken to. I will give a reward of Fifty dollars if
taken out of the city, and twenty five Dollars if taken within
the city. I forewarn all masters of vessels from harboring or
employing the said slave; all persons who disregard this Notice
will be punished as the law directs.

ANN COLLEY.

Petersburg, June 8th, 1857.&quot;
</code></pre><p>JACKSON is quite dark, medium size, and well informed for one in his condition. In Slavery, he had been &quot;pressed hard.&quot; His hire, &quot;ten dollars per month&quot; he was obliged to produce at the end of each month, no matter how much he had been called upon to expend for &quot;doctor bills, &amp;c.&quot; The woman he called mistress went by the name of Ann Colley, a widow, living near Petersburg. &quot;She was very quarrelsome,&quot; although a &quot;member of the Methodist Church.&quot; Jackson seeing that his mistress was yearly growing &quot;harder and harder,&quot; concluded to try and better his condition &quot;if possible.&quot; Having a free wife in the North, who was in the habit of communicating with him, he was kept fully awake to the love of Freedom. The Underground Rail Road expense the Committee gladly bore. No further record of Jackson was made. Jackson found his poor old father here, where he had resided for a number of years in a state of almost total blindness, and of course in much parental anxiety about his boys in chains. On the arrival of Jackson, his heart overflowed with joy and gratitude not easily described, as the old man had hardly been able to muster faith enough to believe that he should ever look with his dim eyes upon one of his sons in Freedom. After a day or two&#39;s tarrying, Jackson took his departure for safer and more healthful localities,--her &quot;British Majesty&#39;s possessions.&quot; The old man remained only to feel more keenly than ever, the pang of having sons still toiling in hopeless servitude.</p><p>In less than seven months after Jackson had shaken off the yoke, to the unspeakable joy of the father, Isaac and Edmondson succeeded in following their brother&#39;s example, and were made happy partakers of the benefits and blessings of the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia. On first meeting his two boys, at the Underground Rail Road Depot, the old man took each one in his arms, and as looking through a glass darkly, straining every nerve of his almost lost sight, exclaiming, whilst hugging them closer and closer to his bosom for some minutes, in tears of joy and wonder, &quot;My son Isaac, is this you? my son Isaac, is this you, &amp;c.?&quot; The scene was calculated to awaken the deepest emotion and to bring tears to eyes not accustomed to weep. Little had the old man dreamed in his days of sadness, that he should share such a feast of joy over the deliverance of his sons. But it is in vain to attempt to picture the affecting scene at this reunion, for that would be impossible. Of their slave life, the records contain but a short notice, simply as follows:</p><p>&quot;Isaac is twenty-eight years of age, hearty-looking, well made, dark color and intelligent. He was owned by Mrs. Ann Colley, a widow, residing near Petersburg, Va. Isaac and Edmondson were to have been sold, on New Year&#39;s day; a few days hence. How sad her disappointment must have been on finding them gone, may be more easily imagined than described.&quot;</p><p>Edmondson is about twenty-five, a brother of Isaac, and a smart, good-looking young man, was owned by Mrs. Colley also. &quot;This is just the class of fugitives to make good subjects for John Bull,&quot; thought the Committee, feeling pretty well assured that they would make good reports after having enjoyed free air in Canada for a short time. Of course, the Committee enjoined upon them very earnestly &quot;not to forget their brethren left behind groaning in fetters; but to prove by their industry, uprightness, economy, sobriety and thrift, by the remembrance of their former days of oppression and their obligations to their God, that they were worthy of the country to which they were going, and so to help break the bands of the oppressors, and undo the heavy burdens of the oppressed.&quot; Similar advice was impressed upon the minds of all travelers passing over this branch of the Underground Rail Road. From hundreds thus admonished, letters came affording the most gratifying evidence that the counsel of the Committee was not in vain. The appended letter from the youngest brother, written with his own hand, will indicate his feelings and views in Canada:</p><pre><code>HAMILTON, CANADA WEST Mar. 1, 1858.

prayer is to you, oh, slaveholder, in the name of that God who
in the beginning said, Let there be light, and there was light.
Let my People go that they may serve me; thereby good may come
unto thee and to thy children&#39;s children. Slave-holder have you
seriously thought upon the condition yourselves, family and
slaves; have you read where Christ has enjoined upon all his
creatures to read his word, thereby that they may have no excuse
when coming before his judgment seat? But you say he shall not
read his word, consequently his sin will be upon your head. I
think every man has as much as he can do to answer for his own
sins. And now my dear-slave-holder, who with you are bound and
fast hastening to judgment? As one that loves your soul repent
ye, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of
the Lord.

In the language of the poet:

  Stop, poor sinner, stop and think,
    Before you further go;
  Think upon the brink of death
    Of everlasting woe.
  Say, have you an arm like God,
    That you his will oppose?
  Fear you not that iron rod
    With which he breaks his foes?


Is the prayer of one that loves your souls.

EDMUND TURNER.

HAMILTON, June 22d, 1858, C.W.

To MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--A favorable opportunity affords the
pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of letters and papers;
certainly in this region they were highly appreciated, and I
hope the time may come that your kindness will be reciprocated
we are al well at present, but times continue dull. I also
deeply regret the excitement recently on the account of those
slaves, you will favor me by keeping me posted upon the subject.
Those words written to slaveholder is the thought of one who had
sufferd, and now I thought it a duty incumbent upon me to cry
aloud and spare not, &amp;c., by sending these few lines where the
slaveholder may hear. You will still further oblige your humble
servant also, to correct any inaccuracy. My respects to you and
your family and all inquiring friends.

Your friend and well wisher,

EDMUND TURNER.
</code></pre><p>The then impending judgments seen by an eye of faith as set forth in this &quot;Warning,&quot; soon fell with crushing weight upon the oppressor, and Slavery died. But the old blind father of Jackson, Isaac and Edmondson, still lives and may be seen daily on the streets of Philadelphia; and though &quot;halt, and lame, and blind, and poor,&quot; doubtless resulting from his early oppression, he can thank God and rejoice that he has lived to see Slavery abolished.</p><p>ROBERT BROWN, ALIAS THOMAS JONES.</p><p>CROSSING THE RIVER ON HORSEBACK IN THE NIGHT.</p><p>In very desperate straits many new inventions were sought after by deep-thinking and resolute slaves, determined to be free at any cost. But it must here be admitted, that, in looking carefully over the more perilous methods resorted to, Robert Brown, alias Thomas Jones, stands second to none, with regard to deeds of bold daring. This hero escaped from Martinsburg, Va., in 1856. He was a man of medium size, mulatto, about thirty-eight years of age, could read and write, and was naturally sharp-witted. He had formerly been owned by Col. John F. Franie, whom Robert charged with various offences of a serious domestic character.</p><p>Furthermore, he also alleged, that his &quot;mistress was cruel to all the slaves,&quot; declaring that &quot;they (the slaves), could not live with her,&quot; that &quot;she had to hire servants,&quot; etc.</p><p>In order to effect his escape, Robert was obliged to swim the Potomac river on horseback, on Christmas night, while the cold, wind, storm, and darkness were indescribably dismal. This daring bondman, rather than submit to his oppressor any longer, perilled his life as above stated. Where he crossed the river was about a half a mile wide. Where could be found in history a more noble and daring struggle for Freedom?</p><p>The wife of his bosom and his four children, only five days before he fled, were sold to a trader in Richmond, Va., for no other offence than simply &quot;because she had resisted&quot; the lustful designs of her master, being &quot;true to her own companion.&quot; After this poor slave mother and her children were cast into prison for sale, the husband and some of his friends tried hard to find a purchaser in the neighborhood; but the malicious and brutal master refused to sell her--wishing to gratify his malice to the utmost, and to punish his victims all that lay in his power, he sent them to the place above named.</p><p>In this trying hour, the severed and bleeding heart of the husband resolved to escape at all hazards, taking with him a daguerreotype likeness of his wife which he happened to have on hand, and a lock of hair from her head, and from each of the children, as mementoes of his unbounded (though sundered) affection for them.</p><p>After crossing the river, his wet clothing freezing to him, he rode all night, a distance of about forty miles. In the morning he left his faithful horse tied to a fence, quite broken down. He then commenced his dreary journey on foot--cold and hungry--in a strange place, where it was quite unsafe to make known his condition and wants. Thus for a day or two, without food or shelter, he traveled until his feet were literally worn out, and in this condition he arrived at Harrisburg, where he found friends. Passing over many of the interesting incidents on the road, suffice it to say, he arrived safely in this city, on New Year&#39;s night, 1857, about two hours before day break (the telegraph having announced his coming from Harrisburg), having been a week on the way. The night he arrived was very cold; besides, the Underground train, that morning, was about three hours behind time; in waiting for it, entirely out in the cold, a member of the Vigilance Committee thought he was frosted. But when he came to listen to the story of the Fugitive&#39;s sufferings, his mind changed.</p><p>Scarcely had Robert entered the house of one of the Committee, where he was kindly received, when he took from his pocket his wife&#39;s likeness, speaking very touchingly while gazing upon it and showing it. Subsequently, in speaking of his family, he showed the locks of hair referred to, which he had carefully rolled up in paper separately. Unrolling them, he said, &quot;this is my wife&#39;s;&quot; &quot;this is from my oldest daughter, eleven years old;&quot; &quot;and this is from my next oldest;&quot; &quot;and this from the next,&quot; &quot;and this from my infant, only eight weeks old.&quot; These mementoes he cherished with the utmost care as the last remains of his affectionate family. At the sight of these locks of hair so tenderly preserved, the member of the Committee could fully appreciate the resolution of the fugitive in plunging into the Potomac, on the back of a dumb beast, in order to flee from a place and people who had made such barbarous havoc in his household.</p><p>His wife, as represented by the likeness, was of fair complexion, prepossessing, and good looking--perhaps not over thirty-three years of age.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>ANTHONY LONEY, ALIAS WILLIAM ARMSTEAD.</p><p>Anthony had been serving under the yoke of Warring Talvert, of Richmond, Va. Anthony was of a rich black complexion, medium size, about twenty-five years of age. He was intelligent, and a member of the Baptist Church. His master was a member of the Presbyterian Church and held family prayers with the servants. But Anthony believed seriously, that his master was no more than a &quot;whitened sepulchre,&quot; one who was fond of saying, &quot;Lord, Lord,&quot; but did not do what the Lord bade him, consequently Anthony felt, that before the Great Judge his &quot;master&#39;s many prayers&quot; would not benefit him, as long as he continued to hold his fellow-men in bondage. He left a father, Samuel Loney, and mother, Rebecca also, one sister and four brothers. His old father had bought himself and was free; likewise his mother, being very old, had been allowed to go free. Anthony escaped in May, 1857.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

He stated that he had been claimed by Henry L. Brooke, whom he declared to be a &quot;hard drinker and a hard swearer.&quot; Cornelius had been very much bleached by the Patriarchal Institution, and he was shrewd enough to take advantage of this circumstance. In regions of country where men were less critical and less experienced than Southerners, as to how the bleaching process was brought about, Cornelius Scott would have had no difficulty whatever in passing for a white man of the most improved Anglo-Saxon type. Although a young man only twenty-three years of age, and quite stout, his fair complexion was decidedly against him. He concluded, that for this very reason, he would not have been valued at more than five hundred dollars in the market. He left his mother (Ann Stubbs, and half brother, Isaiah), and traveled as a white man.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

He escaped in March, 1857. He did not admit that he loved slavery any the better for the reason that his master was a preacher, or that his mistress was the wife of a preacher. Although a common farm hand, Samuel had common sense, and for a long time previous had been watching closely the conduct of his mistress, and at the same time had been laying his plans for escaping on the Underground Rail Road the first chance.</p><pre><code>$100 REWARD!--My negro man Richard has been missing since Sunday
night, March 22d. I will give $100 to any one who will secure
him or deliver him to me. Richard is thirty years old, but looks
older; very short legs, dark, but rather bright color, broad
cheek bones, a respectful and serious manner, generally looks
away when spoken to, small moustache and beard (but he may have
them off). He is a remarkably intelligent man, and can turn his
hand to anything. He took with him a bag made of Brussels
carpet, with my name written in large, rough letters on the
bottom, and a good stock of coarse and fine clothes, among them
a navy cap and a low-crowned hat. He has been seen about New
Kent C.H., and on the Pamunky river, and is no doubt trying to
get off in some vessel bound North.

J.W. RANDOLPH, Richmond, Va.

Even at this late date, it may perhaps afford Mr. R. a degree of
satisfaction to know what became of Richard; but if this should
not be the case, Richard&#39;s children, or mother, or father, if
they are living, may possibly see these pages, and thereby be
made glad by learning of Richard&#39;s wisdom as a traveler, in the
terrible days of slave-hunting. Consequently here is what was
recorded of him, April 3d, 1857, at the Underground Rail Road
Station, just before a free ticket was tendered him for Canada.
&quot;Richard is thirty-three years of age, small of stature, dark
color, smart and resolute. He was owned by Captain Tucker, of
the United States Navy, from whom he fled.&quot; He was &quot;tired of
serving, and wanted to marry,&quot; was the cause of his escape. He
had no complaint of bad treatment to make against his owner;
indeed he said, that he had been &quot;used well all his life.&quot;
Nevertheless, Richard felt that this Underground Rail Road was
the &quot;greatest road he ever saw.&quot;

When the war broke out, Richard girded on his knapsack and went
to help Uncle Sam humble Richmond and break the yoke.

</code></pre><p>BARNABY GRIGBY, ALIAS JOHN BOYER, AND MARY ELIZABETH, HIS WIFE; FRANK WANZER, ALIAS ROBERT SCOTT; EMILY FOSTER, ALIAS ANN WOOD.</p><p>(TWO OTHERS WHO STARTED WITH THEM WERE CAPTURED.)</p><p>All these persons journeyed together from Loudon Co., Va. on horseback and in a carriage for more than one hundred miles. Availing themselves of a holiday and their master&#39;s horses and carriage, they as deliberately started for Canada, as though they had never been taught that it was their duty, as servants, to &quot;obey their masters.&quot; In this particular showing a most utter disregard of the interest of their &quot;kind-hearted and indulgent owners.&quot; They left home on Monday, Christmas Eve, 1855, under the leadership of Frank Wanzer, and arrived in Columbia the following Wednesday at one o&#39;clock. As willfully as they had thus made their way along, they had not found it smooth sailing by any means. The biting frost and snow rendered their travel anything but agreeable. Nor did they escape the gnawings of hunger, traveling day and night. And whilst these &quot;articles&quot; were in the very act of running away with themselves and their kind master&#39;s best horses and carriage--when about one hundred miles from home, in the neighborhood of Cheat river, Maryland, they were attacked by &quot;six white men, and a boy,&quot; who, doubtless, supposing that their intentions were of a &quot;wicked and unlawful character&quot; felt it to be their duty in kindness to their masters, if not to the travelers to demand of them an account of themselves. In other words, the assailants positively commanded the fugitives to &quot;show what right&quot; they possessed, to be found in a condition apparently so unwarranted.</p><p>The <em>spokesman</em> amongst the fugitives, affecting no ordinary amount of dignity, told their assailants plainly, that &quot;no gentleman would interfere with persons riding along civilly&quot;--not allowing it to be supposed that they were slaves, of course. These &quot;gentlemen,&quot; however, were not willing to accept this account of the travelers, as their very decided steps indicated. Having the law on their side, they were for compelling the fugitives to surrender without further parley.</p><p>At this juncture, the fugitives verily believing that the time had arrived for the practical use of their pistols and dirks, pulled them out of their concealment--the young women as well as the young men--and declared they would not be &quot;taken!&quot; One of the white men raised his gun, pointing the muzzle directly towards one of the young women, with the threat that he would &quot;shoot,&quot; etc. &quot;Shoot! shoot!! shoot!!!&quot; she exclaimed, with a double barrelled pistol in one hand and a long dirk knife in the other, utterly unterrified and fully ready for a death struggle. The male <em>leader</em> of the fugitives by this time had &quot;pulled back the hammers&quot; of his &quot;pistols,&quot; and was about to fire! Their adversaries seeing the weapons, and the unflinching determination on the part of the <em>runaways</em> to stand their ground, &quot;spill blood, kill, or die,&quot; rather than be &quot;taken,&quot; very prudently &quot;sidled over to the other side of the road,&quot; leaving at least four of the victors to travel on their way.</p><p>At this moment the four in the carriage lost sight of the two on horseback. Soon after the separation they heard firing, but what the result was, they knew not. They were fearful, however, that their companions had been captured.</p><p>The following paragraph, which was shortly afterwards taken from a Southern paper, leaves no room to doubt, as to the fate of the two.</p><pre><code>Six fugitive slaves from Virginia were arrested at the Maryland
line, near Hood&#39;s Mill, on Christmas day, but, after a severe
fight, four of them escaped and have not since been heard of.
They came from Loudoun and Fauquier counties.

[Illustration: ]
</code></pre><p>Though the four who were successful, saw no &quot;severe fight,&quot; it is not unreasonable to suppose, that there was a fight, nevertheless; but not till after the number of the fugitives had been reduced to two, instead of six. As chivalrous as slave-holders and slave-catchers were, they knew the value of their precious lives and the fearful risk of attempting a capture, when the numbers were equal.</p><p>The party in the carriage, after the conflict, went on their way rejoicing.</p><p>The young men, one cold night, when they were compelled to take rest in the woods and snow, in vain strove to keep the feet of their female companions from freezing by lying on them; but the frost was merciless and bit them severely, as their feet very plainly showed. The following disjointed report was cut from the <em>Frederick (Md.) Examiner</em>, soon after the occurrence took place:</p><pre><code>&quot;Six slaves, four men and two women, fugitives from Virginia,
having with them two spring wagons and four horses, came to
Hood&#39;s Mill, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, near the
dividing line between Frederick and Carroll counties, on
Christmas day. After feeding their animals, one of them told a
Mr. Dixon whence they came; believing them to be fugitives, he
spread the alarm, and some eight or ten persons gathered round
to arrest them; but the negroes drawing revolvers and
bowie-knives, kept their assailants at bay, until five of the
party succeeded in escaping in one of the wagons, and as the
last one jumped on a horse to flee, he was fired at, the load
taking effect in the small of the back. The prisoner says he
belongs to Charles W. Simpson, Esq., of Fauquier county, Va.,
and ran away with the others on the preceding evening.&quot;
</code></pre><p>This report from the <em>Examiner</em>, while it is not wholly correct, evidently relates to the fugitives above described. Why the reporter made such glaring mistakes, may be accounted for on the ground that the bold stand made by the fugitives was so bewildering and alarming, that the &quot;assailants&quot; were not in a proper condition to make correct statements. Nevertheless the <em>Examiner&#39;s</em> report was preserved with other records, and is here given for what it is worth.</p><p>These victors were individually noted on the Record thus: Barnaby was owned by William Rogers, a farmer, who was considered a &quot;moderate slaveholder,&quot; although of late &quot;addicted to intemperance.&quot; He was the owner of about one &quot;dozen head of slaves,&quot; and had besides a wife and two children.</p><p>Barnaby&#39;s chances for making extra &quot;change&quot; for himself were never favorable; sometimes of &quot;nights&quot; he would manage to earn a &quot;trifle.&quot; He was prompted to escape because he &quot;wanted to live by the sweat of his own brow,&quot; believing that all men ought so to live. This was the only reason he gave for fleeing.</p><p>Mary Elizabeth had been owned by Townsend McVee (likewise a farmer), and in Mary&#39;s judgment, he was &quot;severe,&quot; but she added, &quot;his wife made him so.&quot; McVee owned about twenty-five slaves; &quot;he hardly allowed them to talk--would not allow them to raise chickens,&quot; and &quot;only allowed Mary three dresses a year;&quot; the rest she had to get as she could. Sometimes McVee would sell slaves--last year he sold two. Mary said that she could not say anything good of her mistress. On the contrary, she declared that her mistress &quot;knew no mercy nor showed any favor.&quot;</p><p>It was on account of this &quot;domineering spirit,&quot; that Mary was induced to escape.</p><p>Frank was owned by Luther Sullivan, &quot;the meanest man in Virginia,&quot; he said; he treated his people just as bad as he could in every respect. &quot;Sullivan,&quot; added Frank, &quot;would &#39;lowance the slaves and stint them to save food and get rich,&quot; and &quot;would sell and whip,&quot; etc. To Frank&#39;s knowledge, he had sold some twenty-five head. &quot;He sold my mother and her two children to Georgia some four years previous.&quot; But the motive which hurried Frank to make his flight was his laboring under the apprehension that his master had some &quot;pretty heavy creditors who might come on him at any time.&quot; Frank, therefore, wanted to be from home in Canada when these gentry should make their visit. My poor mother has been often flogged by master, said Frank. As to his mistress, he said she was &quot;tolerably good.&quot;</p><p>Ann Wood was owned by McVee also, and was own sister to Elizabeth. Ann very fully sustained her sister Elizabeth&#39;s statement respecting the character of her master.</p><p>The above-mentioned four, were all young and likely. Barnaby was twenty-six years of age, mulatto, medium size, and intelligent--his wife was about twenty-four years of age, quite dark, good-looking, and of pleasant appearance. Frank was twenty-five years of age, mulatto, and very smart; Ann was twenty-two, good-looking, and smart. After their pressing wants had been met by the Vigilance Committee, and after partial recuperation from their hard travel, etc., they were forwarded on to the Vigilance Committee in New York. In Syracuse, Frank (the leader), who was engaged to Emily, concluded that the knot might as well be tied on the U.G.R.R., although penniless, as to delay the matter a single day longer. Doubtless, the bravery, struggles, and trials of Emily throughout the journey, had, in his estimation, added not a little to her charms. Thus after consulting with her on the matter, her approval was soon obtained, she being too prudent and wise to refuse the hand of one who had proved himself so true a friend to Freedom, as well as so devoted to her. The twain were accordingly made one at the U.G.R.R. Station, in Syracuse, by Superintendent--Rev. J.W. Loguen. After this joyful event, they proceeded to Toronto, and were there gladly received by the Ladies&#39; Society for aiding colored refugees.</p><p>The following letter from Mrs. Agnes Willis, wife of the distinguished Rev. Dr. Willis, brought the gratifying intelligence that these brave young adventurers, fell into the hands of distinguished characters and warm friends of Freedom:</p><pre><code>TORONTO, 28th January, Monday evening, 1856.

MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I have very great pleasure in making you
aware that the following respectable persons have arrived here
in safety without being annoyed in any way after you saw them.
The women, two of them, viz: Mrs. Greegsby and Mrs. Graham, have
been rather ailing, but we hope they will very soon be well.
They have been attended to by the Ladies&#39; Society, and are most
grateful for any attention they have received. The solitary
person, Mrs. Graves, has also been attended to; also her box
will be looked after. She is pretty well, but rather dull;
however, she will get friends and feel more at home by and bye.
Mrs. Wanzer is quite well; and also young William Henry
Sanderson. They are all of them in pretty good spirits, and I
have no doubt they will succeed in whatever business they take
up. In the mean time the men are chopping wood, and the ladies
are getting plenty sewing. We are always glad to see our colored
refugees safe here. I remain, dear sir,

yours respectfully,

AGNES WILLIS,

Treasurer to the Ladies&#39; Society to aid colored refugees.
</code></pre><p>For a time Frank enjoyed his newly won freedom and happy bride with bright prospects all around; but the thought of having left sisters and other relatives in bondage was a source of sadness in the midst of his joy. He was not long, however, in making up his mind that he would deliver them or &quot;die in the attempt.&quot; Deliberately forming his plans to go South, he resolved to take upon himself the entire responsibility of all the risks to be encountered. Not a word did he reveal to a living soul of what he was about to undertake. With &quot;twenty-two dollars&quot; in cash and &quot;three pistols&quot; in his pockets, he started in the lightning train from Toronto for Virginia. On reaching Columbia in this State, he deemed it not safe to go any further by public conveyance, consequently he commenced his long journey on foot, and as he neared the slave territory he traveled by night altogether. For two weeks, night and day, he avoided trusting himself in any house, consequently was compelled to lodge in the woods. Nevertheless, during that space of time he succeeded in delivering one of his sisters and her husband, and another friend in the bargain. You can scarcely imagine the Committee&#39;s amazement on his return, as they looked upon him and listened to his &quot;noble deeds of daring&quot; and his triumph. A more brave and self-possessed man they had never seen.</p><p>He knew what Slavery was and the dangers surrounding him on his mission, but possessing true courage unlike most men, he pictured no alarming difficulties in a distance of nearly one thousand miles by the mail route, through the enemy&#39;s country, where he might have in truth said, &quot;I could not pass without running the gauntlet of mobs and assassins, prisons and penitentiaries, bailiffs and constables, &amp;c.&quot; If this hero had dwelt upon and magnified the obstacles in his way he would most assuredly have kept off the enemy&#39;s country, and his sister and friends would have remained in chains.</p><p>The following were the persons delivered by Frank Wanzer. They were his trophies, and this noble act of Frank&#39;s should ever be held as a memorial and honor. The Committee&#39;s brief record made on their arrival runs thus:</p><p>&quot;August 18, 1856. Frank Wanzer, Robert Stewart, alias Gasberry Robison, Vincent Smith, alias John Jackson, Betsey Smith, wife of Vincent Smith, alias Fanny Jackson. They all came from Alder, Loudon county, Virginia.&quot;</p><p>Robert is about thirty years of age, medium size, dark chestnut color, intelligent and resolute. He was held by the widow Hutchinson, who was also the owner of about one hundred others. Robert regarded her as a &quot;very hard mistress&quot; until the death of her husband, which took place the Fall previous to his escape. That sad affliction, he thought, was the cause of a considerable change in her treatment of her slaves. But yet &quot;nothing was said about freedom,&quot; on her part. This reticence Robert understood to mean, that she was still unconverted on this great cardinal principle at least. As he could see no prospect of freedom through her agency, when Frank approached him with a good report from Canada and his friends there, he could scarcely wait to listen to the glorious news; he was so willing and anxious to get out of slavery. His dear old mother, Sarah Davis, and four brothers and two sisters, William, Thomas, Frederick and Samuel, Violet and Ellen, were all owned by Mrs. Hutchinson. Dear as they were to him, he saw no way to take them with him, nor was he prepared to remain a day longer under the yoke; so he decided to accompany Frank, let the cost be what it might.</p><p>Vincent is about twenty-three years of age, very &quot;likely-looking,&quot; dark color, and more than ordinarily intelligent for one having only the common chances of slaves.</p><p>He was owned by the estate of Nathan Skinner, who was &quot;looked upon,&quot; by those who knew him, &quot;as a good slave-holder.&quot; In slave property, however, he was only interested to the number of twelve head. Skinner &quot;neither sold nor emancipated.&quot; A year and a half before Vincent escaped, his master was called to give an account of his stewardship, and there in the spirit land Vincent was willing to let him remain, without much more to add about him.</p><p>Vincent left his mother, Judah Smith, and brothers and sisters, Edwin, Angeline, Sina Ann, Adaline Susan, George, John and Lewis, all belonging to the estate of Skinner.</p><p>Vincent was fortunate enough to bring his wife along with him. She was about twenty-seven years of age, of a brown color, and smart, and was owned by the daughter of the widow Hutchinson. This mistress was said to be a &quot;clever woman.&quot;</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>WILLIAM JORDON, ALIAS WILLIAM PRICE</p><p>Under Governor Badger, of North Carolina, William had experienced Slavery in its most hateful form. True, he had only been twelve months under the yoke of this high functionary. But William&#39;s experience in this short space of time, was of a nature very painful.</p><p>Previous to coming into the governor&#39;s hands, William was held as the property of Mrs. Mary Jordon, who owned large numbers of slaves. Whether the governor was moved by this consideration, or by the fascinating charms of Mrs. Jordon, or both, William was not able to decide. But the governor offered her his hand, and they became united in wedlock. By this circumstance, William was brought into his unhappy relations with the Chief Magistrate of the State of North Carolina. This was the third time the governor had been married. Thus it may be seen, that the governor was a firm believer in wives as well as slaves. Commonly he was regarded as a man of wealth. William being an intelligent piece of property, his knowledge of the governor&#39;s rules and customs was quite complete, as he readily answered such questions as were propounded to him. In this way a great amount of interesting information was learned from William respecting the governor, slaves, on the plantation, in the swamps, etc. The governor owned large plantations, and was interested in raising cotton, corn, and peas, and was also a practical planter. He was willing to trust neither overseers nor slaves any further than he could help.</p><p>The governor and his wife were both equally severe towards them; would stint them shamefully in clothing and food, though they did not get flogged quite as often as some others on neighboring plantations. Frequently, the governor would be out on the plantation from early in the morning till noon, inspecting the operations of the overseers and slaves.</p><p>In order to serve the governor, William had been separated from his wife by sale, which was the cause of his escape. He parted not with his companion willingly. At the time, however, he was promised that he should have some favors shown him;--could make over-work, and earn a little money, and once or twice in the year, have the opportunity of making visits to her. Two hundred miles was the distance between them.</p><p>He had not been long on the governor&#39;s plantation before his honor gave him distinctly to understand that the idea of his going two hundred miles to see his wife was all nonsense, and entirely out of the question. &quot;If I said so, I did not mean it,&quot; said his honor, when the slave, on a certain occasion, alluded to the conditions on which he consented to leave home, etc.</p><p>Against this cruel decision of the governor, William&#39;s heart revolted, for he was warmly attached to his wife, and so he made up his mind, if he could not see her &quot;once or twice a year even,&quot; as he had been promised, he had rather &quot;die,&quot; or live in a &quot;cave in the wood,&quot; than to remain all his life under the governor&#39;s yoke. Obeying the dictates of his feelings, he went to the woods. For ten months before he was successful in finding the Underground Road, this brave-hearted young fugitive abode in the swamps--three months in a cave--surrounded with bears, wild cats, rattle-snakes and the like.</p><p>While in the swamps and cave, he was not troubled, however, about ferocious animals and venomous reptiles. He feared only man!</p><p>From his own story there was no escaping the conclusion, that if the choice had been left to him, he would have preferred at any time to have encountered at the mouth of his cave a ferocious bear than his master, the governor of North Carolina. How he managed to subsist, and ultimately effected his escape, was listened to with the deepest interest, though the recital of these incidents must here be very brief.</p><p>After night he would come out of his cave, and, in some instances, would succeed in making his way to a plantation, and if he could get nothing else, he would help himself to a &quot;pig,&quot; or anything else he could conveniently convert into food. Also, as opportunity would offer, a friend of his would favor him with some meal, etc. With this mode of living he labored to content himself until he could do better. During these ten months he suffered indescribable hardships, but he felt that his condition in the cave was far preferable to that on the plantation, under the control of his Excellency, the Governor. All this time, however, William had a true friend, with whom he could communicate; one who was wide awake, and was on the alert to find a reliable captain from the North, who would consent to take this &quot;property,&quot; or &quot;freight,&quot; for a consideration. He heard at last of a certain Captain, who was then doing quite a successful business in an Underground way. This good news was conveyed to William, and afforded him a ray of hope in the wilderness. As Providence would have it, his hope did not meet with disappointment; nor did his ten months&#39; trial, warring against the barbarism of Slavery, seem too great to endure for Freedom. He was about to leave his cave and his animal and reptile neighbors,--his heart swelling with gladness,--but the thought of soon being beyond the reach of his mistress and master thrilled him with inexpressible delight. He was brought away by Captain F., and turned over to the Committee, who were made to rejoice with him over the signal victory he had gained in his martyr-like endeavors to throw off the yoke, and of course they took much pleasure in aiding him. William was of a dark color, stout made physically, and well knew the value of Freedom, and how to hate and combat Slavery. It will be seen by the appended letter of Thomas Garrett, that William had the good luck to fall into the hands of this tried friend, by whom he was aided to Philadelphia:</p><pre><code>WILMINGTON, 12th mo., 19th, 1855.

DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--The bearer of this is one of the
twenty-one that I thought had all gone North; he left home on
Christmas day, one year since, wandered about the forests of
North Carolina for about ten months, and then came here with
those forwarded to New Bedford, where he is anxious to go. I
have furnished him with a pretty good pair of boots, and gave
him money to pay his passage to Philadelphia. He has been at
work in the country near here for some three weeks, till taken
sick; he is, by no means, well, but thinks he had better try to
get farther North, which I hope his friends in Philadelphia will
aid him to do. I handed this morning Captain Lambson&#39;s[A] wife
twenty dollars to help fee a lawyer to defend him. She leaves
this morning, with her child, for Norfolk, to be at the trial
before the Commissioner on the 24th instant. Passmore Williamson
agreed to raise fifty dollars for him. As none came to hand, and
a good chance to send it by his wife, I thought best to advance
that much.

[Footnote A: Captain Lambson had been suspected of having aided
in the escape of slaves from the neighborhood of Norfolk, and
was in prison awaiting his trial.]

Thy friend,

THOS. GARRETT.
</code></pre><p>JOSEPH GRANT AND JOHN SPEAKS.</p><p>TWO PASSENGERS ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD, VIA LIVERPOOL.</p><p>It is to be regretted that, owing to circumstances, the account of these persons has not been fully preserved. Could justice be done them, probably their narratives would not be surpassed in interest by any other in the history of fugitives. In 1857, when these remarkable travelers came under the notice of the Vigilance Committee, as Slavery seemed likely to last for generations, and there was but little expectation that these records would ever have the historical value which they now possess, care was not always taken to prepare and preserve them. Besides, the cases coming under the notice of the Committee, were so numerous and so interesting, that it seemed almost impossible to do them anything like justice. In many instances the rapt attention paid by friends, when listening to the sad recitals of such passengers, would unavoidably consume so much time that but little opportunity was afforded to make any record of them. Particularly was this the case with regard to the above-mentioned individuals. The story of each was so long and sad, that a member of the Committee in attempting to write it out, found that the two narratives would take volumes. That all traces, of these heroes might not be lost, a mere fragment is all that was preserved.</p><p>The original names of these adventurers, were Joseph Grant and John Speaks. Between two and three years before escaping, they were sold from Maryland to John B. Campbell a negro trader, living in Baltimore, and thence to Campbell&#39;s brother, another trader in New Orleans, and subsequently to Daniel McBeans and Mr. Henry, of Harrison county, Mississippi.</p><p>Though both had to pass through nearly the same trial, and belonged to the same masters, this recital must be confined chiefly to the incidents in the career of Joseph. He was about twenty-seven years of age, well made, quite black, intelligent and self-possessed in his manner.</p><p>He was owned in Maryland by Mrs. Mary Gibson, who resided at St. Michael&#39;s on the Eastern Shore. She was a <em>nice woman</em> he said, but her property was under mortgage and had to be sold, and he was in danger of sharing the same fate.</p><p>Joseph was a married man, and spoke tenderly of his wife. She &quot;promised&quot; him when he was sold that she would &quot;never marry,&quot; and earnestly entreated him, if he &quot;ever met with the luck, to come and see her.&quot; She was unaware perhaps at that time of the great distance that was to divide them; his feelings on being thus sundered need not be stated. However, he had scarcely been in Mississippi three weeks, ere his desire to return to his wife, and the place of his nativity constrained him to attempt to return; accordingly he set off, crossing a lake eighty miles wide in a small boat, he reached Kent Island. There he was captured by the watchman on the Island, who with <em>pistols, dirk and cutlass</em> in hand, threatened if he resisted that death would be his instant doom. Of course he was returned to his master.</p><p>He remained there a few months, but could content himself no longer to endure the ills of his condition. So he again started for home, walked to Mobile, and thence he succeeded in stowing himself away in a steamboat and was thus conveyed to Montgomery, a distance of five hundred and fifty miles through solid slave territory. Again he was captured and returned to his owners; one of whom always went for immediate punishment, the other being mild thought persuasion the better plan in such cases. On the whole, Joseph thus far had been pretty fortunate, considering the magnitude of his offence.</p><p>A third time he summoned courage and steered his course homewards towards Maryland, but as in the preceding attempts, he was again unsuccessful.</p><p>In this instance Mr. Henry, the harsh owner, was exasperated, and the mild one&#39;s patience so exhausted that they concluded that nothing short of stern measures would cause Joe to reform. Said Mr. Henry; &quot;<em>I had rather lose my right arm than for him to get off without being punished, after having put us to so much trouble</em>.&quot;</p><p><em>Joseph</em> will now speak for himself.</p><p>&quot;He (master) sent the overseer to tie me. I told him I would not be tied. I ran and stayed away four days, which made Mr. Henry very anxious. Mr. Beans told the servants if they saw me, to tell me to come back and I should not be hurt. Thinking that Mr. Beans had always stood to his word, I was over persuaded and came back. He sent for me in his parlor, talked the matter over, sent me to the steamboat (perhaps the one he tried to escape on.) After getting cleverly on board the captain told me, I am sorry to tell you, you have to be tied. I was tied and Mr. Henry was sent for. He came; &#39;Well, I have got you at last, beg my pardon and promise you will never run away again and I will not be so hard on you.&#39; I could not do it. He then gave me three hundred lashes well laid on. I was stripped entirely naked, and my flesh was as raw as a piece of beef. He made John (the companion who escaped with him) hold one of my feet which I broke loose while being whipped, and when done made him bathe me in salt and water.</p><p>&quot;Then I resolved to &#39;go or die&#39; in the attempt. Before starting, one week, I could not work. On getting better we went to Ship Island; the sailors, who were Englishmen, were very sorry to hear of the treatment we had received, and counselled us how we might get free.&quot;</p><p>The counsel was heeded, and in due time they found themselves in Liverpool. There their stay was brief. Utterly destitute of money, education, and in a strange land, they very naturally turned their eyes again in the direction of their native land. Accordingly their host, the keeper of a sailor&#39;s boarding-house, shipped them to Philadelphia.</p><p>But to go back, Joseph saw many things in New Orleans and Mississippi of a nature too horrible to relate, among which were the following:</p><p>I have seen Mr. Beans whip one of his slaves to death, at the tree to which he was tied.</p><p>Mr. Henry would make them lie down across a log, stripped naked, and with every stroke would lay the flesh open. Being used to it, some would lie on the log without being tied.</p><p>In New Orleans, I have seen women stretched out just as naked as my hand, on boxes, and given one hundred and fifty lashes, four men holding them. I have helped hold them myself: when released they could hardly sit or walk. This whipping was at the &quot;<em>Fancy House</em>.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;chain-gangs&quot; he also saw in constant operation. Four and five slaves chained together and at work on the streets, cleaning, &amp;c., was a common sight. He could hardly tell Sunday from Monday in New Orleans, the slaves were kept so constantly going.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

June 8th &amp;c2t--

_Richmond Enquirer, June 9, 57_.
</code></pre><p>William unquestionably possessed a fair share of common sense, and just enough distaste to Slavery to arouse him most resolutely to seek his freedom.</p><p>The advertisement of James G. Tyler was not altogether accurate with regard to his description of William; but notwithstanding, in handing William down to posterity, the description of Tyler has been adopted instead of the one engrossed in the records by the Committee. But as a simple matter of fair play, it seems fitting, that the description given by William, while on the Underground Rail Road, of his master, &amp;c., should come in just here.</p><p>William acknowledged that he was the property of Walter H. Tyler, brother of EX-PRESIDENT TYLER, who was described as follows: &quot;He (master) was about sixty-five years of age; was a barbarous man, very intemperate, horse racer, chicken-cock fighter and gambler. He had owned as high as forty head of slaves, but he had gambled them all away. He was a doctor, circulated high amongst southerners, though he never lived agreeably with his wife, would curse her and call her all kinds of names that he should not call a lady. From a boy of nine up to the time I was fifteen or sixteen, I don&#39;t reckon he whipped me less than a hundred times. He shot at me once with a double-barrelled gun.</p><p>&quot;What made me leave was because I worked for him all my life-time and he never gave me but two dollars and fifteen cents in all his life. I was hired out this year for two hundred dollars, but when I would go to him to make complaints of hard treatment from the man I was hired to, he would say: &quot;G----d d----n it, don&#39;t come to me, all I want is my money.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mr. Tyler was a thin raw-boned man, with a long nose, the picture of the president. His wife was a tolerably well-disposed woman in some instances--she was a tall, thin-visaged woman, and stood high in the community. Through her I fell into the hands of Tyler. At present she owns about fifty slaves. His own slaves, spoken of as having been gambled away, came by his father--he has been married the second time.&quot;</p><p>Twice William had been sold and bought in, on account of his master&#39;s creditors, and for many months had been expecting to be sold again, to meet pressing claims in the hands of the sheriff against Tyler. He, by the way, &quot;now lives in Hanover county, about eighteen miles from Richmond, and for fear of the sheriff, makes himself very scarce in that city.&quot;</p><p>At fourteen years of age, William was sold for eight hundred dollars; he would have brought in 1857, probably twelve hundred and fifty dollars; he was a member of the Baptist Church in good and regular standing.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

To keep from being sold, she was prompted to try her fortune on the U.G.R.R., for Freedom in Canada, under the protection of the British Lion.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Fled from near Frederick, Md., from the clutches of a farmer by the name of William Dorsey, who was described as a severe master, and had sold two of Jacob&#39;s sisters, South, only three years prior to his escape. Jacob left three brothers in chains.</p><p>Alfred is twenty-three years of age, in stature quite small, full black, and bears the marks of ill usage. Though a member of the Methodist Church, his master, Fletcher Jackson, &quot;thought nothing of taking the shovel to Alfred&#39;s head; or of knocking him, and stamping his head with the heels of his boots.&quot; Repeatedly, of late, he had been shockingly beaten. To escape those terrible visitations, therefore, he made up his mind to seek a refuge in Canada.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

LEE, ALIAS THOMAS BUSHIER.</p><p>Six very clever-looking passengers, all in one party from Baltimore, Md., the first Sunday in April, 1853. Baltimore used to be in the days of Slavery one of the most difficult places in the South for even free colored people to get away from, much more for slaves. The rule forbade any colored person leaving there by rail road or steamboat, without such applicant had been weighed, measured, and then given a bond signed by unquestionable signatures, well known. Baltimore was rigid in the extreme, and was a never-failing source of annoyance, trouble and expense to colored people generally, and not unfrequently to slave-holders too, when they were traveling North with &quot;colored servants.&quot; Just as they were ready to start, the &quot;Rules&quot; would forbid colored servants until the law was complied with. Parties hurrying on would on account of this obstruction &quot;have to wait until their hurry was over.&quot; As this was all done in the interest of Slavery, the matter was not very loudly condemned. But, notwithstanding all this weighing, measuring and requiring of bonds, many travelers by the Underground Rail Road took passage from Baltimore.</p><p>The enterprising individual, whose name stands at the head of this narrative, came directly from this stronghold of Slavery. The widow Pipkins held the title deed for Jefferson. She was unfortunate in losing him, as she was living in ease and luxury off of Jefferson&#39;s sweat and labor. Louisa, Harriet and Grace owed service to Geo. Stewart of Baltimore; Edward was owned by Chas. Moondo, and Chas. Lee by the above Stewart.</p><p>Those who would have taken this party for stupid, or for know-nothings, would have found themselves very much mistaken. Indeed they were far from being dull or sleepy on the subject of Slavery at any rate. They had considered pretty thoroughly how wrongfully they, with all others in similar circumstances, had been year in and year out subjected to unrequited toil so resolved to leave masters and mistresses to shift for themselves, while they would try their fortunes in Canada.</p><p>Four of the party ranged in age from twenty to twenty-eight years of age, and the other two from thirty-seven to forty. The Committee on whom they called, rendered them due aid and advice, and forwarded them to the Committee in New York.</p><p>The following letter from Jefferson, appealing for assistance on behalf of his children in Slavery, was peculiarly touching, as were all similar letters. But the mournful thought that these appeals, sighs, tears and prayers would continue in most cases to be made till death, that nothing could be done directly for the deliverance of such sufferers was often as painful as the escape from the auction block was gratifying.</p><p>LETTER FROM JEFFERSON PIPKINS.</p><pre><code>Sept. 28, 1856.

To WM. STILL. SIR:--I take the liberty of writing to you a few
lines concerning my children, for I am very anxious to get them
and I wish you to please try what you can do for me. Their names
are Charles and Patrick and are living with Mrs. Joseph G. Wray
Murphysborough Hartford county, North Carolina; Emma lives with
a Lawyer Baker in Gatesville North Carolina and Susan lives in
Portsmouth Virginia and is stopping with Dr. Collins sister a
Mrs. Nash you can find her out by enquiring for Dr. Collins at
the ferry boat at Portsmouth, and Rose a coloured woman at the
Crawford House can tell where she is. And I trust you will try
what you think will be the best way. And you will do me a great
favour.

Yours Respectfully,

JEFFERSON PIPKINS.

P.S. I am living at Yorkville near Toronto Canada West. My wife
sends her best respects to Mrs. Still.

</code></pre><p>SEVERAL ARRIVALS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES.</p><p>In order to economize time and space, with a view to giving an account of as many of the travelers as possible, it seems expedient, where a number of arrivals come in close proximity to each other, to report them briefly, under one head.</p><p>Henry Anderson, <em>alias</em> WILLIAM ANDERSON. In outward appearance Henry was uninteresting. As he asserted, and as his appearance indicated, he had experienced a large share of &quot;rugged&quot; usage. Being far in the South, and in the hands of a brutal &quot;Captain of a small boat,&quot; chances of freedom or of moderate treatment, had rarely ever presented themselves in any aspect. On the 3d of the preceding March he was sold to a negro trader--the thought of having to live under a trader was so terrible, he was moved to escape, leaving his wife, to whom he had only been married three months. Henry was twenty-five years of age, quite black and a little below the medium size.</p><p>He fled from Beaufort, North Carolina. The system of slavery in all the region of country whence Henry came, exhibited generally great brutality and cruelty.</p><p>CHARLES CONGO AND WIFE, MARGARET. Charles and his wife were fortunate in managing to flee together. Their attachment to each other was evidently true. They were both owned by a farmer, who went by the name of David Stewart, and resided in Maryland. As Charles&#39; owner did not require their services at home, as he had more of that kind of stock than he had use for--he hired them out to another farmer--Charles for $105 per annum; how much for the wife they could not tell. She, however, was not blessed with good health, though she was not favored any more on that account. Charles&#39; affection for his wife, on seeing how hard she had to labor when not well, aroused him to seek their freedom by flight. He resolved to spare no pains, to give himself no rest until they were both free. Accordingly the Underground Rail Road was sought and found. Charles was twenty-eight, with a good head and striking face, as well as otherwise well made; chestnut color and intelligent, though unable to read. Left two sisters in bondage. Margaret was about the same age as her husband, a nice-looking brown-skinned woman; worth $500. Charles was valued at $1200.</p><p>The atmosphere throughout the neighborhood where Charles and Margaret had lived and breathed, and had their existence, was heavily oppressed with slavery. No education for the freeman of color, much less for the slave. The order of the day was literally, as far as colored men were concerned: &quot;No rights which white men were bound to respect.&quot;</p><p>Chaskey Brown, Wm. Henry Washington, James Alfred Frisley, and Charles Henry Salter. Chaskey is about twenty-four years of age, quite black, medium size, sound body and intelligent appearance, nevertheless he resembled a &quot;farm hand&quot; in every particular. His master was known by the name of Major James H. Gales, and he was the owner of a farm with eighteen men, women and children, slaves to toil for him. The Major in disposition was very abusive and profane, though old and grey-headed. His wife was pretty much the same kind of a woman as he was a man; one who delighted in making the slaves tremble at her bidding. Chaskey was a member of the &quot;Still Pond church,&quot; of Kent county, Md. Often Chaskey was made to feel the lash on his back, notwithstanding his good standing in the church. He had a wife and one child. In escaping, he was obliged to leave them both. Chaskey was valued at $1200.</p><p>William Henry was about 20 years of age, and belonged to Doctor B. Grain, of Baltimore, who hired him out to a farmer. Not relishing the idea of having to work all his life in bondage, destitute of all privileges, he resolved to seek a refuge in Canada. He left his mother, four sisters and two brothers.</p><p>James is twenty-four years of age, well made, quite black and pretty shrewd. He too was unable to see how it was that he should be worked, and flogged, and sold, at the pleasure of his master and &quot;getting nothing;&quot; he &quot;had rather work for himself.&quot; His master was a &quot;<em>speckled-faced--pretty large stomach man</em>, but was not very abuseful.&quot; He only owned one other.</p><p>Charles Henry is about thirty years of age, of good proportion, nice-looking and intelligent; but to rough usage he was no stranger. To select his own master was a privilege not allowed; privileges of all kinds were rare with him. So he resolved to flee. Left his mother, three sisters and five brothers in slavery. He was a member of &quot;Albany Chapel,&quot; at Massey&#39;s Cross Roads, and a slave of Dr. B. Crain. Charles left his wife Anna, living near the head of Sassafras, Md. The separation was painful, as was everything belonging to the system of Slavery.</p><p>These were all gladly received by the Vigilance Committee, and the hand of friendship warmly extended to them; and the best of counsel and encouragement was offered; material aid, food and clothing were also furnished as they had need, and they were sent on their way rejoicing to Canada.</p><p>Stephen Taylor, Charles Brown, Charles Henry Hollis, and Luther Dorsey. Stephen was a fine young man, of twenty years of age; he fled to keep from being sold. He &quot;supposed his master wanted money.&quot; His master was a &quot;tall, spare-faced man, with long whiskers, very wicked and very quick-tempered,&quot; and was known by the name of James Smithen, of Sandy Hook, Harford county, Md. His wife was also a very &quot;close woman.&quot; They had four children growing up to occupy their places as oppressors. Stephen was not satisfied to serve either old or young masters any longer, and made up his mind to leave the first opportunity. Before this watchful and resolute purpose the way opened, and he soon found it comparatively easy to find his way from Maryland to Pennsylvania, and likewise into the hands of the Vigilance Committee, to whom he made known fully the character of the place and people whence he had fled, the dangers he was exposed to from slave-hunters, and the strong hope he cherished of reaching free land soon. Being a young man of promise, Stephen was advised earnestly to apply his mind to seek an education, and to use every possible endeavor to raise himself in the scale of manhood, morally, religiously and intellectually; and he seemed to drink in the admonitions thus given with a relish. After recruiting, and all necessary arrangements had been made for his comfort and passage to Canada, he was duly forwarded. &quot;One more slave-holder is minus another slave worth at least $1200, which is something to rejoice over,&quot; said Committee. Stephen&#39;s parents were dead; one brother was the only near relative he left in chains.</p><p>Charles Brown was about twenty-five years of age, quite black, and bore the marks of having been used hard, though his stout and hearty appearance would have rendered him very desirable to a trader. He fled from William Wheeling, of Sandy Hook, Md. He spoke of his master as a &quot;pretty bad man,&quot; who was &quot;always quarreling,&quot; and &quot;would drink, swear and lie.&quot; Left simply because he &quot;never got anything for his labor.&quot; On taking his departure for Canada, he was called upon to bid adieu to his mother and three brothers, all under the yoke. His master he describes thus--</p><p>&quot;His face was long, cheek-bones high, middling tall, and about twenty-six years of age.&quot; With this specimen of humanity, Charles was very much dissatisfied, and he made up his mind not to stand the burdens of Slavery a day longer than he could safely make his way to the North. And in making an effort to reach Canada, he was quite willing to suffer many things. So the first chance Charles got, he started, and Providence smiled upon his resolution; he found himself a joyful passenger on the Underground Rail Road, being entertained free, and receiving attentions from the Company all along the line through to her British Majesty&#39;s boundlessly free territory in the Canadas.</p><p>True, the thought of his mother and brothers, left in the prison house, largely marred his joy, as it did also the Committee&#39;s, still the Committee felt that Charles had gained his Freedom honorably, and at the same time, had left his master a poorer, if not a wiser man, by at least $1200.</p><p>Charles Henry was a good-looking young man, only twenty years of age, and appeared to possess double as much natural sense as he would require to take care of himself. John Webster of Sandy Hook, claimed Charles&#39; time, body and mind, and this was what made Charles unhappy. Uneducated as he was, he was too sensible to believe that Webster had any God-given right to his manhood. Consequently, he left because his master &quot;did not treat him right.&quot; Webster was a tall man, with large black whiskers, about forty years of age, and owned Charles&#39; two sisters. Charles was sorry for the fate of his sisters, but he could not help them if he remained. Staying to wear the yoke, he felt would rather make it worse instead of better for all concerned.</p><p>Luther Dorsey is about nineteen years of age, rather smart, black, well made and well calculated for a Canadian. He was prompted to escape purely from the desire to be &quot;<em>free</em>.&quot; He fled from a &quot;very insulting man,&quot; by the name of Edward Schriner, from the neighborhood of Sairsville Mills, Frederick Co., Md. This Schriner was described as a &quot;low chunky man, with grum look, big mouth, etc.,&quot; and was a member of the German Reformed Church. &quot;Don&#39;t swear, though might as well; he was so bad other ways.&quot;</p><p>Luther was a member of the Methodist church at Jones Hill. Left his father in chains; his mother had wisely escaped to Canada years back, when he was but a boy. Where she was then, he could not tell, but hoped to meet her in Canada.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND.</p><p>JEREMIAH W. SMITH AND WIFE JULIA.</p><p>Richmond was a city noted for its activity and enterprise in slave trade. Several slave pens and prisons were constantly kept up to accommodate the trade. And slave auctions were as common in Richmond as dress goods auctions in Philadelphia; notwithstanding this fact, strange as it may seem, the Underground Rail Road brought away large numbers of passengers from Richmond, Petersburg and Norfolk, and not a few of them lived comparatively within a hair&#39;s breadth of the auction block. Many of those from these localities were amongst the most intelligent and respectable slaves in the South, and except at times when disheartened by some grave disaster which had befallen the road, as, for instance, when some friendly captain or conductor was discovered in aiding fugitives, many of the thinking bondmen were daily manoeuvering and watching for opportunities to escape or aid their friends so to do. This state of things of course made the naturally hot blood of Virginians fairly boil. They had preached long and loudly about the contented and happy condition of the slaves,--that the chief end of the black man was to worship and serve the white man, with joy and delight, with more willingness and obedience indeed than he would be expected to serve his Maker. So the slave-holders were utterly at a loss to account for the unnatural desire on the part of the slaves to escape to the North where they affirmed they would be far less happy in freedom than in the hands of those so &quot;kind and indulgent towards them.&quot; Despite all this, daily the disposition increased, with the more intelligent slaves, to distrust the statements of their masters especially when they spoke against the North. For instance if the master was heard to curse Boston the slave was then satisfied that Boston was just the place he would like to go to; or if the master told the slave that the blacks in Canada were freezing and starving to death by hundreds, his hope of trying to reach Canada was made tenfold stronger; he was willing to risk all the starving and freezing that the country could afford; his eagerness to find a conductor then would become almost painful.</p><p>The situations of Jeremiah and Julia Smith, however, were not considered very hard, indeed they had fared rather better than most slaves in Virginia, nevertheless it will be seen that they desired to better their condition, to keep off of the auction-block at least. Jeremiah could claim to have no mixture in his blood, as his color was of such a pure black; but with the way of the world, in respect to shrewdness and intelligence, he had evidently been actively conversant. He was about twenty-six years of age, and in stature only medium, with poor health.</p><p>The name of James Kinnard, whom he was obliged to call master and serve, was disgusting to him. Kinnard, he said, was a &quot;close and severe man.&quot; At the same time he was not considered by the community &quot;a hard man.&quot; From the age of fifteen years Jeremiah had been hired out, for which his owner had received from $50 to $130 per annum. In consequence of his master&#39;s custom of thus letting out Jeremiah, the master had avoided doctors&#39; bills, &amp;c. For the last two years prior to his escape, however, Jeremiah&#39;s health had been very treacherous, in consequence of which the master had been compelled to receive only $50 a year, sick or well. About one month before Jeremiah left, he was to have been taken on his master&#39;s farm, with the hope that he could be made more profitable there than he was in being hired out.</p><p>His owner had thought once of selling him, perhaps fearing that Jeremiah might unluckily die on his hands. So he put him in prison and advertised; but as he had the asthma pretty badly at that time, he was not saleable, the traders even declined to buy him.</p><p>While these troubles were presenting themselves to Jeremiah, Julia, his wife, was still more seriously involved, which added to Jeremiah&#39;s perplexities, of course.</p><p>Julia was of a dark brown color, of medium size, and thirty years of age. Fourteen years she had been the slave of A. Judson Crane, and under him she had performed the duties of nurse, chamber-maid, etc., &quot;faithfully and satisfactorily,&quot; as the certificate furnished her by this owner witnessed. She actually possessing a certificate, which he, Crane, gave her to enable her to find a new master, as she was then about to be sold. Her master had experienced a failure in business. This was the reason why she was to be sold.</p><p>Mrs. Crane, her mistress, had always promised Julia that she should be free at her death. But, unexpectedly, as Mrs. Crane was on her journey home from Cape May, where she had been for her health the summer before Julia escaped, she died suddenly in Philadelphia. Julia, however, had been sold twice before her mistress&#39; death; once to the trader, Reed, and afterwards to John Freeland, and again was on the eve of being sold. Freeland, her last owner, thought she was unhappy because she was denied the privilege of going home of nights to her husband, instead of being on hand at the beck and call of her master and mistress day and night. So the very day Julia and her husband escaped, arrangements had been made to put her up at auction a third time. But both Julia and her husband had seen enough of Slavery to leave no room to hope that they could ever find peace or rest so long as they remained. So there and then, they resolved to strike for Canada, via the Underground Rail Road. By a little good management, berths were procured for them on one of the Richmond steamers (berths not known to the officers of the boat), and they were safely landed in the hands of the Vigilance Committee, and a most agreeable interview was had.</p><p>The Committee extended to them the usual hospitalities, in the way of board, accommodations, and free tickets Canadaward, and wished them a safe and speedy passage. The passengers departed, exceedingly light-hearted, Feb. 1, 1854.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Fearing that it would be put into execution, James thought he had better let no time be lost in getting on towards Canada, though he was entitled to his Freedom at the age of twenty-five. Left his father, four brothers and two sisters.

He was not free, however, from the sad thought of having left his wife and three children in the &quot;<em>prison house</em>,&quot; nor of the fact that his own dear mother was brutally stabbed to the heart with a butcher knife by her young master, while he (Perry) was a babe; nor of a more recent tragedy by which a fellow-servant, only a short while before he fled, was also murdered by a stab in the groin from another young master. &quot;Powerful bad&quot; treatment, and &quot;no pay,&quot; was the only reward poor Perry had ever received for his life services. Perry could only remember his having received from his master, in all, eleven cents. Left a brother and sister in Slavery. Perry was worth $1200 perhaps.</p><p>Perry was compelled to leave his wife and three children--namely, Hannah (wife), Perry Henry, William Thomas and Alexander, who were owned by John McGuire, of Caroline county, Maryland. Perry was a fellow-servant of James Massey, and was held by the same owner who held James. It is but just, to say, that it was not in the Pittman family that his mother and his fellow-servant had been so barbarously murdered. These occurrences took place before they came into the hands of Pittman.</p><p>The provocation for which his fellow-servant was killed, was said to be very trifling. In a moment of rage, his young master, John Piper, plunged the blade of a small knife into Perry&#39;s groin, which resulted in his death twenty-six hours afterwards. For one day only the young master kept himself concealed, then he came forward and said he &quot;did it in self-defense,&quot; and there the matter ended. The half will never be told of the barbarism of Slavery.</p><p>Perry&#39;s letter subjoined, explains where he went, and how his mind was occupied with thoughts of his wife, children and friends.</p><pre><code>ST.

</code></pre><p>George Rhoads is a young man of twenty-five years of age, chestnut color, face round, and hating Slavery heartily. He had come from under the control of John P. Dellum a farmer, and a crabbed master, who &quot;would swear very much when crossed, and would drink moderately every day,&quot; except sometimes he would &quot;take a <em>spree</em>,&quot; and would then get pretty high. Withal he was a member of the Presbyterian church at Perryville, Maryland; he was a single man and followed farming. Within the last two or three years, he had sold a man and woman; hence, George thought it was time to take warning. Accordingly he felt it to be his duty to try for Canada, via Underground Rail Road. As his master had always declared that if one run off, he would sell the rest to Georgia, George very wisely concluded that as an effort would have to be made, they had better leave their master with as &quot;few as possible to be troubled with selling.&quot; Consequently, a consultation was had between the brothers, which resulted in the exit of a party of eight. The market price for George would be about $1400. A horrid example professed Christians set before the world, while holding slaves and upholding Slavery.</p><p>James Rhoads, brother of George, was twenty-three years of age, medium size, dark color, intelligent and manly, and would doubtless have brought, in the Richmond market, $1700. Fortunately he brought his wife and child with him. James was also held by the same task-master who held George. Often had he been visited with severe stripes, and had borne his full share of suffering from his master.</p><p>George Washington, one of the same party, was only about fifteen years of age; he was tall enough, however, to pass for a young man of twenty. George was of an excellent, fast, dark color. Of course, mentally he was undeveloped, nevertheless, possessed of enough mother-wit to make good his escape. In the slave market he might have been valued at $800. George was claimed as the lawful property of Benjamin Sylves--a Presbyterian, who owned besides, two men, three girls, and a boy. He was &quot;tolerable good&quot; sometimes, and sometimes &quot;bad.&quot; Some of the slaves supposed themselves to be on the eve of being emancipated about the time George left; but of this there was no certainty. George, however, was not among this hopeful number, consequently, he thought that he would start in time, and would be ready to shout for Freedom quite as soon as any other of his fellow-bondmen. George left a father and three sisters. Sarah Elizabeth Rhoads, wife of James Rhoads, was seventeen years of age, a tall, dark, young woman, who had had no chances for mental improvement, except such as were usual on a farm, stocked with slaves, where learning to read the Bible was against the &quot;rules.&quot; Sarah was a young slave mother with a babe (of course a slave) only eight months old. She was regarded as having been exceedingly fortunate in having rescued herself and child from the horrid fate of slaves.</p><p>MARY ELIZABETH STEPHENSON is a promising-looking young woman, of twenty years of age, chestnut color, and well made. Hard treatment had been her lot. Left her mother, two sisters and four brothers in bondage. Worth $1100.</p><p>Although these travelers were of the &quot;field hand&quot; class, who had never been permitted to see much off of the farm, and had been deprived of hearing intelligent people talk, yet the spirit of Freedom, so natural to man, was quite uppermost with all of them. The members of the Committee who saw them, were abundantly satisfied that these candidates for Canada would prove that they were able to &quot;take care of themselves.&quot;</p><p>Their wants were attended to in the usual manner, and they were sent on their way rejoicing, the Committee feeling quite a deep interest in them. It looked like business to see so many passing over the Road.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>CHARLES THOMPSON,</p><p>CARRIER OF &quot;THE NATIONAL AMERICAN,&quot; OFF FOR CANADA.</p><p>The subjoined &quot;pass&quot; was brought to the Underground Rail Road station in Philadelphia by Charles, and while it was interesting as throwing light upon his escape, it is important also as a specimen of the way the &quot;pass&quot; system was carried on in the dark days of Slavery in Virginia:</p><pre><code>&quot;NAT. AMERICAN OFFICE,

Richmond, July 20th, 1857.

Permit Charles to pass and repass from this office to the
residence of Rev B. Manly&#39;s on Clay St., near 11th, at any hour
of the night for one month.

</code></pre><p>It is a very short document, but it used to be very unsafe for a slave in Richmond, or any other Southern city, to be found out in the evening without a legal paper of this description. The penalties for being found unprepared to face the police were fines, imprisonment and floggings. The satisfaction it seemed always to afford these guardians of the city to find either males or females trespassing in this particular, was unmistakable. It gave them (the police) the opportunity to prove to those they served (slaveholders), that they were the right men in the right place, guarding their interests. Then again they got the fine for pocket money, and likewise the still greater pleasure of administering the flogging. Who would want an office, if no opportunity should turn up whereby proof could be adduced of adequate qualifications to meet emergencies? But Charles was too wide awake to be caught without his pass day or night. Consequently he hung on to it, even after starting on his voyage to Canada. He, however, willingly surrendered it to a member of the Committee at his special request.</p><p>But in every way Charles was quite a remarkable man. It afforded the Committee great pleasure to make his acquaintance, and much practical and useful information was gathered from his story, which was felt to be truthful.</p><p>The Committee feeling assured that this &quot;chattel&quot; must have been the subject of much inquiry and anxiety from the nature of his former position, as a prominent piece of property, as a member of the Baptist church, as taking &quot;first premiums&quot; in making tobacco, and as a paper carrier in the National American office, felt called upon to note fully his movements before and after leaving Richmond.</p><p>In stature he was medium size, color quite dark, hair long and bushy--rather of a raw-boned and rugged appearance, modest and self-possessed; with much more intelligence than would be supposed from first observation. On his arrival, ere he had &quot;shaken hands with the (British) Lion&#39;s paw,&quot; (which he was desirous of doing), or changed the habiliments in which he escaped, having listened to the recital of his thrilling tale, and wishing to get it word for word as it flowed naturally from his brave lips, at a late hour of the night a member of the Committee remarked to him, with pencil in hand, that he wanted to take down some account of his life. &quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;we shall have to be brief. Please answer as correctly as you can the following questions:&quot; &quot;How old are you?&quot; &quot;Thirty-two years old the 1st day of last June.&quot; &quot;Were you born a slave?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;How have you been treated?&quot; &quot;Badly all the time for the last twelve years.&quot; &quot;What do you mean by being treated badly?&quot; &quot;Have been whipped, and they never give me anything; some people give their servants at Christmas a dollar and a half and two dollars, and some five, but my master would never give me anything.&quot; &quot;What was the name of your master?&quot; &quot;Fleming Bibbs.&quot; &quot;Where did he live?&quot; &quot;In Caroline county, fifty miles above Richmond.&quot; &quot;What did he do?&quot; &quot;He was a farmer.&quot; &quot;Did you ever live with him?&quot; &quot;Never did; always hired me out, and then I couldn&#39;t please him.&quot; &quot;What kind of a man was he?&quot; &quot;A man with a very severe temper; would drink at all times, though would do it slyly.&quot; &quot;Was he a member of any church?&quot; &quot;Baptist church--would curse at his servants as if he wern&#39;t in any church.&quot; &quot;Were his family members of church, too?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;What kind of family had he?&quot; &quot;His wife was a tolerable fair woman, but his sons were dissipated, all of them <em>rowdies</em> and <em>gamblers. His sons has had children by the servants. One of his daughters had a child by his grandson last April</em>. They are traders, buy and sell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How many slaves did he own?&quot; &quot;Sam, Richmond, Henry, Dennis, Jesse, Addison, Hilliard, Jenny, Lucius, Julia, Charlotte, Easte, Joe, Taylor, Louisa, two more small children and Jim.&quot; Did any of them know that you were going to leave? &quot;No, I saw my brother Tuesday, but never told him a word about it.&quot; &quot;What put it into your head to leave?&quot; &quot;It was bad treatment; for being put in jail for sale the 7th of last January; was whipped in jail and after I came out the only thing they told me was that I had been selling newspapers about the streets, and was half free.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where did you live then?&quot; &quot;In Richmond, Va.; for twenty-two years I have been living out.&quot; &quot;How much did your master receive a year for your hire?&quot; &quot;From sixty-five to one hundred and fifty dollars.&quot; &quot;Did you have to find yourself?&quot; &quot;The people who hired me found me. The general rule is in Richmond, for a week&#39;s board, seventy-five cents is allowed; if he gets any more than that he has got to find it himself.&quot; &quot;How about Sunday clothing?&quot; &quot;Find them yourself?&quot; &quot;How about a house to live in?&quot; &quot;Have that to find yourself.&quot; &quot;Suppose you have a wife and family.&quot; &quot;It makes no difference, they don&#39;t allow you anything for that at all.&quot; &quot;Suppose you are sick who pays your doctor&#39;s bill?&quot; &quot;He (master) pays that.&quot; &quot;How do you manage to make a little extra money?&quot; &quot;By getting up before day and carrying out papers and doing other jobs, cleaning up single men&#39;s rooms and the like of that.&quot; &quot;What have you been employed at in Richmond?&quot; &quot;Been working in tobacco factory in general; this year I was hired at a printing-office. The National American. I carried papers.&quot; &quot;Had you a wife?&quot; &quot;I did, but her master was a very bad man and was opposed to me, and was against my coming to his place to see my wife, and he persuaded her to take another husband in preference to me; being in his hands she took his advice.&quot; &quot;How long ago was that?&quot; &quot;Very near twelve months; she got married last fall.&quot; &quot;Had you any children?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;How many?&quot; &quot;Five.&quot; &quot;Where are they?&quot; &quot;Three are with Joel Luck, her master, one with his sister Eliza, and the other belongs to Judge Hudgins, of Bowling Green Court House.&quot; &quot;Do you ever expect to see them again?&quot; &quot;No, not till the day of the Great I am!&quot; &quot;Did you ever have any chance of schooling?&quot; &quot;Not a day in my life.&quot; &quot;Can you read?&quot; &quot;No, sir, nor write my own name.&quot; &quot;What do you think of Slavery any how?&quot; &quot;I think it&#39;s a great curse, and I think the <em>Baptists</em> in <em>Richmond</em> will go to the deepest hell, if there is any, for they are so wicked they will work you all day and part of the night, and <em>wear cloaks and long faces</em>, and try to get all the work out of you they can by telling you about Jesus Christ. All the extra money you make they think you will give to hear talk about Jesus Christ. Out of their extra money they have to pay a white man <em>Five hundred dollars a year for preaching</em>.&quot; &quot;What kind of preaching does he give them?&quot; &quot;He tells them if they die in their sins they will go to hell; don&#39;t tell them any thing about their elevation; he would tell them obey their masters and mistresses, for good servants make good masters.&quot; &quot;Did you belong to the Baptist Church?&quot; &quot;Yes, Second Baptist Church.&quot; &quot;Did you feel that the preaching you heard was the true Gospel?&quot; &quot;One part of it, and one part burnt me as bad as ever insult did. They would tell us that we must take money out of our pockets to send it to Africa, to enlighten the African race. I think that we were about as blind in Richmond as the African race is in Africa. All they want you to know, is to have sense enough to say master and mistress, and <em>run</em> like lightning, when they speak to you, to do exactly what they want you to do,&quot; &quot;When you made up your mind to escape, where did you think you would go to?&quot; &quot;I made up my mind not to stop short of the British protection; to shake hands with the <em>Lion&#39;s</em> paw.&quot; &quot;Were you not afraid of being captured on the way, of being devoured by the abolitionists, or of freezing and starving in Canada?&quot; &quot;Well, I had often thought that I would be in a bad condition to come here, without money and clothes, but I made up my mind to come, live or die.&quot; &quot;What are your impressions from what little you have seen of Freedom?&quot; &quot;I think it is intended for all men, and all men ought to have it.&quot; &quot;Suppose your master was to appear before you, and offer you the privilege of returning to Slavery or death on the spot, which would be your choice?&quot; &quot;<em>Die right there</em>. I made up my mind before I started.&quot; &quot;Do you think that many of the slaves are anxious about their Freedom?&quot; &quot;The third part of them ain&#39;t anxious about it, because the white people have <em>blinded</em> them, telling about the North,--they <em>can&#39;t live here</em>; telling them that the people are worse off than they are there; they say that the &#39;niggers&#39; in the North have no houses to live in, stand about freezing, dirty, no clothes to wear. They all would be very glad to get their time, but want to stay where they are.&quot; Just at this point of the interview, the hour of midnight admonished us that it was time to retire. Accordingly, said Mr. Thompson, &quot;I guess we had better close,&quot; adding, if he &quot;could only write, he could give seven volumes!&quot; Also, said he, &quot;give my best respects to Mr. W.W. Hardwicke, and Mr. Perry in the National American office, and tell them <em>I wish they will pay the two boys who carry the papers for me, for they are as ignorant of this matter as you are</em>.&quot;</p><p>Charles was duly forwarded to Canada to shake hands with the Lion&#39;s paw, and from the accounts which came from him to the Committee, he was highly delighted. The following letter from him afforded gratifying evidence, that he neither forgot his God nor his friends in freedom:</p><pre><code>DETROIT, Sept. 17, 1862.

</code></pre><p>BLOOD FLOWED FREELY.</p><p>ABRAM GALLOWAY AND RICHARD EDEN, TWO PASSENGERS SECRETED IN A VESSEL LOADED WITH SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE. SHROUDS PREPARED TO PREVENT BEING SMOKED TO DEATH.</p><p>The Philadelphia branch of the Underground Rail Road was not fortunate in having very frequent arrivals from North Carolina. Of course such of her slave population as managed to become initiated in the mysteries of traveling North by the Underground Rail Road were sensible enough to find out nearer and safer routes than through Pennsylvania. Nevertheless the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia occasionally had the pleasure of receiving some heroes who were worthy to be classed among the bravest of the brave, no matter who they may be who have claims to this distinction.</p><p>In proof of this bold assertion the two individuals whose names stand at the beginning of this chapter are presented. Abram was only twenty-one years of age, mulatto, five feet six inches high, intelligent and the picture of good health. &quot;What was your master&#39;s name?&quot; inquired a member of the Committee. &quot;Milton Hawkins,&quot; answered Abram. &quot;What business did Milton Hawkins follow?&quot; again queried said member. &quot;He was chief engineer on the Wilmington and Manchester Rail Road&quot; (not a branch of the Underground Rail Road), responded Richard. &quot;Describe him,&quot; said the member. &quot;He was a slim built, tall man with whiskers. He was a man of very good disposition. I always belonged to him; he owned three. He always said he would sell before he would use a whip. His wife was a very mean woman; she would whip contrary to his orders.&quot; &quot;Who was your father?&quot; was further inquired. &quot;John Wesley Galloway,&quot; was the prompt response. &quot;Describe your father?&quot; &quot;He was captain of a government vessel; he recognized me as his son, and protected me as far as he was allowed so to do; he lived at Smithfield, North Carolina. Abram&#39;s master, Milton Hawkins, lived at Wilmington, N.C.&quot; &quot;What prompted you to escape?&quot; was next asked. &quot;Because times were hard and I could not come up with my wages as I was required to do, so I thought I would try and do better.&quot; At this juncture Abram explained substantially in what sense times were hard, &amp;c. In the first place he was not allowed to own himself; he, however, preferred hiring his time to serving in the usual way. This favor was granted Abram; but he was compelled to pay $15 per month for his time, besides finding himself in clothing, food, paying doctor bills, and a head tax of $15 a year.</p><p>[Illustration: HON. ABRAM GALLOWAY]</p><p>Even under this master, who was a man of very good disposition, Abram was not contented. In the second place, he &quot;always thought Slavery was wrong,&quot; although he had &quot;never suffered any personal abuse.&quot; Toiling month after month the year round to support his master and not himself, was the one intolerable thought. Abram and Richard were intimate friends, and lived near each other. Being similarly situated, they could venture to communicate the secret feelings of their hearts to each other. Richard was four years older than Abram, with not quite so much Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins, but was equally as intelligent, and was by trade, a &quot;fashionable barber,&quot; well-known to the ladies and gentlemen of Wilmington. Richard owed service to Mrs. Mary Loren, a widow. &quot;She was very kind and tender to all her slaves.&quot; &quot;If I was sick,&quot; said Richard, &quot;she would treat me the same as a mother would.&quot; She was the owner of twenty, men, women and children, who were all hired out, except the children too young for hire. Besides having his food, clothing and doctor&#39;s expenses to meet, he had to pay the &quot;very kind and tender-hearted widow&quot; $12.50 per month, and head tax to the State, amounting to twenty-five cents per month. It so happened, that Richard at this time, was involved in a matrimonial difficulty. Contrary to the laws of North Carolina, he had lately married a free girl, which was an indictable offence, and for which the penalty was then in soak for him--said penalty to consist of thirty-nine lashes, and imprisonment at the discretion of the judge.</p><p>So Abram and Richard put their heads together, and resolved to try the Underground Rail Road. They concluded that liberty was worth dying for, and that it was their duty to strike for Freedom even if it should cost them their lives. The next thing needed, was information about the Underground Rail Road. Before a great while the captain of a schooner turned up, from Wilmington, Delaware. Learning that his voyage extended to Philadelphia, they sought to find out whether this captain was true to Freedom. To ascertain this fact required no little address. It had to be done in such a way, that even the captain would not really understand what they were up to, should he be found untrue. In this instance, however, he was the right man in the right place, and very well understood his business.</p><p>Abram and Richard made arrangements with him to bring them away; they learned when the vessel would start, and that she was loaded with tar, rosin, and spirits of turpentine, amongst which the captain was to secrete them. But here came the difficulty. In order that slaves might not be secreted in vessels, the slave-holders of North Carolina had procured the enactment of a law requiring all vessels coming North to be smoked.</p><p>To escape this dilemma, the inventive genius of Abram and Richard soon devised a safe-guard against the smoke. This safe-guard consisted in silk oil cloth shrouds, made large, with drawing strings, which, when pulled over their heads, might be drawn very tightly around their waists, whilst the process of smoking might be in operation. A bladder of water and towels were provided, the latter to be wet and held to their nostrils, should there be need. In this manner they had determined to struggle against death for liberty. The hour approached for being at the wharf. At the appointed time they were on hand ready to go on the boat; the captain secreted them, according to agreement. They were ready to run the risk of being smoked to death; but as good luck would have it, the law was not carried into effect in this instance, so that the &quot;smell of smoke was not upon them.&quot; The effect of the turpentine, however, of the nature of which they were totally ignorant, was worse, if possible, than the smoke would have been. The blood was literally drawn from them at every pore in frightful quantities. But as heroes of the bravest type they resolved to continue steadfast as long as a pulse continued to beat, and thus they finally conquered.</p><p>The invigorating northern air and the kind treatment of the Vigilance Committee acted like a charm upon them, and they improved very rapidly from their exhaustive and heavy loss of blood. Desiring to retain some memorial of them, a member of the Committee begged one of their silk shrouds, and likewise procured an artist to take the photograph of one of them; which keepsakes have been valued very highly. In the regular order of arrangements the wants of Abram and Richard were duly met by the Committee, financially and otherwise, and they were forwarded to Canada. After their safe arrival in Canada, Richard addressed a member of the Committee thus:</p><pre><code>KINGSTON, July 20, 1857.

He had, however, managed to steal the art of reading and writing, to a certain extent. Notwithstanding the Patriarchal Institution of the South, he was to all intents and purposes a rebel at heart, consequently he resolved to take a trip on the Underground Rail Road to Canada. So, greatly to the surprise of those whom he was serving, he was one morning inquired for in vain. No one could tell what had become of Jack no more than if he had vanished like a ghost. Doubtless Messrs. McHenry and McCulloch were under the impression that newspapers and money possessed great power and could, under the circumstances, be used with entire effect. The following advertisement is evidence, that Jack was much needed at the tobacco factory.</p><pre><code>$100 REWARD--For the apprehension and delivery to us of a

He was aware, too, that he was the reputed son of a white gentleman, who was a professional dentist, by the name of Dr. Peter Cards. The Doctor, however, had been called away by death, so Jack could see no hope or virtue in having a white father, although a &quot;chivalric gentleman,&quot; while living, and a man of high standing amongst slave-holders. Jack was a member of the Baptist church, too, and hoped he was a good Christian; but he could look for no favors from the Church, or sympathy on the score of his being a Christian. He knew very well were it known, that he had the love of freedom in his heart, or the idea of the Underground Rail Road in his head, he would be regarded as having committed the &quot;unpardonable sin.&quot; So Jack looked to none of these &quot;broken reeds&quot; in Richmond in the hour of his trial, but to Him above, whom he had not seen, and to the Underground Rail Road. He felt pretty well satisfied, that if Providence would aid him, and he could get a conductor to put him on the right road to Canada, he would be all right. Accordingly, he acted up to his best light, and thus he succeeded admirably, as the sequel shows.</p><p>JOHN HENRY PETTIFOOT. John is a likely young man, quite bright in color and in intellect also. He was the son of Peter Cards, a dentist by profession, and a white man by complexion. As a general thing, he had been used &#39;very well;&#39; had no fault to find, except this year, being hired to McHenry &amp; McCulloch, tobacconists, of Petersburg, Va., whom he found rather more oppressive than he agreed for, and supposing that he had &#39;no right&#39; to work for any body for nothing, he &#39;picked up his bed and walked.&#39; His mistress had told him that he was &#39;<em>willed</em> free,&#39; at her death, but John was not willing to wait her &quot;motions to die.&quot;</p><p>He had a wife in Richmond, but was not allowed to visit her. He left one sister and a step-father in bondage. Mr. Pettifoot reached Philadelphia by the Richmond line of steamers, stowed away among the pots and cooking utensils. On reaching the city, he at once surrendered himself into the hands of the Committee, and was duly looked after by the regular acting members.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

He had the good fortune to escape from Edward H. Hubbert, a ship timber merchant of Norfolk, Va. Under Hubbert&#39;s yoke he had served only five years, having been bought by him from a certain Aldridge Mandrey, who was described as a &quot;very cruel man,&quot; and would &quot;rather fight than eat.&quot; &quot;I have licks that will carry me to my grave, and will be there till the flesh rots off my bones,&quot; said Emanuel, adding that his master was a &quot;<em>devil</em>,&quot; though a member of the Reformed Methodist Church. But his mistress, he said, was a &quot;right nice little woman, and kept many licks off me.&quot; &quot;If you said you were sick, he would whip it out of you.&quot; From Mandrey he once fled, and was gone two months, but was captured at Williamsburg, Va., and received a severe flogging, and carried home. Hubbert finally sold Emanuel to a Mr. Grigway of Norfolk; with Emanuel Mr. G. was pretty well suited, but his wife was not--he had &quot;too much white blood in him&quot; for her. Grigway and his wife were members of the Episcopal Church.</p><p>In this unhappy condition Emanuel found a conductor of the Underground Rail Road. A secret passage was secured for him on one of the Richmond steamers, and thus he escaped from his servitude. The Committee attended to his wants, and forwarded him on as usual. From Syracuse, where he was breathing quite freely under the protection of the Rev. J.W. Loguen, he wrote the following letter:</p><pre><code>SYRACUSE, July 29, 1857.

Fortunately, however, letters from the good friends, who plucked this infant from the jaws of Slavery, have been preserved to throw light on this little one, and to show how true-hearted sympathizers with the Slave labored amid dangers and difficulties to save the helpless bondman from oppression. It will be observed, that both these friends wrote from Washington, D.C., the seat of Government, where, if Slavery was not seen in its worst aspects, the Government in its support of Slavery appeared in a most revolting light.</p><p>LETTER FROM &quot;J.B.&quot;</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., July 12, 1857.

The cause was safe in such careful hands. The following letters, bearing on the same case, are also from another good conductor, who was then living in Washington.</p><p>LETTERS FROM E.L. STEVENS.</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., July 8,1857.

MY DEAR SIR:--I write you now to let you know that the children
of E. are yet well, and that Mrs. Arrah Weems will start with
one of them for Philadelphia to-morrow or next day. She will be
with you probably in the day train. She goes for the purpose of
making an effort to redeem her last child, now in Slavery. The
whole amount necessary is raised, except about $300. She will
take her credentials with her, and you can place the most
implicit reliance on her statements. The story in regard to the
Weems&#39; family was published in Frederick Douglass&#39; paper two
years ago. Since then the two middle boys have been redeemed and
there is only one left in Slavery, and he is in Alabama. The
master has agreed to take for him just what he gave, $1100. Mr.
Lewis Tappan has his letter and the money, except the amount
specified. There were about $5000 raised in England to redeem
this family, and they are now all free except this one. And
there never was a more excellent and worthy family than the
Weems&#39; family. I do hope, that Mrs. W. will find friends who can
advance the amount required.

Truly Yours,

E.L. STEVENS.





WASHINGTON, D.C., July 13th, 1857.

MY FRIEND:--Your kind letter in reply to mine about Arrah was
duly received. As she is doubtless with you before this, she
will explain all. I propose that a second journey be made by her
or some one else, in order to take the other. They have been a
great burden to the good folks here and should have been _at
home_ long ere this. Arrah will explain everything. I want,
however, to say a word in her behalf. If there is a person in
the world, that deserves the hearty co-operation of every friend
of humanity, that person is Arrah Weems, who now, after a long
series of self-sacrificing labor to aid others in their struggle
for their God-given rights, solicits a small amount to redeem
the last one of her own children in Slavery. Never have I had my
sympathies so aroused in behalf of any object as in behalf of
this most worthy family. She can tell you what I have done. And
I do hope, that our friends in Philadelphia and New York will
assist her to make up the full amount required for the purchase
of the boy.

After she does what she can in P., will you give her the proper
direction about getting to New York and to Mr. Tappan&#39;s? Inform
him of what she has done, &amp;c.

Please write me as soon as you can as to whether she arrived
safely, &amp;c. Give me your opinion, also, as to the proposal about
the other. Had you not better keep the little one in P. till the
other is taken there? Inform me also where E. is, how she is
getting along, &amp;c., who living with, &amp;c.

Yours Truly,

E.L.S.
</code></pre><p>In this instance, also, as in the case of &quot;J.B.,&quot; the care and anxiety of other souls, besides this child, crying for deliverance, weighed heavily on the mind of Mr. Stevens, as may be inferred from certain references in his letters. Mr. Stevens&#39; love of humanity, and impartial freedom, even in those dark days of Slavery, when it was both unpopular and unsafe to allow the cries of the bondman to awaken the feeling of humanity to assist the suffering, was constantly leading him to take sides with the oppressed, and as he appears in this correspondence, so it was his wont daily to aid the helpless, who were all around him. Arrah Weems, who had the care of the child, alluded to so touchingly by Mr. Stevens, had known, to her heart&#39;s sorrow, how intensely painful it was to a mother&#39;s feelings to have her children torn from her by a cruel master and sold. For Arrah had had a number of children sold, and was at that very time striving diligently to raise money to redeem the last one of them. And through such kind-hearted friends as Mr. Stevens, the peculiar hardships of this interesting family of Weems&#39; were brought to the knowledge of thousands of philanthropists in this country and England, and liberal contributions had already been made by friends of the Slave on both sides of the ocean. It may now be seen, that while this child had not been a conscious sufferer from the wicked system of Slavery, it had been the object of very great anxiety and suffering to several persons, who had individually perilled their own freedom for its redemption. This child, however, was safely brought to the Vigilance Committee, in Philadelphia, and was duly forwarded, <em>via</em> friends in New York, to its mother, in Syracuse, where she had stopped to work and wait for her little one, left behind at the time she escaped.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Under changed names, in many instances, it has been found to be no easy matter to cull from a great variety of letters, records and advertisements, just when wanted, all the particulars essential to complete many of these narratives. The case of the child, alluded to above, is a case in point. Thus, however, while it is impossible to introduce the mother&#39;s story in its proper place, yet, since it has been found, it is too important and interesting to be left out. It is here given as follows:</p><pre><code>$300 REWARD.--RAN AWAY from the subscriber on Saturday, the 30th

Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.
</code></pre><p>Emeline Chapman, so particularly described in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; of the 23d of September, 1856, arrived by the regular Underground Rail Road train from Washington. In order to escape the responsibility attached to her original name, she adopted the name of Susan Bell. Thus for freedom she was willing to forego her name, her husband, and even her little children. It was a serious sacrifice; but she had been threatened with the auction block, and she well understood what that meant. With regard to usage, having lived away from her owner, Emeline did not complain of any very hard times. True, she had been kept at work very constantly, and her owner had very faithfully received all her hire. Emeline had not even been allowed enough of her hire to find herself in clothing, or anything for the support of her two children--for these non-essentials, her kind mistress allowed her to seek elsewhere, as best she could. Emeline&#39;s husband was named John Henry; her little girl she called Margaret Ann, and her babe she had named after its father, all with the brand of Slavery upon them. The love of freedom, in the breast of this spirited young Slave-wife and mother, did not extinguish the love she bore to her husband and children, however otherwise her course, in leaving them, as she did, might appear. For it was just this kind of heroic and self-sacrificing struggle, that appealed to the hearts of men and compelled attention. The letters of Biglow and Stevens, relative to the little child, prove this fact, and additional testimony found in the appended letter from Rev. J.W. Loguen conclusively confirms the same. Indeed, who could close his eyes and ears to the plaintive cries of such a mother? Who could refrain from aiding on to freedom children honored in such a heroic parent?</p><pre><code>SYRACUSE, Oct. 5, 1856.

DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I write to you for Mrs. Susan Bell, who was
at your city some time in September last. She is from Washington
city. She left her dear little children behind (two children).
She is stopping in our city, and wants to hear from her children
very much indeed. She wishes to know if you have heard from Mr.
Biglow, of Washington city. She will remain here until she can
hear from you. She feels very anxious about her children, I will
assure you. I should have written before this, but I have been
from home much of the time since she came to our city. She wants
to know if Mr. Biglow has heard anything about her husband. If
you have not written to Mr. Biglow, she wishes you would. She
sends her love to you and your dear family. She says that you
were all kind to her, and she does not forget it. You will
direct your letter to me, dear brother, and I will see that she
gets it.

Miss F.E. Watkins left our house yesterday for Ithaca, and other
places in that part of the State. Frederick Douglass, Wm. J.
Watkins and others were with us last week; Gerritt Smith with
others. Miss Watkins is doing great good in our part of the
State. We think much indeed of her. She is such a good and
glorious speaker, that we are all charmed with her. We have had
thirty-one fugitives in the last twenty-seven days; but you, no
doubt, have had many more than that. I hope the good Lord may
bless you and spare you long to do good to the hunted and
outraged among our brethren.

JOHNSON.</p><p>ARRIVAL FROM THE &quot;DAILY DISPATCH&quot; OFFICE.</p><p>&quot;Sam&quot; was doing Slave labor at the office of the Richmond &quot;Daily Dispatch,&quot; as a carrier of that thoroughly pro-slavery sheet. &quot;Sam&quot; had possessed himself somehow of a knowledge of reading and writing a little, and for the news of the day he had quite an itching ear. Also with regard to his freedom he was quite solicitous. Being of an ambitious turn of mind, he hired his time, for which he paid his master $175 per annum in regular quarterly payments. Besides paying this amount, he had to find himself in board, clothing, and pay doctor&#39;s expenses. He had had more than one owner in his life. The last one, however, he spoke of thus: &quot;His name is James B. Foster, of Richmond, a very hard man. He owns three more Slaves besides myself.&quot; In escaping, &quot;Sam&quot; was obliged to leave his wife, who was owned by Christian Bourdon. His attachment to her, judging from his frequent warm expressions of affection, was very strong. But, as strong as it was, he felt that he could not consent to remain in slavery any longer. &quot;Sam&quot; had luckily come across a copy of Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin, and in perusing it, all his notions with regard to &quot;Masters and Servants,&quot; soon underwent an entire change, and he began to cast his eyes around him to see how he might get his freedom. One who was thoroughly awake as he was to the idea of being free, with a fair share of courage, could now and then meet with the opportunity to escape by the steamers or schooners coming North. Thus Samuel found the way open and on one of the steamers came to Philadelphia. On arriving, he was put at once in the charge of the Committee. While in their hands he seemed filled with astonishment at his own achievements, and such spontaneous expressions as naturally flowed from his heart thrilled and amazed his new found friends, and abundant satisfaction was afforded, that Samuel Washington Johnson would do no discredit to his fugitive comrades in Canada. So the Committee gladly aided him on his journey.</p><p>After arriving in Canada, Samuel wrote frequently and intelligently. The subjoined letter to his wife shows how deeply he was attached to her, and, at the same time, what his views were of Slavery. The member of the Committee to whom it was sent with the request, that it should be forwarded to her, did not meet with the opportunity of doing so. A copy of it was preserved with other Underground Rail Road documents.</p><p>LETTER FROM SAMUEL W. JOHNSON TO HIS WIFE.</p><pre><code>My Dear Wife I now embrace this golden opportunity of writing a

But of all the trials which Slaves had to endure, the separations of husbands and wives were the most difficult to bear up under.

</code></pre><p>FAMILY FROM BALTIMORE.</p><p>STEPHEN AMOS, <em>alias</em> HENRY JOHNSON, HARRIET, <em>alias</em> MARY JANE JOHNSON (man and wife), and their four children, ANN REBECCA, WM. H., ELIZABETH and MARY ELLEN. Doubtless, in the eyes of a Slaveholder, a more &quot;likely-looking&quot; family could not readily be found in Baltimore, than the one to be now briefly noticed. The mother and her children were owned by a young slave-holder, who went by the name of William Giddings, and resided in Prince George&#39;s county, Md. Harriet acknowledged, that she had been treated &quot;tolerably well in earlier days&quot; for one in her condition; but, as in so many instances in the experience of Slaves, latterly, times had changed with her and she was compelled to serve under a new master who oft-times treated her &quot;very severely.&quot; On one occasion, seven years previously, a brother of her owner for a trifling offence struck and kicked her so brutally, that she was immediately thrown into a fit of sickness, which lasted &quot;all one summer&quot;--from this she finally recovered.</p><p>On another occasion, about one year previous to her escape, she was seized by her owner and thrust into prison to be sold. In this instance the interference of the Uncle of Harriet&#39;s master saved her from the auction block. The young master, was under age, and at the same time under the guardianship of his Uncle. The young master had early acquired an ardent taste for fast horses, gambling, etc. Harriet felt, that her chances for the future in the hands of such a brutal master could not be other than miserable. Her husband had formerly been owned by John S. Giddings, who was said to have been a &quot;mild man.&quot; He had allowed Stephen (her husband) to buy himself, and for eighteen months prior to the flight, he had been what was called a free man. It should also be further stated in justice to Stephen&#39;s master, that he was so disgusted with the manner in which Stephen&#39;s wife was treated, that he went so far as to counsel Stephen to escape with his wife and children. Here at least is one instance where a Maryland slave-holder lends his influence to the Underground Rail Road cause. The counsel was accepted, and the family started on their perilous flight. And although they necessarily had manifest trials and difficulties to discourage and beset them, they battled bravely with all these odds and reached the Vigilance Committee safely. Harriet was a bright mulatto, with marked features of character, and well made, with good address and quite intelligent. She was about twenty-six years of age. The children also were remarkably fine-looking little creatures, but too young to know the horrors of Slavery. The Committee at once relieved them of their heavy load of anxiety by cheering words and administering to their necessities with regard to food, money, etc. After the family had somewhat recovered from the fatigue and travel-worn condition in which they arrived, and were prepared to resume their journey, the Committee gave them the strictest caution with regard to avoiding slave-hunters, and also in reference to such points on the road where they would be most in danger of going astray from a lack of knowledge of the way. Then, with indescribable feelings of sympathy, free tickets were tendered them, and they having been conducted to the depot, were sent on their way rejoicing.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Elijah spoke of him as a &quot;favorable man,&quot; but added, &quot;I&#39;d rather be free.

For refusing to be flogged, one time at Hall&#39;s Factory, the overseer, in a rage, &quot;took up a hickory club&quot; and laid his head &quot;open on each side.&quot; Overpowered and wounded, he was stripped naked and compelled to receive THREE HUNDRED LASHES, by which he was literally excoriated from head to foot. For six months afterwards he was &quot;laid up.&quot; Last year he was hired out for &quot;one hundred and eighty dollars,&quot; out of which he &quot;received but five dollars.&quot; This year he brought &quot;one hundred and ninety dollars.&quot; Up to the time he escaped, he had received &quot;two dollars,&quot; and the promise of &quot;more at Christmas.&quot; Left brothers and sisters, all ignorant of his way of escape. The following pass brought away by Elijah speaks for itself, and will doubtless be interesting to some of our readers who are ignorant of what used to be Republican usages in the &quot;land of the Free.&quot;</p><pre><code>RICHMOND, July 3d, 1857.

</code></pre><p>SOLOMON BROWN.</p><p>ARRIVED PER CITY OF RICHMOND.</p><p>This candidate for Canada managed to secure a private berth on the steamship City of Richmond. He was thus enabled to leave his old mistress, Mary A. Ely, in Norfolk, the place of her abode, and the field of his servitude. Solomon was only twenty-two years of age, rather under the medium size, dark color, and of much natural ability. He viewed Slavery as a great hardship, and for a length of time had been watching for an opportunity to free himself. He had been in the habit of hiring his time of his mistress, for which he paid ten dollars per month. This amount failed to satisfy the mistress, as she was inclined to sell him to North Carolina, where Slave stock, at that time, was commanding high prices. The idea of North Carolina and a new master made Solomon rather nervous, and he was thereby prompted to escape. On reaching the Committee he manifested very high appreciation of the attention paid him, and after duly resting for a day, he was sent on his way rejoicing. Seven days after leaving Philadelphia, he wrote back from Canada as follows:</p><pre><code>ST. CATHARINES, Feb. 20th, 1854.

MR. STILL--DEAR SIR:--It is with great pleasure that I have to
inform you, that I have arrived safe in a land of freedom.
Thanks to kind friends that helped me here. Thank God that I am
treading on free soil. I expect to go to work to-morrow in a
steam factory.

I would like to have you, if it is not too much trouble, see Mr.
Minhett, the steward on the boat that I came out on, when he
gets to Norfolk, to go to the place where my clothes are, and
bring them to you, and you direct them to the care of Rev. Hiram
Wilson, St. Catharines, Niagara District, Canada West, by
rail-road via Suspension Bridge. You mentioned if I saw Mr.
Foreman. I was to deliver a message--he is not here. I saw two
yesterday in church, from Norfolk, that I had known there. You
will send my name, James Henry, as you knew me by that name;
direct my things to James Henry. My love to your wife and
children.

Yours Respectfully,

In speaking of him, William gave him the character of being a &quot;fierce and rough man,&quot; who owned nine head of slaves. Two of William&#39;s sisters were held by Roberts, when he left. His excuse for running away was, &quot;ill-treatment.&quot; In traveling North, he walked to Columbia (in Pennsylvania), and there took the cars for Philadelphia. The Committee took charge of him, and having given him the usual aid, sent him hopefully on his way. After safely reaching Canada, the thought of his wife in a land of bondage, pressed so deeply upon his mind, that he was prompted to make an effort to rescue her. The following letter, written on his behalf by the Rev. H. Wilson, indicates his feelings and wishes with regard to her:</p><pre><code>ST. CATHARINES, Canada West, 24th July, 1854.

DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Your encouraging letter, to John
Smith, was duly received by him, and I am requested to write
again on his behalf. His colored friend in Baltimore county, who
would favor his designs, is Thomas Cook, whom he wishes you to
address, Baltimore post-office, care of Mr. Thomas Spicer.

He has received a letter from Thomas Cook, dated the 6th of
June, but it was a long time reaching him. He wishes you to say
to Cook, that he got his letter, and that he would like to have
him call on his wife and make known to her, that he is in good
health, doing well here, and would like to have her come on as
soon as she can.

As she is a free woman, there will, doubtless, be no difficulty
in her coming right through. He is working in the neighborhood
of St. Catharines, but twelve miles from Niagara Falls. You will
please recollect to address Thomas Cook, in the care of Thomas
Spicer, Baltimore Post-office. Smith&#39;s wife is at, or near the
place he came from, and, doubtless, Thomas Cook knows all about
her condition and circumstances. Please write again to John
Smith, in my care, if you please, and request Thomas Cook to do
the same.

Very respectfully yours in the cause of philanthropy.

</code></pre><p>TWO FEMALE PASSENGERS FEOM MARYLAND.</p><p>As the way of travel, <em>via</em> the Underground Rail Road, under the most favorable circumstances, even for the sterner sex, was hard enough to test the strongest nerves, and to try the faith of the bravest of the brave, every woman, who won her freedom, by this perilous undertaking, deserves commemoration. It is, therefore, a pleasure to thus transfer from the old Record book the names of Ann Johnson and Lavina Woolfley, who fled from Maryland in 1857. Their lives, however, had not been in any way very remarkable. Ann was tall, and of a dark chestnut color, with an intelligent countenance, and about twenty-four years of age. She had filled various situations as a Slave. Sometimes she was required to serve in the kitchen, at other times she was required to toil in the field, with the plow, hoe, and the like. Samuel Harrington, of Cambridge District, Maryland, was the name of the man for whose benefit Ann labored during her younger days. She had no hesitation in saying, that he was a very &quot;ill-natured man;&quot; he however, was a member of the &quot;old time Methodist Church.&quot; In Slave property he had invested only to the extent of some five or six head. About three years previous to Ann&#39;s escape, one of her brothers fled and went to Canada. This circumstance so enraged the owner, that he declared he would &quot;sell all&quot; he owned. Accordingly Ann was soon put on the auction block, and was bought by a man who went by the name of William Moore. Moore was a married man, who, with his wife, was addicted to intemperance and carousing. Ann found that she had simply got &quot;out of the fire into the frying-pan.&quot; She was really at a loss to tell when her lot was the harder, whether under the &quot;rum drinker,&quot; or the old time Methodist. In this state of mind she decided to leave all and go to Canada, the refuge for the fleeing bondman. Lavina, Ann&#39;s companion, was the wife of James Woolfley. She and her husband set out together, with six others, and were of the party of eight who were betrayed into Dover jail, as has already been described in these pages. After fighting their way out of the jail, they separated (for prudential reasons). The husband of Lavina, immediately after the conflict at the jail, passed on to Canada, leaving his wife under the protection of friends. Since that time several months had elapsed, but of each other nothing had been known, before she received information on her arrival at Philadelphia. The Committee was glad to inform her, that her husband had safely passed on to Canada, and that she would be aided on also, where they could enjoy freedom in a free country.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>CAPTAIN F. AND THE MAYOR OF NORFOLK.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE PASSENGERS SECRETED IN A BOAT. NOVEMBER, 1855.</p><p>CAPTAIN F. was certainly no ordinary man. Although he had been living a sea-faring life for many years, and the marks of this calling were plainly enough visible in his manners and speech, he was, nevertheless, unlike the great mass of this class of men, not addicted to intemperance and profanity. On the contrary, he was a man of thought, and possessed, in a large measure, those humane traits of character which lead men to sympathize with suffering humanity wherever met with.</p><p>It must be admitted, however, that the first impressions gathered from a hasty survey of his rough and rugged appearance, his large head, large mouth, large eyes, and heavy eye-brows, with a natural gift at keeping concealed the inner-workings of his mind and feelings, were not calculated to inspire the belief, that he was fitted to be entrusted with the lives of unprotected females, and helpless children; that he could take pleasure in risking his own life to rescue them from the hell of Slavery; that he could deliberately enter the enemy&#39;s domain, and with the faith of a martyr, face the dread slave-holder, with his Bowie-knives and revolvers--Slave-hunters, and blood-hounds, lynchings, and penitentiaries, for humanity&#39;s sake. But his deeds proved him to be a true friend of the Slave; whilst his skill, bravery, and success stamped him as one of the most daring and heroic Captains ever connected with the Underground Rail Road cause.</p><p>At the time he was doing most for humanity in rescuing bondsmen from Slavery, Slave-laws were actually being the most rigidly executed. To show mercy, in any sense, to man or woman, who might be caught assisting a poor Slave to flee from the prison-house, was a matter not to be thought of in Virginia. This was perfectly well understood by Captain F.; indeed he did not hesitate to say, that his hazardous operations might any day result in the &quot;sacrifice&quot; of his life. But on this point he seemed to give himself no more concern than he would have done to know which way the wind would blow the next day. He had his own convictions about dying and the future, and he declared, that he had &quot;no fear of death,&quot; however it might come. Still, he was not disposed to be reckless or needlessly to imperil his life, or the lives of those he undertook to aid. Nor was he averse to receiving compensation for his services. In Richmond, Norfolk, Petersburg, and other places where he traded, many slaves were fully awake to their condition. The great slave sales were the agencies that served to awaken a large number. Then the various mechanical trades were necessarily given to the Slaves, for the master had no taste for &quot;greasy, northern mechanics.&quot; Then, again, the stores had to be supplied with porters, draymen, etc., from the slave population. In the hearts of many of the more intelligent amongst the slaves, the men, as mechanics, etc., the women, as dress-makers, chamber-maids, etc., notwithstanding all the opposition and hard laws, the spirit of Freedom was steadily burning. Many of the slaves were half brothers, and sisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces to their owners, and of course &quot;blood would tell.&quot;</p><p>It was only necessary for the fact to be made known to a single reliable and intelligent slave, that a man with a boat running North had the love of Freedom for all mankind in his bosom to make that man an object of the greatest interest. If an angel had appeared amongst them doubtless his presence would not have inspired greater anxiety and hope than did the presence of Captain F. The class most anxious to obtain freedom could generally manage to acquire some means which they would willingly offer to captains or conductors in the South for such assistance as was indispensable to their escape. Many of the slaves learned if they could manage to cross Mason and Dixon&#39;s line, even though they might be utterly destitute and penniless, that they would then receive aid and protection from the Vigilance Committee. Here it may be well to state that, whilst the Committee gladly received and aided all who might come or be brought to them, they never employed agents or captains to go into the South with a view of enticing or running off slaves. So when captains operated, they did so with the full understanding that they alone were responsible for any failures attending their movements.</p><p>The way is now clear to present Captain F. with his schooner lying at the wharf in Norfolk, loading with wheat, and at the same time with twenty-one fugitives secreted therein. While the boat was thus lying at her mooring, the rumor was flying all over town that a number of slaves had escaped, which created a general excitement a degree less, perhaps, than if the citizens had been visited by an earthquake. The mayor of the city with a posse of officers with axes and long spears repaired to Captain F.&#39;s boat. The fearless commander received his Honor very coolly, and as gracefully as the circumstances would admit. The mayor gave him to understand who he was, and by what authority he appeared on the boat, and what he meant to do. &quot;Very well,&quot; replied Captain F., &quot;here I am and this is my boat, go ahead and search.&quot; His Honor with his deputies looked quickly around, and then an order went forth from the mayor to &quot;spear the wheat thoroughly.&quot; The deputies obeyed the command with alacrity. But the spears brought neither blood nor groans, and the sagacious mayor obviously concluded that he was &quot;barking up the wrong tree.&quot; But the mayor was not there for nothing. &quot;Take the axes and go to work,&quot; was the next order; and the axe was used with terrible effect by one of the deputies. The deck and other parts of the boat were chopped and split; no greater judgment being exercised when using the axe than when spearing the wheat; Captain F. all the while wearing an air of utter indifference or rather of entire composure. Indeed every step they took proved conclusively that they were wholly ignorant with regard to boat searching. At this point, with remarkable shrewdness, Captain F. saw wherein he could still further confuse them by a bold strategical move. As though about out of patience with the mayor&#39;s blunders, the captain instantly reminded his Honor that he had &quot;stood still long enough&quot; while his boat was being &quot;damaged, chopped up,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;Now if you want to search,&quot; continued he, &quot;give me the axe, and then point out the spot you want opened and I will open it for you very quick.&quot; While uttering these words he presented, as he was capable of doing, an indignant and defiant countenance, and intimated that it mattered not where or when a man died provided he was in the right, and as though he wished to give particularly strong emphasis to what he was saying, he raised the axe, and brought it down edge foremost on the deck with startling effect, at the same time causing the splinters to fly from the boards. The mayor and his posse seemed, if not dreadfully frightened, completely confounded, and by the time Captain F. had again brought down his axe with increased power, demanding where they would have him open, they looked as though it was time for them to retire, and in a few minutes after they actually gave up the search and left the boat without finding a soul. Daniel in the lions&#39; den was not safer than were the twenty-one passengers secreted on Captain F.&#39;s boat. The law had been carried out with a vengeance, but did not avail with this skilled captain. The &quot;five dollars&quot; were paid for being searched, the amount which was lawfully required of every captain sailing from Virginia. And the captain steered direct for the City of Brotherly Love. The wind of heaven favoring the good cause, he arrived safely in due time, and delivered his precious freight in the vicinity of Philadelphia within the reach of the Vigilance Committee. The names of the passengers were as follows:</p><p>[Illustration: Mayor and Police of Norfolk on Capt. Fountain&#39;s schooner.]</p><p>ALAN TATUM, DANIEL CARR, MICHAEL VAUGHN, THOMAS NIXON, FREDERICK NIXON, PETER PETTY, NATHANIEL GARDENER, JOHN BROWN, THOMAS FREEMAN, JAMES FOSTER, GODFREY SCOTT, WILLIS WILSON, NANCY LITTLE, JOHN SMITH, FRANCIS HAINES, DAVID JOHNSON, PHILLIS GAULT, ALICE JONES, NED WILSON, and SARAH C. WILSON, and one other, who subsequently passed on, having been detained on account of sickness. These passengers were most &quot;likely-looking articles;&quot; a number of them, doubtless, would have commanded the very highest prices in the Richmond market. Among them were some good mechanics--one excellent dress-maker, some &quot;prime&quot; waiters and chambermaids;--men and women with brains, some of them evincing remarkable intelligence and decided bravery, just the kind of passengers that gave the greatest satisfaction to the Vigilance Committee. The interview with these passengers was extremely interesting. Each one gave his or her experience of Slavery, the escape, etc., in his or her own way, deeply impressing those who had the privilege of seeing and hearing them, with the fact of the growing spirit of Liberty, and the wonderful perception and intelligence possessed by some of the sons of toil in the South. While all the names of these passengers were duly entered on the Underground Rail Road records, the number was too large, and the time they spent with the attempts to escape were made by Daniel, after being sold to North Carolina; for this offence, he was on one occasion stripped naked, and flogged severely. This did not cure him. Prior to his joining Captain F.&#39;s party, he had fled to the swamps, and dwelt there for three months, surrounded with wild animals and reptiles, and it was this state of solitude that he left directly before finding Captain F. Daniel had a wife in Portsmouth, to whom he succeeded in paying a private visit, when, to his unspeakable joy, he made the acquaintance of the noble Captain F., whose big heart was delighted to give him a passage North. Daniel, after being sold, had been allowed, within the two years, only one opportunity of visiting his wife; being thus debarred he resolved to escape. His wife, whose name was Hannah, had three children--slaves--their names were Sam, Dan, and &quot;baby.&quot; The name of the latter was unknown to him.</p><p>MICHAEL VAUGHN. Michael was about thirty-one years of age, with superior physical proportions, and no lack of common sense. His color was without paleness--dark and unfading, and his manly appearance was quite striking. Michael belonged to a lady, whom he described as a &quot;very disagreeable woman.&quot; &quot;For all my life I have belonged to her, but for the last eight years I have hired my time. I paid my mistress $120 a year; a part of the time I had to find my board and all my clothing.&quot; This was the direct, and unequivocal testimony that Michael gave of his slave life, which was the foundation for alleging that his mistress was a &quot;very disagreeable woman.&quot;</p><p>Michael left a wife and one child in Slavery; but they were not owned by his mistress. Before escaping, he felt afraid to lead his companion into the secret of his contemplated movements, as he felt, that there was no possible way for him to do anything for her deliverance; on the other hand, any revelation of the matter might prove too exciting for the poor soul;--her name was Esther. That he did not lose his affection for her whom he was obliged to leave so unceremoniously, is shown by the appended letter:</p><pre><code>NEW BEDFORD, August 22d, 1855.

DEAR SIR:--I send you this to inform you that I expect my wife
to come that way. If she should, you will direct her to me. When
I came through your city last Fall, you took my name in your
office, which was then given you, Michael Vaughn; since then my
name is William Brown, No. 130 Kempton street. Please give my
wife and child&#39;s name to Dr. Lundy, and tell him to attend to it
for me. Her name is Esther, and the child&#39;s name Louisa.

Truly yours,

WILLIAM BROWN.
</code></pre><p>Michael worked in a foundry. In church fellowship he was connected with the Methodists--his mistress with the Baptists.</p><p>THOMAS NIXON was about nineteen years of age, of a dark hue, and quite intelligent. He had not much excuse to make for leaving, except, that he was &quot;tired of staying&quot; with his &quot;owner,&quot; as he &quot;feared he might be sold some day,&quot; so he &quot;thought&quot; that he might as well save him the trouble. Thomas belonged to a Mr. Bockover, a wholesale grocer, No. 12 Brewer street. Thomas left behind him his mother and three brothers. His father was sold away when he was an infant, consequently he never saw him. Thomas was a member of the Methodist Church; his master was of the same persuasion.</p><p>FREDERICK NIXON was about thirty-three years of age, and belonged truly to the wide-awake class of slaves, as his marked physical and mental appearance indicated. He had a more urgent excuse for escaping than Thomas; he declared that he fled because, his owner wanted &quot;to work him hard without allowing him any chance, and had treated him rough.&quot; Frederick was also one of Mr. Bockover&#39;s chattels; he left his wife, Elizabeth, with four children in bondage. They were living in Eatontown, North Carolina. It had been almost one year since he had seen them. Had he remained in Norfolk he had not the slightest prospect of being reunited to his wife and children, as he had been already separated from them for about three years. This painful state of affairs only increased his desire to leave those who were brutal enough to make such havoc in his domestic relations.</p><p>PETER PETTY was about twenty-four years of age, and wore a happy countenance; he was a person of agreeable manners, and withal pretty smart. He acknowledged, that he had been owned by Joseph Boukley, Hair Inspector. Peter did not give Mr. Boukley a very good character, however; he said, that Mr. B. was &quot;rowdyish in his habits, was deceitful and sly, and would sell his slaves any time. Hard bondage--something like the children of Israel,&quot; was his simple excuse for fleeing. He hired his time of his master, for which he was compelled to pay $156 a year. When he lost time by sickness or rainy weather, he was required to make up the deficiency, also find his clothing. He left a wife--Lavinia--and one child, Eliza, both slaves. Peter communicated to his wife his secret intention to leave, and she acquiesced in his going. He left his parents also. All his sisters and brothers had been sold. Peter would have been sold too, but his owner was under the impression, that he was &quot;too good a Christian&quot; to violate the laws by running away. Peter&#39;s master was quite a devoted Methodist, and was attached to the same Church with Peter. While on the subject of religion, Peter was asked about the kind and character of preaching that he had been accustomed to hear; whereupon he gave the following graphic specimen: &quot;Servants obey your masters; good servants make good masters; when your mistress speaks to you don&#39;t pout out your mouths; when you want to go to church ask your mistress and master,&quot; etc., etc. Peter declared, that he had never heard but one preacher speak against slavery, and that &quot;one was obliged to leave suddenly for the North.&quot; He said, that a Quaker lady spoke in meeting against Slavery one day, which resulted in an outbreak, and final breaking up of the meeting.</p><p>PHILLIS GAULT. Phillis was a widow, about thirty years of age; the blood of two races flowed in about equal proportions through her veins. Such was her personal appearance, refinement, manners, and intelligence, that had the facts of her slave life been unknown, she would have readily passed for one who had possessed superior advantages. But the facts in her history proved, that she had been made to feel very keenly the horrifying effects of Slavery; not in the field, for she had never worked there; nor as a common drudge, for she had always been required to fill higher spheres; she was a dress-maker--but not without fear of the auction block. This dreaded destiny was the motive which constrained her to escape with the twenty others; secreted in the hold of a vessel expressly arranged for bringing away slaves. Death had robbed her of her husband at the time that the fever raged so fearfully in Norfolk. This sad event deprived her of the hope she had of being purchased by her husband, as he had intended. She was haunted by the constant thought of again being sold, as she had once been, and as she had witnessed the sale of her sister&#39;s four children after the death of their mother.</p><p>Phillis was, to use her own striking expression in a state of &quot;great horror;&quot; she felt, that nothing would relieve her but freedom. After having fully pondered the prospect of her freedom and the only mode offered by which she could escape, she consented to endure bravely whatever of suffering and trial might fall to her lot in the undertaking--and as was the case with thousands of others, she succeeded. She remained several days in the family of a member of the Committee in Philadelphia, favorably impressing all who saw her. As she had formed a very high opinion of Boston, from having heard it so thoroughly reviled in Norfolk, she desired to go there. The Committee made no objections, gave her a free ticket, etc. From that time to the present, she has ever sustained a good Christian character, and as an industrious, upright, and intelligent woman, she has been and is highly respected by all who know her. The following letter is characteristic of her:</p><pre><code>BOSTON, March 22, 1858.

</code></pre><p>ARRIVALS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES.</p><p>MATILDA MAHONEY,--DR. J.W. PENNINGTON&#39;S BROTHER AND SONS CAPTURED AND CARRIED BACK.</p><p>While many sympathized with the slave in his chains, and freely wept over his destiny, or gave money to help buy his freedom, but few could be found who were willing to take the risk of going into the South, and standing face to face with Slavery, in order to conduct a panting slave to freedom. The undertaking was too fearful to think of in most cases. But there were instances when men and women too, moved by the love of freedom, would take their lives in their hands, beard the lion in his den, and nobly rescue the oppressed. Such an instance is found in the case of Matilda Mahoney, in Baltimore.</p><p>The story of Matilda must be very brief, although it is full of thrilling interest. She was twenty-one years of age in 1854, when she escaped and came to Philadelphia, a handsome young woman, of a light complexion, quite refined in her manners, and in short, possessing great personal attractions. But her situation as a slave was critical, as will be seen.</p><p>Her claimant was Wm. Rigard, of Frederick, Md., who hired her to a Mr. Reese, in Baltimore; in this situation her duties were general housework and nursing. With these labors, she was not, however, so much dissatisfied as she was with other circumstances of a more alarming nature: her old master was tottering on the verge of the grave, and his son, a trader in New Orleans. These facts kept Matilda in extreme anxiety. For two years prior to her escape, the young trader had been trying to influence his father to let him have her for the Southern market; but the old man had not consented. Of course the trader knew quite well, that an &quot;article&quot; of her appearance would command readily a very high price in the New Orleans market. But Matilda&#39;s attractions had won the heart of a young man in the North, one who had known her in Baltimore in earlier days, and this lover was willing to make desperate efforts to rescue her from her perilous situation. Whether or not he had nerve enough to venture down to Baltimore to accompany his intended away on the Underground Rail Road, his presence would not have aided in the case. He had, however, a friend who consented to go to Baltimore on this desperate mission. The friend was James Jefferson, of Providence, R.I. With the strategy of a skilled soldier, Mr. Jefferson hurried to the Monumental City, and almost under the eyes of the slave-holders, and slave-catchers, despite of pro slavery breastworks, seized his prize and speeded her away on the Underground Railway, before her owner was made acquainted with the fact of her intended escape. On Matilda&#39;s arrival at the station in Philadelphia, several other passengers from different points, happened to come to hand just at that time, and gave great solicitude and anxiety to the Committee. Among these were a man and his wife and their four children, (noticed elsewhere), from Maryland. Likewise an interesting and intelligent young girl who had been almost miraculously rescued from the prison-house at Norfolk, and in addition to these, the brother of J.W. Pennington, D.D., with his two sons.</p><p>While it was a great gratification to have travelers coming along so fast, and especially to observe in every countenance, determination, rare manly and womanly bearing, with remarkable intelligence, it must be admitted, that the acting committee felt at the same time, a very lively dread of the slave-hunters, and were on their guard. Arrangements were made to send the fugitives on by different trains, and in various directions. Matilda and all the others with the exception of the father and two sons (relatives of Dr. Pennington) successfully escaped and reached their longed-for haven in a free land. The Penningtons, however, although pains had been taken to apprize the Doctor of the good news of the coming of his kin, whom he had not seen for many, many years, were captured after being in New York some twenty-four hours. In answer to an advisory letter from the secretary of the Committee the following from the Doctor is explicit, relative to his wishes and feelings with regard to their being sent on to New York.</p><pre><code>29 6th AVENUE, NEW YORK, May 24th, 1854.

MY DEAR MR. STILL:--Your kind letter of the 22d inst has come to
hand and I have to thank you for your offices of benevolence to
my bone and my flesh, I have had the pleasure of doing a little
for your brother Peter, but I do not think it an offset. My
burden has been great about these brethren. I hope they have
started on to me. Many thanks, my good friend.

Yours Truly.

J.W.C. PENNINGTON.
</code></pre><p>This letter only served to intensify the deep interest which had already been awakened for the safety of all concerned. At the same time also it made the duty of the Committee clear with regard to forwarding them to N.Y. Immediately, therefore, the Doctor&#39;s brother and sons were furnished with free tickets and were as carefully cautioned as possible with regard to slave-hunters, if encountered on the road. In company with several other Underground Rail Road passengers, under the care of an intelligent guide, all were sent off in due order, looking quite as well as the most respectable of their race from any part of the country. The Committee in New York, with the Doctor, were on the look out of course; thus without difficulty all arrived safely in the Empire City.</p><p>It would seem that the coming of his brother and sons so overpowered the Doctor that he forgot how imminent their danger was. The meeting and interview was doubtless very joyous. Few perhaps could realize, even in imagination, the feelings that filled their hearts, as the Doctor and his brother reverted to their boyhood, when they were both slaves together in Maryland; the separation--the escape of the former many years previous--the contrast, one elevated to the dignity of a Doctor of Divinity, a scholar and noted clergyman, and as such well known in the United States, and Great Britain, whilst, at the same time, his brother and kin were held in chains, compelled to do unrequited labor, to come and go at the bidding of another. Were not these reflections enough to incapacitate the Doctor for the time being, for cool thought as to how he should best guard against the enemy? Indeed, in view of Slavery and its horrid features, the wonder is, not that more was not done, but that any thing was done, that the victims were not driven almost out of their senses. But time rolled on until nearly twenty-four hours had passed, and while reposing their fatigued and weary limbs in bed, just before day-break, hyena-like the slave-hunters pounced upon all three of them, and soon had them hand-cuffed and hurried off to a United States&#39; Commissioner&#39;s office. Armed with the Fugitive Law, and a strong guard of officers to carry it out, resistance would have been simply useless. Ere the morning sun arose the sad news was borne by the telegraph wires to all parts of the country of this awful calamity on the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>Scarcely less painful to the Committee was the news of this accident, than the news of a disaster, resulting in the loss of several lives, on the Camden and Amboy Road, would have been to its managers. This was the first accident that had ever taken place on the road after passengers had reached the Philadelphia Committee, although, in various instances, slave-hunters had been within a hair&#39;s breadth of their prey.</p><p>All that was reported respecting the arrest and return of the Doctor&#39;s kin, so disgraceful to Christianity and civilization, is taken from the Liberator, as follows:</p><pre><code>THREE FUGITIVE SLAVES ARRESTED IN NEW YORK, AND GIVEN UP TO
THEIR OWNERS.

NEW YORK, May 25th.

About three o&#39;clock this morning, three colored men, father and
two sons, known as Jake, Bob, and Stephen Pennington, were
arrested at the instance of David Smith and Jacob Grove, of
Washington Co., Md., who claimed them as their slaves. They were
taken before Commissioner Morton, of the United States Court,
and it was understood that they would be examined at 11 o&#39;clock;
instead of that, however, the case was heard at once, no persons
being present, when the claimnants testified that they were the
owners of said slaves and that they escaped from their service
at Baltimore, on Sunday last.

From what we can gather of the proceedings, the fugitives
acknowledged themselves to be slaves of Smith and Grove. The
commissioner considering the testimony sufficient, ordered their
surrender, and they were accordingly given up to their
claimants, who hurried them off at once, and they are now on
their way to Baltimore. A telegraph despatch has been sent to
Philadelphia, as it is understood an attempt will be made to
rescue the parties, when the cars arrive. There was no
excitement around the commissioner&#39;s office, owing to a
misunderstanding as to the time of examination. The men were
traced to this city by the claimants, who made application to
the United States Court, when officers Horton and De Angeles
were deputied by the marshal to effect their arrest, and those
officers, with deputy Marshal Thompson scoured the city, and
finally found them secreted in a house in Broome St. They were
brought before Commissioner Morton this morning. No counsel
appeared for the fugitives. The case being made out, the usual
affidavits of fear of rescue were made, and the warrants
thereupon issued, and the three fugitives were delivered over to
the U.S. Marshal, and hurried off to Maryland. They were a
father and his two sons, father about forty-five and sons
eighteen or nineteen. The evidence shows them to have recently
escaped. The father is the brother of the Rev. Dr. Pennington, a
highly respected colored preacher of this city.





NEW YORK, May 28.

Last evening the church at the corner of Prince and Marion
streets was filled with an intelligent audience of white and
colored people, to hear Dr. Pennington relate the circumstance
connected with the arrest of his brother and nephews. He showed,
that he attempted to afford his brother the assistance of
counsel, but was unable to do so, the officers at the Marshal&#39;s
office having deceived him in relation to the time the trial was
to take place before the Commissioners. Hon. E.F. Culver next
addressed the audience, showing, that a great injustice had been
done to the brother of Dr. Pennington, and though he, up to that
time, had advocated peace, he now had the spirit to tear down
the building over the Marshal&#39;s head. Intense interest was
manifested during the proceedings, and much sympathy in behalf
of Dr. Pennington.





THE FUGITIVE SLAVES IN BALTIMORE.

The U.S. Marshal, A.T. Hillyer, Esq., received a dispatch this
morning from officers Horton and Dellugelis, at Baltimore,
stating, that they had arrived there with the three slaves,
arrested here yesterday (the Penningtons), the owners
accompanying them. The officers will return to New York, this
evening.--_N.Y. Express_, 27_th_.





NEW YORK, May 30.

The Rev. Dr. Pennington has received a letter from Mr. Grove,
the claimant of his brother, who was recently taken back from
this city, offering to sell him to Dr. Pennington, should he
wish to buy him, and stating, that he would await a reply,
before &quot;selling him to the slave-drivers.&quot; Mr. Groce, who
accompanied his &quot;sweet heart,&quot; Matilda, in the same train which
conveyed the Penningtons to New York, had reason to apprehend
danger to all the Underground Rail Road passengers, as will
appear from his subjoined letter:


    ELMIRA, May 28th.

    DEAR LUKE:--I arrived home safe with my precious charge,
    and found all well. I have just learned, that the
    Penningtons are taken. Had he done as I wished him he
    would never have been taken. Last night our tall friend
    from Baltimore came, and caused great excitement here by
    his information. The lady is perfectly safe now in
    Canada. I will write you and Mr. Still as soon as I get
    over the excitement. This letter was first intended for
    Mr. Gains, but I now send it to you. Please let me hear
    their movements.

    Yours truly,

    C.L. GROCE.
</code></pre><p>But sadly as this blow was felt by the Vigilance Committee, it did not cause them to relax their efforts in the least. Indeed it only served to stir them up to renewed diligence and watchfulness, although for a length of time afterwards the Committee felt disposed, when sending, to avoid New York as much as possible, and in lieu thereof, to send <em>via</em> Elmira, where there was a depot under the agency of John W. Jones. Mr. Jones was a true and prompt friend of the fugitive, and wide-awake with regard to Slavery and slave-holders, and slave hunters, for he had known from sad experience in Virginia every trait of character belonging to these classes.</p><p>In the midst of the Doctor&#39;s grief, friends of the slave soon raised money to purchase his brother, about $1,000; but the unfortunate sons were doomed to the auction block and the far South, where, the writer has never exactly learned.</p><p>&quot;FLEEING GIRL OF FIFTEEN,&quot; IN MALE ATTIRE.</p><p>PROFESSORS H.

It was the business of the Vigilance Committee, as it was clearly understood by the friends of the Slave, to assist all needy fugitives, who might in any way manage to reach Philadelphia, but, for various reasons, not to send agents South to incite slaves to run away, or to assist them in so doing. Sometimes, however, this rule could not altogether be conformed to. Cases, in some instances, would appeal so loudly and forcibly to humanity, civilization, and Christianity, that it would really seem as if the very stones would cry out, unless something was done. As an illustration of this point, the story of the young girl, which is now to be related, will afford the most striking proof. At the same time it may be seen how much anxiety, care, hazard, delay and material aid, were required in order to effect the deliverance of some who were in close places, and difficult of access. It will be necessary to present a considerable amount of correspondence in this case, to bring to light the hidden mysteries of this narrative. The first letter, in explanation, is the following:</p><p>LETTER FROM J. BIGELOW, ESQ.</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., June 27, 1854.

MR. WM. STILL--_Dear Sir_:--I have to thank you for the prompt
answer you had the kindness to give to my note of 22d inst.
Having found a correspondence so quick and easy, and withal so
very flattering, I address you again more fully.

The liberal appropriation for _transportation_ has been made
chiefly on account of a female child of ten or eleven years old,
for whose purchase I have been authorized to offer $700
(refused), and for whose sister I have paid $1,600, and some
$1,000 for their mother, &amp;c.

This child sleeps in the same apartment with its master and
mistress, which adds to the difficulty of removal. She is some
ten or twelve miles from the city, so that really the chief
hazard will be in bringing her safely to town, and in secreting
her until a few days of _storm_ shall have abated. All this, I
think, is now provided for with entire safety.

The child has two cousins in the immediate vicinity; a young man
of some twenty-two years of age, and his sister, of perhaps
seventeen--_both Slaves_, but bright and clear-headed as
anybody. The young man I have seen often--the services of _both_
seem indispensable to the main object suggested; but having once
rendered the service, they cannot, and ought not return to
Slavery. They look for _freedom_ as the reward of what they
shall now do.

Out of the $300, cheerfully offered for the whole enterprise, I
must pay some reasonable sum for transportation to the city and
sustenance while here. It cannot be much; for the balance, I
shall give a draft, which will be _promptly paid_ on their
arrival in New York.

If I have been understood to offer the whole $300, _it shall be
paid_, though I have meant as above stated. Among the various
ways that have been suggested, has been that of taking _all of
them_ into the cars here; that, I think, will be found
impracticable. I find so much vigilance at the depot, that I
would not deem it safe, though, in any kind of carriage they
might leave in safety at any time.

All the rest I leave to the experience and sagacity of the
gentleman who maps out the enterprise.

Now I will thank you to reply to this and let me know that it
reaches you in safety, and is not put in a careless place,
whereby I may be endangered; and state also, whether all my
propositions are understood and acceptable, and whether, (pretty
quickly after I shall inform you that _all things are ready_),
the gentleman will make his appearance?

I live alone. My office and bed-room, &amp;c., are at the corner of
E. and 7th streets, opposite the east end of the General Post
Office, where any one may call upon me.

It would, of course, be imprudent, that this letter, or any
other _written_ particulars, be in his pockets for fear of
accident.

Yours very respectfully,

J. BIGELOW.
</code></pre><p>While this letter clearly brought to light the situation of things, its author, however, had scarcely begun to conceive of the numberless difficulties which stood in the way of success before the work could be accomplished. The information which Mr. Bigelow&#39;s letter contained of the painful situation of this young girl was submitted to different parties who could be trusted, with a view of finding a person who might possess sufficient courage to undertake to bring her away. Amongst those consulted were two or three captains who had on former occasions done good service in the cause. One of these captains was known in Underground Rail-Road circles as the &quot;powder boy.&quot;[A] He was willing to undertake the work, and immediately concluded to make a visit to Washington, to see how the &quot;land lay.&quot; Accordingly in company with another Underground Rail Road captain, he reported himself one day to Mr. Bigelow with as much assurance as if he were on an errand for an office under the government. The impression made on Mr. Bigelow&#39;s mind may be seen from the following letter; it may also be seen that he was fully alive to the necessity of precautionary measures.</p><p>[Footnote A: He had been engaged at different times in carrying powder in his boat from a powder magazine, and from this circumstance, was familiarly called the &quot;Powder Boy.&quot;]</p><p>SECOND LETTER FROM LAWYER BIGELOW.</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., September 9th, 1855.

MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I strongly hope the little matter of
business so long pending and about which I have written you so
many times, will take a move now. I have the promise that the
merchandize shall be delivered in this city to-night. Like so
many other promises, this also may prove a failure, though I
have reason to believe that it will not. I shall, however, know
before I mail this note. In case the goods arrive here I shall
hope to see your long-talked of &quot;Professional gentleman&quot; in
Washington, as soon as possible. He will find me by the enclosed
card, which shall be a satisfactory introduction for him. You
have never given me his name, nor am I anxious to know it. But
on a pleasant visit made last fall to friend Wm. Wright, in
Adams Co., I suppose I accidentally learned it to be a certain
Dr. H----. Well, let him come.

I had an interesting call a week ago from two gentlemen, masters
of vessels, and brothers, one of whom, I understand, you know as
the &quot;powder boy.&quot; I had a little light freight for them; but not
finding enough other freight to ballast their craft, they went
down the river looking for wheat, and promising to return soon.
I hope to see them often.

I hope this may find you returned from your northern trip,[A] as
your time proposed was out two or three days ago.

[Footnote A: Mr. Bigelow&#39;s correspondent had been on a visit to
the fugitives to Canada.]

I hope if the whole particulars of Jane Johnson&#39;s case[B] are
printed, you will send me the copy as proposed.

[Footnote B: Jane Johnson of the Passmore Williamson Slave
Case.]

I forwarded some of her things to Boston a few days ago, and had
I known its importance in court, I could have sent you one or
two witnesses who would prove that her freedom was intended by
her before she left Washington, and that a man was _engaged_
here to go on to Philadelphia the same day with her to give
notice there of her case, though I think he failed to do so. It
was beyond all question her purpose, _before leaving Washington
and provable too_, that if Wheeler should make her a free woman
by taking her to a free state &quot;_to use it rather_.&quot;

Tuesday, 11th September. The attempt was made on Sunday to
forward the merchandize, but failed through no fault of any of
the parties that I now know of. It will be repeated soon, and
you shall know the result.

&quot;Whorra for Judge Kane.&quot; I feel so indignant at the man, that it
is not easy to write the foregoing sentence, and yet who is
helping our cause like Kane and Douglas, not forgetting
Stringfellow. I hope soon to know that this reaches you in
safety.

It often happens that light freight would be offered to Captain
B., but the owners cannot by possibility _advance_ the amount of
freight. I wish it were possible in some such extreme cases,
that after advancing _all they have_, some public fund should be
found to pay the balance or at least lend it.

[I wish here to caution you against the supposition that I would
do any act, or say a word towards helping servants to escape.
Although I hate slavery so much, I keep my hands clear of any
such wicked or illegal act.]

Yours, very truly,

J.B.

Will you recollect, hereafter, that in any of my future letters,
in which I may use [] whatever words may be within the brackets
are intended to have no signification whatever to you, only to
blind the eyes of the uninitiated. You will find an example at
the close of my letter.
</code></pre><p>Up to this time the chances seemed favorable of procuring the ready services of either of the above mentioned captains who visited Lawyer Bigelow for the removal of the merchandize to Philadelphia, providing the shipping master could have it in readiness to suit their convenience. But as these captains had a number of engagements at Richmond, Petersburg, &amp;c., it was not deemed altogether safe to rely upon either of them, consequently in order to be prepared in case of an emergency, the matter was laid before two professional gentlemen who were each occupying chairs in one of the medical colleges of Philadelphia. They were known to be true friends of the slave, and had possessed withal some experience in Underground Rail Road matters. Either of these professors was willing to undertake the operation, provided arrangements could be completed in time to be carried out during the vacation. In this hopeful, although painfully indefinite position the matter remained for more than a year; but the correspondence and anxiety increased, and with them disappointments and difficulties multiplied. The hope of Freedom, however, buoyed up the heart of the young slave girl during the long months of anxious waiting and daily expectation for the hour of deliverance to come. Equally true and faithful also did Mr. Bigelow prove to the last; but at times he had some painfully dark seasons to encounter, as may be seen from the subjoined letter:</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., October 6th, 1855.

MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I regret exceedingly to learn by your
favor of 4th instant, that all things are not ready. Although I
cannot speak of any immediate and positive danger. [_Yet it is
well known that the city is full of incendiaries_.]

Perhaps you are aware that any colored citizen is liable at any
hour of day or night without any show of authority to have his
house ransacked by constables, and if others do it and commit
the most outrageous depredations none but white witnesses can
convict them. Such outrages are always common here, and no kind
of property exposed to colored protection only, can be
considered safe. [I don&#39;t say that _much liberty_ should not be
given to constables on account of numerous runaways, but it
don&#39;t always work for good.] Before advertising they go round
and offer rewards to sharp colored men of perhaps _one or two
hundred dollars_, to betray runaways, and having discovered
their hiding-place, seize them and then cheat their informers
out of the money.

[_Although a law-abiding man_,] I am anxious in this case of
_innocence_ to raise no conflict or suspicion. [_Be sure that
the manumission is full and legal_.] And as I am _powerless_
without your aid, _I pray you_ don&#39;t lose a moment in giving me
relief. The idea of waiting yet for weeks seems dreadful; do
reduce it to days if possible, and give me notice of the
_earliest possible time_.

The property is not yet advertised, but will be, [and if we
delay too long, may be sold and lost.]

It was a great misunderstanding, though not your fault, that so
much delay would be necessary. [I repeat again that I must have
the thing done legally, therefore, please get a good lawyer to
draw up the deed of manumission.]

Yours Truly,

J. BIGELOW.
</code></pre><p>Great was the anxiety felt in Washington. It is certainly not too much to say, that an equal amount of anxiety existed in Philadelphia respecting the safety of the merchandise. At this juncture Mr. Bigelow had come to the conclusion that it was no longer safe to write over his own name, but that he would do well to henceforth adopt the name of the renowned Quaker, Wm. Penn, (he was worthy of it) as in the case of the following letter.</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., November 10th, 1855.

DEAR SIR:--Doctor T. presented my card last night about half
past eight which I instantly recognized. I, however, soon became
suspicious, and afterwards confounded, to find the doctor using
your name and the well known names of Mr. McK. and Mr. W. and
yet, neither he nor I, could conjecture the object of his visit.

The doctor is agreeable and sensible, and doubtless a
true-hearted man. He seemed to see the whole matter as I did,
and was embarrassed. He had nothing to propose, no information
to give of the &quot;P. Boy,&quot; or of any substitute, and seemed to
want no particular information from me concerning my anxieties
and perils, though I stated them to him, but found him as
powerless as myself to give me relief. I had an agreeable
interview with the doctor till after ten, when he left,
intending to take the cars at six, as I suppose he did do, this
morning.

This morning after eight, I got your letter of the 9th, but it
gives me but little enlightenment or satisfaction. You simply
say that the doctor is a _true man_, which I cannot doubt, that
you thought it best we should have an interview, and that you
supposed I would meet the expenses. You informed me also that
the &quot;P. Boy&quot; left for Richmond, on Friday, the 2d, to be gone
_the length of time named in your last_, I must infer that to be
_ten days_ though in your last _you assured me_ that the &quot;P.
Boy&quot; would certainly start for _this place_ (not Richmond) in
two or three days, though the difficulty about freight might
cause delay, and the whole enterprise might not be accomplished
under ten days, &amp;c., &amp;c. That time having elapsed and I having
agreed to an extra fifty dollars to ensure promptness. I have
scarcely left my office since, except for my hasty meals,
awaiting his arrival. You now inform me he has gone to Richmond,
to be gone ten days, which will expire tomorrow, but you do not
say he will return here or to Phila, or where, at the expiration
of that time, and Dr. T. could tell me nothing whatever about
him. Had he been able to tell me that this _best plan_, which I
have so long rested upon, would fail, or was abandoned, I could
then understand it, but he says no such thing, and you say, as
you have twice before said, &quot;ten days more.&quot;

Now, my dear sir, after this recapitulation, can you not see
that I have reason for great embarrassment? I have given
assurances, both here and in New York, founded on your
assurances to me, and caused my friends in the latter place
great anxiety, so much that I have had no way to explain my own
letters but by sending your last two to Mr. Tappan.

I cannot doubt, I do not, but that you wish to help me, and the
cause too, for which both of us have made many and large
sacrifices with no hope of reward in this world. If in this case
I have been very urgent since September Dr. T. can give you some
of my reasons, they have not been selfish.

The whole matter is in a nutshell. Can I, in your opinion,
depend on the &quot;P. Boy,&quot; and when?

If he promises to come here next trip, will he come, or go to
Richmond? This I think is the best way. Can I depend on it?

Dr. T. promised to write me some explanation and give some
advice, and at first I thought to await his letter, but on
second thought concluded to tell you how I feel, as I have done.

Will you answer my questions with some explicitness, and without
delay?

I forgot to inquire of Dr. T. who is the head of your Vigilance
Committee, whom I may address concerning other and further
operations?

Yours very truly,

WM. PENN.

P.S. I ought to say, that I have no doubt but there were good
reasons for the P. Boy&#39;s going to Richmond instead of W.; _but
what can they be_?
</code></pre><p>Whilst there are a score of other interesting letters, bearing on this case, the above must suffice, to give at least, an idea of the perplexities and dangers attending its early history. Having accomplished this end, a more encouraging and pleasant phase of the transaction may now be introduced. Here the difficulties, at least very many of them, vanish, yet in one respect, the danger became most imminent. The following letter shows that the girl had been successfully rescued from her master, and that a reward of five hundred dollars had been offered for her.</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., October 12, 1855.

</code></pre><p>Having thus succeeded in getting possession of, and secreting this fleeing child of fifteen, as best they could, in Washington, all concerned were compelled to &quot;possess their souls in patience,&quot; until the storm had passed. Meanwhile, the &quot;child of fifteen&quot; was christened &quot;Joe Wright,&quot; and dressed in male attire to prepare for traveling as a lad. As no opportunity had hitherto presented itself, whereby to prepare the &quot;package&quot; for shipment, from Washington, neither the &quot;powder boy&quot; nor Dr. T.[B] was prepared to attend to the removal, at this critical moment. The emergency of the case, however, cried loudly for aid. The other professional gentleman (Dr. H.), was now appealed to, but his engagements in the college forbade his absence before about Thanksgiving day, which was then six weeks off. This fact was communicated to Washington, and it being the only resource left, the time named was necessarily acquiesced in. In the interim, &quot;Joe&quot; was to perfect herself in the art of wearing pantaloons, and all other male rig. Soon the days and weeks slid by, although at first the time for waiting seemed long, when, according to promise, Dr. H. was in Washington, with his horse and buggy prepared for duty. The impressions made by Dr. H., on William Penn&#39;s mind, at his first interview, will doubtless be interesting to all concerned, as may be seen in the following letter:</p><p>[Footnote B: Dr. T. was one of the professional gentlemen alluded to above, who had expressed a willingness to act as an agent in the matter.]</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., November 26, 1855.

MY DEAR SIR:--A recent letter from my friend, probably has led
you to expect this from me. He was delighted to receive yours of
the 23d, stating that the boy was _all right_. He found the
&quot;Prof. gentleman&quot; a _perfect gentleman_; cool, quiet,
thoughtful, and _perfectly competent to execute his
undertaking_. At the first three minutes of their interview, he
felt assured that all would be right. He, and all concerned,
give you and that gentleman sincere thanks for what you have
done. May the blessings of Him, who cares for the poor, be on
your heads.

The especial object of this, is to inform you that there is a
half dozen or so of packages here, _pressing for
transportation_; twice or thrice that number are also pressing,
but less so than the others. Their aggregate means will average,
say, $10 each; besides these, we know of a few, say three or
four, _able and smart_, but utterly destitute, and kept so
purposely by their oppressors. For all these, we feel deeply
interested; $10 each would not be enough for the &quot;powder boy.&quot;
Is there any fund from which a pittance could be spared to help
these poor creatures? I don&#39;t doubt but that they would honestly
repay a small loan as soon as they could earn it. I know full
well, that if you begin with such cases, there is no boundary at
which you can stop. For years, one half at least, of my friend&#39;s
time here has been gratuitously given to cases of distress among
this class. He never expects or desires to do less; he literally
has the _poor always with him_. He knows that it is so with you
also, therefore, he only states the case, being especially
anxious for at least those to whom I have referred.

[Illustration: MARIA WEEMS ESCAPING IN MALE ATTIRE]

I think a small lot of hard coal might always be sold here _from
the vessel_ at a profit. Would not a like lot of Cumberland coal
always sell in Philadelphia?

My friend would be very glad to see the powder boy here again,
and if he brings coal, there are those here, who would try to
help him sell.

Everything having been duly arranged, the doctor&#39;s horse and carriage stood waiting before the White House (William Penn preferred this place as a starting point, rather than before his own office door). It being understood that &quot;Joe&quot; was to act as coachman in passing out of Washington, at this moment he was called for, and in the most polite and natural manner, with the fleetness of a young deer, he jumped into the carriage, took the reins and whip, whilst the doctor and William Penn were cordially shaking hands and bidding adieu. This done, the order was given to Joe, &quot;drive on.&quot; Joe bravely obeyed. The faithful horse trotted off willingly, and the doctor sat in his carriage as composed as though he had succeeded in procuring an honorable and lucrative office from the White House, and was returning home to tell his wife the good news. The doctor had some knowledge of the roads, also some acquaintances in Maryland, through which State he had to travel; therefore, after leaving the suburbs of Washington, the doctor took the reins in his own hands, as he felt that he was more experienced as a driver than his young coachman. He was also mindful of the fact, that, before reaching Pennsylvania, his faithful beast would need feeding several times, and that they consequently would be obliged to pass one or two nights at least in Maryland, either at a tavern or farm-house.</p><p>In reflecting upon the matter, it occurred to the doctor, that in earlier days, he had been quite intimately acquainted with a farmer and his family (who were slave-holders), in Maryland, and that he would about reach their house at the end of the first day&#39;s journey. He concluded that he could do no better than to renew his acquaintance with his old friends on this occasion. After a very successful day&#39;s travel, night came on, and the doctor was safely at the farmer&#39;s door with his carriage and waiter boy; the doctor was readily recognized by the farmer and his family, who seemed glad to see him; indeed, they made quite a &quot;fuss&quot; over him. As a matter of strategy, the doctor made quite a &quot;fuss&quot; over them in return; nevertheless, he did not fail to assume airs of importance, which were calculated to lead them to think that he had grown older and wiser than when they knew him in his younger days. In casually referring to the manner of his traveling, he alluded to the fact, that he was not very well, and as it had been a considerable length of time since he had been through that part of the country, he thought that the drive would do him good, and especially the sight of old familiar places and people. The farmer and his family felt themselves exceedingly honored by the visit from the distinguished doctor, and manifested a marked willingness to spare no pains to render his night&#39;s lodging in every way comfortable.</p><p>The Dr. being an educated and intelligent gentleman, well posted on other questions besides medicine, could freely talk about farming in all its branches, and &quot;niggers&quot; too, in an emergency, so the evening passed off pleasantly with the Dr. in the parlor, and &quot;Joe&quot; in the kitchen. The Dr., however, had given &quot;Joe&quot; precept upon precept, &quot;here a little, and there a little,&quot; as to how he should act in the presence of master white people, or slave colored people, and thus he was prepared to act his part with due exactness. Before the evening grew late, the Dr., fearing some accident, intimated, that he was feeling a &quot;little languid,&quot; and therefore thought that he had better &quot;retire.&quot; Furthermore he added, that he was &quot;liable to vertigo,&quot; when not quite well, and for this reason he must have his boy &quot;Joe&quot; sleep in the room with him. &quot;Simply give him a bed quilt and he will fare well enough in one corner of the room,&quot; said the Dr. The proposal was readily acceded to, and carried into effect by the accommodating host. The Dr. was soon in bed, sleeping soundly, and &quot;Joe,&quot; in his new coat and pants, wrapped up in the bed quilt, in a corner of the room quite comfortably.</p><p>The next morning the Dr. arose at as early an hour as was prudent for a gentleman of his position, and feeling refreshed, partook of a good breakfast, and was ready, with his boy, &quot;Joe,&quot; to prosecute their journey. Face, eyes, hope, and steps, were set as flint, Pennsylvania-ward. What time the following day or night they crossed Mason and Dixon&#39;s line is not recorded on the Underground Rail Road books, but at four o&#39;clock on Thanksgiving Day, the Dr. safely landed the &quot;fleeing girl of fifteen&quot; at the residence of the writer in Philadelphia. On delivering up his charge, the Dr. simply remarked to the writer&#39;s wife, &quot;I wish to leave this young lad with you a short while, and I will call and see further about him.&quot; Without further explanation, he stepped into his carriage and hurried away, evidently anxious to report himself to his wife, in order to relieve her mind of a great weight of anxiety on his account. The writer, who happened to be absent from home when the Dr. called, returned soon afterwards. &quot;The Dr. has been here&quot; (he was the family physician), &quot;and left this &#39;young lad,&#39; and said, that he would call again and see about him,&quot; said Mrs. S. The &quot;young lad&quot; was sitting quite composedly in the dining-room, with his cap on. The writer turned to him and inquired, &quot;I suppose you are the person that the Dr. went to Washington after, are you not?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said &quot;Joe.&quot; &quot;Where are you from then?&quot; was the next question. &quot;From York, sir.&quot; &quot;From York? Why then did the Dr. bring you here?&quot; was the next query, &quot;the Dr. went expressly to Washington after a young girl, who was to be brought away dressed up as a boy, and I took you to be the person.&quot; Without replying &quot;the lad&quot; arose and walked out of the house. The querist, somewhat mystified, followed him, and then when the two were alone, &quot;the lad&quot; said, &quot;I am the one the Dr. went after.&quot; After congratulating her, the writer asked why she had said, that she was not from Washington, but from York. She explained, that the Dr. had strictly charged her not to own to any person, except the writer, that she was from Washington, but from York. As there were persons present (wife, hired girl, and a fugitive woman), when the questions were put to her, she felt that it would be a violation of her pledge to answer in the affirmative. Before this examination, neither of the individuals present for a moment entertained the slightest doubt but that she was a &quot;lad,&quot; so well had she acted her part in every particular. She was dressed in a new suit, which fitted her quite nicely, and with her unusual amount of common sense, she appeared to be in no respect lacking. To send off a prize so rare and remarkable, as she was, without affording some of the stockholders and managers of the Road the pleasure of seeing her, was not to be thought of. In addition to the Vigilance Committee, quite a number of persons were invited to see her, and were greatly astonished. Indeed it was difficult to realize, that she was not a boy, even after becoming acquainted with the facts in the case.</p><p>The following is an exact account of this case, as taken from the Underground Rail Road records:</p><pre><code>&quot;THANKSGIVING DAY, Nov., 1855.

Arrived, Ann Maria Weems, _alias_ &#39;Joe Wright,&#39; _alias_ &#39;Ellen
Capron,&#39; from Washington, through the aid of Dr. H. She is about
fifteen years of age, bright mulatto, well grown, smart and
good-looking. For the last three years, or about that length of
time, she has been owned by Charles M. Price, a negro trader, of
Rockville, Maryland. Mr. P. was given to &#39;intemperance,&#39; to a
very great extent, and gross &#39;profanity.&#39; He buys and sells many
slaves in the course of the year. &#39;His wife is cross and
peevish.&#39; She used to take great pleasure in &#39;torturing&#39; one
&#39;little slave boy.&#39; He was the son of his master (and was owned
by him); this was the chief cause of the mistress&#39; spite.&quot;

Ann Maria had always desired her freedom from childhood, and
although not thirteen, when first advised to escape, she
received the suggestion without hesitation, and ever after that
time waited almost daily, for more than two years, the chance to
flee. Her friends were, of course, to aid her, and make
arrangements for her escape. Her owner, fearing that she might
escape, for a long time compelled her to sleep in the chamber
with &quot;her master and mistress;&quot; indeed she was so kept until
about three weeks before she fled. She left her parents living
in Washington. Three of her brothers had been sold South from
their parents. Her mother had been purchased for $1,000, and one
of her sisters for $1,600 for freedom. Before Ann Maria was
thirteen years of age $700 was offered for her by a friend, who
desired to procure her freedom, but the offer was promptly
refused, as were succeeding ones repeatedly made. The only
chance of procuring her freedom, depended upon getting her away
on the Underground Rail Road. She was neatly attired in male
habiliments, and in that manner came all the way from
Washington. After passing two or three days with her new friends
in Philadelphia, she was sent on (in male attire) to Lewis
Tappan, of New York, who had likewise been deeply interested in
her case from the beginning, and who held himself ready, as was
understood, to cash a draft for three hundred dollars to
compensate the man who might risk his own liberty in bringing
her on from Washington. After having arrived safely in New York,
she found a home and kind friends in the family of the Rev. A.N.
Freeman, and received quite an ovation characteristic of an
Underground Rail Road.

After having received many tokens of esteem and kindness from
the friends of the slave in New York and Brooklyn, she was
carefully forwarded on to Canada, to be educated at the &quot;Buxton
Settlement.&quot;
</code></pre><p>An interesting letter, however, from the mother of Ann Maria, conveying the intelligence of her late great struggle and anxiety in laboring to free her last child from Slavery is too important to be omitted, and hence is inserted in connection with this narrative.</p><p>LETTER FROM THE MOTHER.</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., September 19th, 1857.

WM. STILL, ESQ., Philadelphia, Pa. SIR:--I have just sent for my
son Augustus, in Alabama. I have sent eleven hundred dollars
which pays for his body and some thirty dollars to pay his fare
to Washington. I borrowed one hundred and eighty dollars to make
out the eleven hundred dollars. I was not very successful in
Syracuse. I collected only twelve dollars, and in Rochester only
two dollars. I did not know that the season was so unpropitious.
The wealthy had all gone to the springs. They must have returned
by this time. I hope you will exert yourself and help me get a
part of the money I owe, at least. I am obliged to pay it by the
12th of next month. I was unwell when I returned through
Philadelphia, or I should have called. I had been from home five
weeks.

My son Augustus is the last of the family in Slavery. I feel
rejoiced that he is soon to be free and with me, and of course
feel the greatest solicitude about raising the one hundred and
eighty dollars I have borrowed of a kind friend, or who has
borrowed it for me at bank. I hope and pray you will help me as
far as possible. Tell Mr. Douglass to remember me, and if he
can, to interest his friends for me.

You will recollect that five hundred dollars of our money was
taken to buy the sister of Henry H. Garnett&#39;s wife. Had I been
able to command this I should not be necessitated to ask the
favors and indulgences I do.

I am expecting daily the return of Augustus, and may Heaven
grant him a safe deliverance and smile propitiously upon you and
all kind friends who have aided in his return to me.

Be pleased to remember me to friends, and accept yourself the
blessing and prayers of your dear friend,

EARRO WEEMS.

P.S. Direct your letter to E.L. Stevens, in Duff Green&#39;s Row,
Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.

</code></pre><p>That William Penn who worked so faithfully for two years for the deliverance of Ann Maria may not appear to have been devoting all his time and sympathy towards this single object it seems expedient that two or three additional letters, proposing certain grand Underground Rail Road plans, should have a place here. For this purpose, therefore, the following letters are subjoined.</p><p>LETTERS FROM WILLIAM PENN.</p><pre><code>WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 3, 1854

DEAR SIR:--I address you to-day chiefly at the suggestion of the
Lady who will hand you my letter, and who is a resident of your
city.

After stating to you, that the case about which I have
previously written, remains just as it was when I wrote
last--full of difficulty--I thought I would call your attention
to another enterprise; it is this: to find a man with a large
heart for doing good to the oppressed, who will come to
Washington to live, and who will _walk out to Penn&#39;a., or a part
of the way there, once or twice a week_. He will find parties
who will _pay him for doing so_. Parties of say, two, three,
five or so, who will pay him _at least_ $5 each, for the
privilege of following him, but _will never speak to him_; but
will keep just in sight of him and obey any sign he may give;
say, he takes off his hat and scratches his head as a sign for
them to go to some barn or wood to rest, &amp;c. No living being
shall be found to say he ever spoke to them. A white man would
be best, and then even parties led out by him could not, if they
would, testify to any _understanding_ or anything else against a
white man. I think he might make a good living at it. Can it not
be done?

If one or two safe stopping-places could be found on the
way--such as a barn or shed, they could walk quite safely all
night and then sleep all day--about two, or _easily_ three
nights would convey them to a place of safety. The traveler
might be a peddler or huckster, with an old horse and cart, and
bring us in eggs and butter if he pleases.

Let him once plan out his route, and he might then take ten or a
dozen at a time, and they are often able and willing to pay $10
a piece.

I have a hard case now on hand; a brother and sister 23 to 25
years old, whose mother lives in your city. They are cruelly
treated; they want to go, they _ought_ to go; but they are
utterly destitute. Can nothing be done for such cases? If you
can think of anything let me know it. I suppose you know me?





WASHINGTON, D.C., April 3, 1856.

DEAR SIR:--I sent you the recent law of Virginia, under which
all vessels are to be searched for fugitives within the waters
of that State.

It was long ago suggested by a sagacious friend, that the
&quot;powder boy&quot; might find a better port in the Chesapeake bay, or
in the Patuxent river to communicate with this vicinity, than by
entering the Potomac river, even were there no such law.

Suppose he opens a trade with some place south-west of
Annapolis, 25 or 30 miles from here, or less. He might carry
wood, oysters, &amp;c., and all his customers from this vicinity
might travel in _that direction_ without any of the suspicions
that might attend their journeyings _towards this city_. In this
way, doubtless, a good business might be carried on without
interruption or competition, and provided the plan was conducted
without affecting the inhabitants along that shore, no suspicion
would arise as to the manner or magnitude of his business
operations. How does this strike you? What does the &quot;powder boy&quot;
think of it?

I heretofore intimated a _pressing necessity_ on the part of
several females--they are variously situated--two have children,
say a couple each; some have none--of the latter, one can raise
$50, another, say 30 or 40 dollars--another who was gazetted
last August (a copy sent you), can raise, through her friends,
20 or 30 dollars, &amp;c., &amp;c. None of these can walk so far or so
fast as scores of _men_ that are constantly leaving. I cannot
shake off my anxiety for these poor creatures. Can you think of
anything for any of these? Address your other correspondent in
answer to this at your leisure.

Yours,

WM. PENN.

P.S.--April 3d. Since writing the above, I have received yours
of 31st. I am rejoiced to hear that business is so successful
and prosperous--may it continue till _the article_ shall cease
to be merchandize.

I spoke in my last letter of the departure of a &quot;few friends.&quot; I
have since heard of their good health in Penn&#39;a. Probably you
may have seen them.

In reference to the expedition of which you think you can &quot;hold
out some little encouragement,&quot; I will barely remark, that I
shall be glad, if it is undertaken, to have all the notice of
the _time and manner_ that is possible, so as to make ready.

A friend of mine says, anthracite coal will always pay here from
Philadelphia, and thinks a small vessel might run often--that
she never would be searched in the Potomac, unless she went
outside.

You advise caution towards Mr. P. I am precisely of your opinion
about him, that he is a &quot;queer stick,&quot; and while I advised him
carefully in reference to his own undertakings, I took no
counsel of him concerning mine.

Yours,

W.P.





WASHINGTON, D.C., April 23d, 1856.

DEAR SIR:--I have to thank you for your last two encouraging
letters of 31st of March and 7th April. I have seen nothing in
the papers to interest you, and having bad health and a press of
other engagements, I have neglected to write you.

Enclosed is a list of persons referred to in my last letter, all
most anxious to travel--all meritorious. In some of these I feel
an especial interest for what they have done to help others in
distress.

I suggest for yours and the &quot;powder boy&#39;s&quot; consideration the
following plan: that he shall take in coal for Washington and
come directly here--sell his coal and go to Georgetown for
freight, and _wait_ for it. If any fancy articles are sent on
board, _I understand he has a place_ to put them in, and _if he
has_ I suggest that he lies still, still waiting for freight
till the first anxiety is over. Vessels that have _just left_
are the ones that will be inquired after, and perhaps chased. If
he lays still a day or two all suspicion will be prevented. If
there shall be occasion to refer to any of them hereafter, it
may be by their numbers in the list.

The family--5 to 11--will be missed and inquired after soon and
urgently; 12 and 13 will also be soon missed, but _none of the
others_.

If all this can be done, some little time or notice must be had
to get them all ready. They tell me they can pay the sums marked
to their names. The aggregate is small, but as I told you, they
are poor. Let me hear from you when convenient.

[Illustration: JOHN HENRY HILL]

Truly Yours,

WM. PENN.

</code></pre><p>FIVE YEARS AND ONE MONTH SECRETED.</p><p>JOHN HENRY, HEZEKIAH, AND JAMES HILL.--JOHN MAKES A DESPERATE RESISTANCE AT THE SLAVE AUCTION AND ESCAPES AFTER BEING SECRETED NINE MONTHS. HEZEKIAH ESCAPED FROM A TRADER AND WAS SECEETED THIRTEEN MONTHS BEFORE HIS FINAL DELIVERANCE.--JAMES WAS SECRETED THREE YEARS IN A PLACE OF GREAT SUFFERING, AND ESCAPED. IN ALL FIVE YEARS AND ONE MONTH.</p><p>Many letters from JOHN HENRY show how incessantly his mind ran out towards the oppressed, and the remarkable intelligence and ability he displayed with the pen, considering that he had no chance to acquire book knowledge. After having fled for refuge to Canada and having become a partaker of impartial freedom under the government of Great Britain, to many it seemed that the fugitive should be perfectly satisfied. Many appeared to think that the fugitive, having secured freedom, had but little occasion for anxiety or care, even for his nearest kin. &quot;Change your name.&quot; &quot;Never tell any one how you escaped.&quot; &quot;Never let any one know where you came from.&quot; &quot;Never think of writing back, not even to your wife; you can do your kin no good, but may do them harm by writing.&quot; &quot;Take care of yourself.&quot; &quot;You are free, well, be satisfied then.&quot; &quot;It will do you no good to fret about your wife and children; that will not get them out of Slavery.&quot; Such was the advice often given to the fugitive. Men who had been slaves themselves, and some who had aided in the escape of individuals, sometimes urged these sentiments on men and women whose hearts were almost breaking over the thought that their dearest and best friends were in chains in the prison-house. Perhaps it was thoughtlessness on the part of some, and a wish to inspire due cautiousness on the part of others, that prompted this advice. Doubtless some did soon forget their friends. They saw no way by which they could readily communicate with them. Perhaps Slavery had dealt with them so cruelly, that little hope or aspiration was left in them.</p><p>It was, however, one of the most gratifying facts connected with the fugitives, the strong love and attachment that they constantly expressed for their relatives left in the South; the undying faith they had in God as evinced by their touching appeals on behalf of their fellow-slaves. But few probably are aware how deeply these feelings were cherished in the breasts of this people. Forty, fifty, or sixty years, in some instances elapsed, but this ardent sympathy and love continued warm and unwavering as ever. Children left to the cruel mercy of slave-holders, could never be forgotten. Brothers and sisters could not refrain from weeping over the remembrance of their separation on the auction block: of having seen innocent children, feeble and defenceless women in the grasp of a merciless tyrant, pleading, groaning, and crying in vain for pity. Not to remember those thus bruised and mangled, it would seem alike unnatural, and impossible. Therefore it is a source of great satisfaction to be able, in relating these heroic escapes, to present the evidences of the strong affections of this greatly oppressed race.</p><p>JOHN HENRY never forgot those with whom he had been a fellow-sufferer in Slavery; he was always fully awake to their wrongs, and longed to be doing something to aid and encourage such as were striving to get their Freedom. He wrote many letters in behalf of others, as well as for himself, the tone of which, was always marked by the most zealous devotion to the slave, a high sense of the value of Freedom, and unshaken confidence that God was on the side of the oppressed, and a strong hope, that the day was not far distant, when the slave power would be &quot;suddenly broken and that without remedy.&quot;</p><p>Notwithstanding the literary imperfections of these letters, they are deemed well suited to these pages. Of course, slaves were not allowed book learning. Virginia even imprisoned white women for teaching free colored children the alphabet. Who has forgotten the imprisonment of Mrs. Douglass for this offense? In view of these facts, no apology is needed on account of Hill&#39;s grammar and spelling.</p><p>In these letters, may be seen, how much liberty was valued, how the taste of Freedom moved the pen of the slave; how the thought of fellow-bondmen, under the heel of the slave-holder, aroused the spirit of indignation and wrath; how importunately appeals were made for help from man and from God; how much joy was felt at the arrival of a fugitive, and the intense sadness experienced over the news of a failure or capture of a slave. Not only are the feelings of John Henry Hill represented in these epistles, but the feelings of very many others amongst the intelligent fugitives all over the country are also represented to the letter. It is more with a view of doing justice to a brave, intelligent class, whom the public are ignorant of, than merely to give special prominence to John and his relatives as individuals, that these letters are given.</p><p>ESCAPE OF JOHN HENRY HILL FROM THE SLAVE AUCTION IN RICHMOND, ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY, 1853.</p><p>JOHN HENRY at that time, was a little turned of twenty-five years of age, full six feet high, and remarkably well proportioned in every respect. He was rather of a brown color, with marked intellectual features. John was by trade, a carpenter, and was considered a competent workman. The year previous to his escape, he hired his time, for which he paid his owner $150. This amount John had fully settled up the last day of the year. As he was a young man of steady habits, a husband and father, and withal an ardent lover of Liberty; his owner, John Mitchell, evidently observed these traits in his character, and concluded that he was a dangerous piece of property to keep; that his worth in money could be more easily managed than the man. Consequently, his master unceremoniously, without intimating in any way to John, that he was to be sold, took him to Richmond, on the first day of January (the great annual sale day), and directly to the slave-auction. Just as John was being taken into the building, he was invited to submit to hand-cuffs. As the thought flashed upon his mind that he was about to be sold on the auction-block, he grew terribly desperate. &quot;Liberty or death&quot; was the watchword of that awful moment. In the twinkling of an eye, he turned on his enemies, with his fist, knife, and feet, so tiger-like, that he actually put four or five men to flight, his master among the number. His enemies thus suddenly baffled, John wheeled, and, as if assisted by an angel, strange as it may appear, was soon out of sight of his pursuers, and securely hid away. This was the last hour of John Henry&#39;s slave life, but not, however, of his struggles and sufferings for freedom, for before a final chance to escape presented itself, nine months elapsed. The mystery as to where, and how he fared, the following account, in his own words, must explain--</p><pre><code>Nine months I was trying to get away. I was secreted for a long
time in a kitchen of a merchant near the corner of Franklyn and
7th streets, at Richmond, where I was well taken care of, by a
lady friend of my mother. When I got Tired of staying in that
place, I wrote myself a pass to pass myself to Petersburg, here
I stopped with a very prominent Colored person, who was a friend
to Freedom stayed here until two white friends told other
friends if I was in the city to tell me to go at once, and stand
not upon the order of going, because they had hard a plot. I
wrot a pass, started for Richmond, Reached Manchester, got off
the Cars walked into Richmond, once more got back into the same
old Den, Stayed here from the 16th of Aug. to 12th Sept. On the
11th of Sept. 8 o&#39;clock P.M. a message came to me that there had
been a State Room taken on the steamer City of Richmond for my
benefit, and I assured the party that it would be occupied if
God be willing. Before 10 o&#39;clock the next morning, on the 12th,
a beautiful Sept. day, I arose early, wrote my pass for Norfolk
left my old Den with a many a good bye, turned out the back way
to 7th St., thence to Main, down Main behind 4 night waich to
old Rockett&#39;s and after about 20 minutes of delay I succeed in
Reaching the State Room. My Conductor was very much Excited, but
I felt as Composed as I do at this moment, for I had started
from my Den that morning for Liberty or for Death providing
myself with a Brace of Pistels.

Yours truly

J.H. HILL.
</code></pre><p>A private berth was procured for him on the steamship City of Richmond, for the amount of $125, and thus he was brought on safely to Philadelphia. While in the city, he enjoyed the hospitalities of the Vigilance Committee, and the greetings of a number of friends, during the several days of his sojourn. The thought of his wife, and two children, left in Petersburg, however, naturally caused him much anxiety. Fortunately, they were free, therefore, he was not without hope of getting them; moreover, his wife&#39;s father (Jack McCraey), was a free man, well known, and very well to do in the world, and would not be likely to see his daughter and grandchildren suffer. In this particular, Hill&#39;s lot was of a favorable character, compared with that of most slaves leaving their wives and children.</p><p>FIRST LETTER</p><p>ON ARRIVING IN CANADA.</p><pre><code>TORONTO, October 4th, 1853.

DEAR SIR:--I take this method of informing you that I am well,
and that I got to this city all safe and sound, though I did not
get here as soon as I expect. I left your city on Saterday and I
was on the way untel the Friday following. I got to New York the
same day that I left Philadelphia, but I had to stay there untel
Monday evening. I left that place at six o&#39;clock. I got to
Albany next morning in time to take the half past six o&#39;clock
train for Rochester, here I stay untel Wensday night. The reason
I stay there so long Mr. Gibbs given me a letter to Mr Morris at
Rochester. I left that place Wensday, but I only got five miles
from that city that night. I got to Lewiston on Thurday
afternoon, but too late for the boat to this city. I left
Lewiston on Friday at one o&#39;clock, got to this city at five. Sir
I found this to be a very handsome city. I like it better than
any city I ever saw. It are not as large as the city that you
live in, but it is very large place much more so than I expect
to find it. I seen the gentleman that you given me letter to. I
think him much of a gentleman. I got into work on Monday. The
man whom I am working for is name Myers; but I expect to go to
work for another man by name of Tinsly, who is a master workman
in this city. He says that he will give me work next week and
everybody advises me to work for Mr. Tinsly as there more surity
in him.

Mr. Still, I have been looking and looking for my friends for
several days, but have not seen nor heard of them. I hope and
trust in the Lord Almighty that all things are well with them.
My dear sir I could feel so much better sattisfied if I could
hear from my wife. Since I reached this city I have talagraphed
to friend Brown to send my thing to me, but I cannot hear a word

will make them, if we cannot make the old, we will make our
children.

Now concerning the city toronto this city is Beautiful and
Prosperous Levele city. Great many wooden codages more than what
should be but I am in hopes there will be more of the Brick and
Stonn. But I am not done about your Republicanism. Our masters
have told us that there was no living in Canada for a Negro but
if it may Please your gentlemanship to publish these facts that
we are here able to earn our bread and money enough to make us
comftable. But I say give me freedom, and the United States may
have all her money and her Luxtures, yeas give Liberty or Death.
I&#39;m in America, but not under Such a Government that I cannot
express myself, speak, think or write So as I am able, and if my
master had allowed me to have an education I would make them
American Slave-holders feel me, Yeas I would make them tremble

write you something worth reading, but you know we poor
fugitives whom has just come over from the South are not able to
write much on no subject whatever, but I hope by the aid of my
God I will try to use my midnight lamp, untel I can have some
influence upon the American Slavery. If some one would say to
me, that they would give my wife bread untel I could be Educated
I would stoop my trade this day and take up my books.

But a crisis is approaching when assential requisite to the
American Slaveholders when blood Death or Liberty will be
required at their hands. I think our people have depened too
long and too much on false legislator let us now look for
ourselves. It is true that England however the Englishman is our
best friend but we as men ought not to depened upon her
Remonstrace with the Americans because she loves her commercial
trade as any Nations do. But I must say, while we look up and
acknowledge the Power greatness and honor of old England, and
believe that while we sit beneath the Silken folds of her flag
of Perfect Liberty, we are secure, beyond the reach of the
aggressions of the Blood hounds and free from the despotism that
would wrap around our limbs by the damable Slaveholder. Yet we
would not like spoiled childeren depend upon her, but upon
ourselves and as one means of strengthening ourselves, we should
agitate the emigration to Canada. I here send you a paragraph
which I clipted from the weekly Glob. I hope you will publish so
that Mr. Williamson may know that men are not chattel here but
reather they are men and if he wants his chattle let him come
here after it or his thing. I wants you to let the whole United
States know we are satisfied here because I have seen more
Pleasure since I came here then I saw in the U.S. the 24 years
that I served my master. Come Poor distress men women and come
to Canada where colored men are free. Oh how sweet the word do
sound to me yeas when I contemplate of these things, my very
flesh creaps my heart thrub when I think of my beloved friends
whom I left in that cursid hole. Oh my God what can I do for
them or shall I do for them. Lord help them. Suffer them to be
no longer depressed beneath the Bruat Creation but may they be
looked upon as men made of the Bone and Blood as the
Anglo-Americans. May God in his mercy Give Liberty to all this
world. I must close as it am late hour at night. I Remain your

MY DEAR FRIEND:--It is with much pleasure that I take this
opportunity of addressing you with these few lines hoping when
they reeches you they may find yourself and family enjoying good
health as they leaves us at present.

And it is with much happiness that I can say to you that Mrs.
Mercer arrived in this city on yesterday. Mr. Mercer was at my
house late in the evening, and I told him that when he went home
if hear anything from Virginia, that he must let me know as soon
as possible. He told me that if he went home and found any news
there he would come right back and inform me thereof. But little
did he expect to find his dearest there. You may judge what a
meeting there was with them, and may God grant that there may be
some more meetings with our wives and friends. I had been
looking for some one from the old sod for several days, but I
was in good hopes that it would be my poor Uncle. But poor
fellow he are yet groaning under the sufferings of a horrid
sytam, Expecting every day to Receive his Doom. Oh, God, what
shall I do, or what can I do for him? I have prayed for him more
than 12 months, yet he is in that horrid condition. I can never
hear anything Directly from him or any of my people.

Once more I appeal to your Humanity. Will you act for him, as if
you was in slavery yourself, and I sincerely believe that he
will come out of that condition? Mrs. M. have told me that she
given some directions how he could be goten at, but friend
Still, if this conductor should not be successfull this time,
will you mind him of the Poor Slave again. I hope you will as
Mrs. Mercer have told the friend what to do I cannot do more,
therefore I must leve it to the Mercy of God and your Exertion.

The weather have been very mile Ever since the 23rd of Dec. I
have thought considerable about our condition in this country
Seeing that the weather was so very faverable to us. I was
thinking a few days ago, that nature had giving us A country &amp;
adopted all things Sutable.

You will do me the kindness of telling me in your next whether
or not the ten slaves have been Brought out from N.C.

I have not hard from Brown for Nine month he have done some very
Bad letting me alone, for what cause I cannot tell. Give my Best
Respect to Mr. B. when you see him. I wish very much to hear

This decision, however, had only been entertained by him a short time prior to his escape. For a number of years Hezekiah had been laboring under the pleasing thought that he should succeed in obtaining freedom through purchase, having had an understanding with his owner with this object in view. At different times he had paid on account for himself nineteen hundred dollars, six hundred dollars more than he was to have paid according to the first agreement. Although so shamefully defrauded in the first instance, he concluded to bear the disappointment as patiently as possible and get out of the lion&#39;s mouth as best he could.</p><p>He continued to work on and save his money until he had actually come within one hundred dollars of paying two thousand. At this point instead of getting his free papers, as he firmly believed that he should, to his surprise one day he saw a notorious trader approaching the shop where he was at work. The errand of the trader was soon made known. Hezekiah simply requested time to go back to the other end of the shop to get his coat, which he seized and ran. He was pursued but not captured. This occurrence took place in Petersburg, Va., about the first of December, 1854. On the night of the same day of his escape from the trader, Hezekiah walked to Richmond and was there secreted under a floor by a friend. He was a tall man, of powerful muscular strength, about thirty years of age just in the prime of his manhood with enough pluck for two men.</p><p>A heavy reward was offered for him, but the hunters failed to find him in this hiding-place under the floor. He strongly hoped to get away soon; on several occasions he made efforts, but only to be disappointed. At different times at least two captains had consented to afford him a private passage to Philadelphia, but like the impotent man at the pool, some one always got ahead of him. Two or three times he even managed to reach the boat upon the river, but had to return to his horrible place under the floor. Some were under the impression that he was an exceedingly unlucky man, and for a time captains feared to bring him. But his courage sustained him unwaveringly.</p><p>Finally at the expiration of thirteen months, a private passage was procured for him on the steamship Pennsylvania, and with a little slave boy, seven years of age, (the son of the man who had secreted him) though placed in a very hard berth, he came safely to Philadelphia, greatly to the astonishment of the Vigilance Committee, who had waited for him so long that they had despaired of his ever coming.</p><p>The joy that filled Hezekiah&#39;s bosom may be imagined but never described. None but one who had been in similar straits could enter into his feelings.</p><p>He had left his wife Louisa, and two little boys, Henry and Manuel. His passage cost one hundred dollars.</p><p>Hezekiah being a noted character, a number of the true friends were invited to take him by the hand and to rejoice with him over his noble struggles and his triumph; needing rest and recruiting, he was made welcome to stay, at the expense of the committee, as long as he might feel disposed so to do. He remained several days, and then went on to Canada rejoicing. After arriving there he returned his acknowledgment for favors received, &amp;c., in the following letter:</p><pre><code>TORONTO Jan 24th 1856.

While the Committee was looked to for aid in the deliverance of this poor fellow, it was painful to feel that it was not in their power to answer his prayers--not until after his escape, was it possible so to do. But his escape to freedom gave them a satisfaction which no words can well express. At present, John Henry Hill is a justice of the peace in Petersburg. Hezekiah resides at West Point, and James in Boston, rejoicing that all men are free in the United States, at last.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>FROM VIRGINIA, MARYLAND AND DELAWARE.</p><p>ARCHER BARLOW, ALIAS EMIT ROBINS.</p><p>This passenger arrived from Norfolk, Va. in 1853. For the last four years previous to escaping, he had been under the yoke of Dr. George Wilson. Archer declared that he had been &quot;very badly treated&quot; by the Doctor, which he urged as his reason for leaving. True, the doctor had been good enough to allow him to hire his time, for which he required Archer to pay the moderate sum of $120 per annum. As Archer had been &quot;sickly&quot; most of the time, during the last year, he complained that there was &quot;no reduction&quot; in his hire on this account. Upon reflection, therefore, Archer thought, if he had justice done him, he would be in possession of this &quot;one hundred and twenty&quot; himself, and all his other rights, instead of having to toil for another without pay; so he looked seriously into the matter of master and slave, and pretty soon resolved, that if others chose to make no effort to get away, for himself he would never be contented, until he was free. When a slave reached this decision, he was in a very hopeful state. He was near the Underground Rail Road, and was sure to find it, sooner or later. At this thoughtful period, Archer was thirty-one years of age, a man of medium size, and belonged to the two leading branches of southern humanity, <em>i.e.</em>, he <em>was</em> half white and half colored--a dark mulatto. His arrival in Philadelphia, per one of the Richmond steamers, was greeted with joy by the Vigilance Committee, who extended to him the usual aid and care, and forwarded him on to freedom. For a number of years, he has been a citizen of Boston.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>SAMUEL BUSH, ALIAS WILLIAM OBLEBEE.</p><p>This &quot;piece of property&quot; fled in the fall of 1853. As a specimen of this article of commerce, he evinced considerable intelligence. He was a man of dark color, although not totally free from the admixture of the &quot;superior&quot; southern blood in his veins; in stature, he was only ordinary. For leaving, he gave the following reasons: &quot;I found that I was working for my master, for his advantage, and when I was sick, I had to pay just as much as if I were well--$7 a month. But my master was cross, and said that he intended to sell me--to do better by me another year. Times grew worse and worse, constantly. I thought, as I had heard, that if I could raise thirty dollars I could come away.&quot; He at once saw the value of money. To his mind it meant liberty from that moment. Thenceforth he decided to treasure up every dollar he could get hold of until he could accumulate at least enough to get out of &quot;Old Virginia.&quot; He was a married man, and thought he had a wife and one child, but on reflection, he found out that they did not actually belong to him, but to a carpenter, by the name of Bailey. The man whom Samuel was compelled to call master was named Hoyle.</p><p>The Committee&#39;s interview with Samuel was quite satisfactory, and they cheerfully accorded to him brotherly kindness and material aid at the same time.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

They procured employment in the neighborhood of Haddonfield, some six or eight miles from Camden, New Jersey, and were succeeding, as they thought, very well.</p><p>Things went on favorably for about three months, when to their alarm &quot;slave-hunters were discovered in the neighborhood,&quot; and sufficient evidence was obtained to make it quite plain that, John, William and James were the identical persons, for whom the hunters were in &quot;hot pursuit.&quot; When brought to the Committee, they were pretty thoroughly alarmed and felt very anxious to be safely off to Canada. While the Committee always rendered in such cases immediate protection and aid, they nevertheless, felt, in view of the imminent dangers existing under the fugitive slave law, that persons disposed to thus stop by the way, should be very plainly given to understand, that if they were captured they would have themselves the most to blame. But the dread of Slavery was strong in the minds of these fugitives, and they very fully realized their folly in stopping in New Jersey. The Committee procured their tickets, helped them to disguise themselves as much as possible, and admonished them not to stop short of Canada.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>HETTY SCOTT ALIAS MARGARET DUNCANS AND DAUGHTER PRISCILLA.</p><p>This mother and daughter had been the &quot;chattels personal&quot; of Daniel Coolby of Harvard, Md. Their lot had been that of ordinary slaves in the country, on farms, &amp;c. The motive which prompted them to escape was the fact that their master had &quot;threatened to sell&quot; them. He had a right to do so; but Hetty was a little squeamish on this point and took great umbrage at her &quot;kind master.&quot; In this &quot;disobedient&quot; state of mind, she determined, if hard struggling would enable her, to defeat the threats of Mr. Daniel Coolby, that he should not much longer have the satisfaction of enjoying the fruit of the toil of herself and offspring. She at once began to prepare for her journey.</p><p>She had three children of her own to bring, besides she was intimately acquainted with a young man and a young woman, both slaves, to whom she felt that it would be safe to confide her plans with a view of inviting them to accompany her. The young couple were ready converts to the eloquent speech delivered to them by Hetty on Freedom, and were quite willing to accept her as their leader in the emergency. Up to the hour of setting out on their lonely and fatiguing journey, arrangements were being carefully completed, so that there should be no delay of any kind. At the appointed hour they were all moving northward in good order.</p><p>Arriving at Quakertown, Pa., they found friends of the slave, who welcomed them to their homes and sympathy, gladdening the hearts of all concerned. For prudential reasons it was deemed desirable to separate the party, to send some one way and some another. Thus safely, through the kind offices and aid of the friends at Quakertown, they were duly forwarded on to the Committee in Philadelphia. Here similar acts of charity were extended to them, and they were directed on to Canada.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>ROBERT FISHER.</p><p>THIS PASSENGER AVAILS HIMSELF OF HOLIDAY WEEK, BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR&#39;S, TO MAKE HIS NORTHERN TRIP. Robert was about thirty years of age, dark color, quite tall, and in talking with him a little while, it was soon discovered that Slavery had not crushed all the brains out of his head by a good deal. Nor was he so much attached to his &quot;kind-hearted master,&quot; John Edward Jackson, of Anne Arundel, Md., or his old fiddle, that he was contented and happy while in bondage. Far from it. The fact was, that he hated Slavery so decidedly and had such a clear common sense-like view of the evils and misery of the system, that he declared he had as a matter of principle refrained from marrying, in order that he might have no reason to grieve over having added to the woes of slaves. Nor did he wish to be encumbered, if the opportunity offered to escape. According to law he was entitled to his freedom at the age of twenty-five.</p><p>But what right had a negro, which white slave-holders were &quot;bound to respect?&quot; Many who had been willed free, were held just as firmly in Slavery, as if no will had ever been made. Robert had too much sense to suppose that he could gain anything by seeking legal redress. This method, therefore, was considered out of the question. But in the meantime he was growing very naturally in favor of the Underground Rail Road. From his experience Robert did not hesitate to say that his master was &quot;mean,&quot; &quot;a very hard man,&quot; who would work his servants early and late, without allowing them food and clothing sufficient to shield them from the cold and hunger. Robert certainly had unmistakable marks about him, of having been used roughly. He thought very well of Nathan Harris, a fellow-servant belonging to the same owner, and he made up his mind, if Nathan would join him, neither the length of the journey, the loneliness of night travel, the coldness of the weather, the fear of the slave-hunter, nor the scantiness of their means should deter him from making his way to freedom. Nathan listened to the proposal, and was suddenly converted to freedom, and the two united during Christmas week, 1854, and set out on the Underground Rail Road. It is needless to say that they had trying difficulties to encounter. These they expected, but all were overcome, and they reached the Vigilance Committee, in Philadelphia safely, and were cordially welcomed. During the interview, a full interchange of thought resulted, the fugitives were well cared for, and in due time both were forwarded on, free of cost.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

While Hansel did not really own himself, he had the reputation of having a wife and six children. In June, some six months prior to her husband&#39;s arrival, Hansel&#39;s wife had been allowed by her mistress to go out on a begging expedition, to raise money to buy herself; but contrary to the expectation of her mistress she never returned. Doubtless the mistress looked upon this course as a piece of the most highhanded stealing. Hansel did not speak of his owner as being a hard man, but on the contrary he thought that he was about as &quot;good&quot; as the best that he was acquainted with. While this was true, however, Hansel had quite good ground for believing that his master was about to sell him. Dreading this fate he made up his mind to go in pursuit of his wife to a Free state. Exactly where to look or how to find her he could not tell.</p><p>The Committee advised him to &quot;search in Canada.&quot; And in order to enable him to get on quickly and safely, the Committee aided him with money, &amp;c., in 1853.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Her oldest child was a little girl seven years of age, named Lydia; the other was named Louisa Caroline, three years of age, both promising in appearance. They were the so called property of John Ennis, of Georgetown, Delaware. For their flight they chose the dead of Winter. After leaving they made their way to West Chester, and there found friends and security for several weeks, up to the time they reached Philadelphia. Probably the friends with whom they stopped thought the weather too inclement for a woman with children dependent on her support to travel. Long before this mother escaped, thoughts of liberty filled her heart. She was ever watching for an opportunity, that would encourage her to hope for safety, when once the attempt should be made. Until, however, she was convinced that her two children were to be sold, she could not quite muster courage to set out on the journey. This threat to sell proved in multitudes of instances, &quot;the last straw on the camel&#39;s back.&quot; When nothing else would start them this would. Mary and her children were the only slaves owned by this Ennis, consequently her duties were that of &quot;Jack of all trades;&quot; sometimes in the field and sometimes in the barn, as well as in the kitchen, by which, it is needless to say, that her life was rendered servile to the last degree.</p><p>To bind up the broken heart of such a poor slave mother, and to aid such tender plants as were these little girls, from such a wretched state of barbarism as existed in poor little Delaware, was doubly gratifying to the Committee.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

</code></pre><p>These passengers reached the Philadelphia station, about the 24th of September, 1856, five days after they escaped from Carroll county. They were in fine spirits, and had borne the fatigue and privation of travel bravely. A free and interesting interview took place, between these passengers and the Committee, eliciting much information, especially with regard to the workings of the system on the farms, from which they had the good luck to flee. Each of the party was thoroughly questioned, about how time had passed with them at home, or rather in the prison house, what kind of men their masters were, how they fed and clothed, if they whipped, bought or sold, whether they were members of church, or not, and many more questions needless to enumerate bearing on the domestic relation which had existed between themselves and their masters. These queries they answered in their own way, with intelligence. Upon the whole, their lot in Slavery had been rather more favorable than the average run of slaves.</p><p>No record was made of any very severe treatment. In fact, the notices made of them were very brief, and, but for the elaborate way in which they were described in the &quot;Baltimore Sun,&quot; by their owners, their narratives would hardly be considered of sufficient interest to record. The heavy rewards, beautiful descriptions, and elegant illustrations in the &quot;Sun,&quot; were very attractive reading. The Vigilance Committee took the &quot;Sun,&quot; for nothing else under the sun but for this special literature, and for this purpose they always considered the &quot;Sun&quot; a cheap and reliable paper.</p><p>A slave man or woman, running for life, he with a bundle on his back or she with a babe in her arms, was always a very interesting sight, and should always be held in remembrance. Likewise the descriptions given by slave-holders, as a general rule, showed considerable artistic powers and a most thorough knowledge of the physical outlines of this peculiar property. Indeed, the art must have been studied attentively for practical purposes. When the advertisements were received in advance of arrivals, which was always the case, the descriptions generally were found so lifelike, that the Committee preferred to take them in preference to putting themselves to the labor of writing out new ones, for future reference. This we think, ought not to be complained of by any who were so unfortunate as to lose wayward servants, as it is but fair to give credit to all concerned. True, sometimes some of these beautiful advertisements were open to gentle criticism. The one at the head of this report, is clearly of this character. For instance, in describing Isaac, Mr. Thomas B. Owings, represents him as being of a &quot;very light color,&quot; &quot;almost yellow,&quot; &quot;might be called a yellow boy.&quot; In the next breath he has no perceptible marks. Now, if he is &quot;very light,&quot; that is a well-known southern mark, admitted everywhere. A hint to the wise is sufficient. However, judging from what was seen of Isaac in Philadelphia, there was more cunning than &quot;foolishness&quot; about him. Slaves sometimes, when wanting to get away, would make their owners believe that they were very happy and contented. And, in using this kind of foolishness, would keep up appearances until an opportunity offered for an escape. So Isaac might have possessed this sagacity, which appeared like nonsense to his master. That slave-holders, above all others, were in the habit of taking special pains to encourage foolishness, loud laughing, banjo playing, low dancing, etc., in the place of education, virtue, self-respect and manly carriage, slave-holders themselves are witnesses.</p><p>As Mr. Robert Dade was also a loser, equally with Mr. Thomas B. Owings, and as his advertisement was of the same liberality and high tone, it seems but fitting that it should come in just here, to give weight and completeness to the story. Both Owings and Dade showed a considerable degree of southern chivalry in the liberality of their rewards. Doubtless, the large sums thus offered awakened a lively feeling in the breasts of old slave-hunters. But it is to be supposed that the artful fugitives safely reached Philadelphia before the hunters got even the first scent on their track. Up to the present hour, with the owners all may be profound mystery; if so, it is to be hoped, that they may feel some interest in the solution of these wonders. The articles so accurately described must now be permitted to testify in their own words, as taken from the records.</p><p>Green Modock acknowledges that he was owned by William Dorsey, Perry by Robert Dade, Sam and Isaac by Thomas Owings, all farmers, and all &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;pretty mean men.&quot; Sam and Isaac had other names with them, but not such a variety of clothing as their master might have supposed. Sam said he left because his master threatened to sell him to Georgia, and he believed that he meant so to do, as he had sold all his brothers and sisters to Georgia some time before he escaped.</p><p>But this was not all. Sam declared his master had threatened to shoot him a short while before he left. This was the last straw on the camel&#39;s back. Sam&#39;s heart was in Canada ever after that. In traveling he resolved that nothing should stop him. Charles offered the same excuse as did Sam. He had been threatened with the auction-block. He left his mother free, but four sisters he left in chains. As these men spoke of their tough owners and bad treatment in Slavery, they expressed their indignation at the idea that Owings, Dade and Dorsey had dared to rob them of their God-given rights. They were only ignorant farm hands. As they drank in the free air, the thought of their wrongs aroused all their manhood. They were all young men, hale and stout, with strong resolutions to make Canada their future home. The Committee encouraged them in this, and aided them for humanity&#39;s sake.--Mr. Robert Dade&#39;s advertisement speaks for itself as follows:</p><pre><code>RAN AWAY--On Saturday night, 20th inst., from the subscriber,

WHITE, SUSAN BROOKS AND WILLIAM HENRY ATKINS.--STOWED AWAY IN THE STEAMSHIP CITY OF RICHMOND.</p><p>But for their hope of liberty, their uncomfortable position could hardly have been endured by these fugitives. William had been compelled to dig and delve, to earn bread and butter, clothing and luxuries, houses and land, education and ease for H.B. Dickinson, of Richmond. William smarted frequently; but what could he do? Complaint from a slave was a crime of the deepest dye. So William dug away mutely, but continued to think, nevertheless. He was a man of about thirty-six years of age, of dark chestnut color, medium size, and of pleasant manners to say the least. His owner was a tobacco manufacturer, who held some thirty slaves in his own right, besides hiring a great many others. William was regularly employed by day in his master&#39;s tobacco factory. He was likewise employed, as one of the carriers of the Richmond Dispatch; the time allotted to fill the duties of this office, was however, before sunrise in the morning. It is but just to state, in favor of his master, that William was himself the receiver of a part of the pay for this night work. It was by this means William procured clothing and certain other necessaries.</p><p>From William&#39;s report of his master, he was by no means among the worst of slave-holders in Richmond; he did not himself flog, but the overseer was allowed to conduct this business, when it was considered necessary. For a long time William had cherished a strong desire to be free, and had gone so far on several occasions as to make unsuccessful attempts to accomplish this end. At last he was only apprised of his opportunity to carry his wishes into practice a few moments before the hour for the starting of the Underground Rail Road train.</p><p>Being on the watch, he hailed the privilege, and left without looking back.</p><p>True he left his wife and two children, who were free, and a son also who was owned by Warner Toliver, of Gloucester county, Va. We leave the reader to decide for himself, whether William did right or wrong, and who was responsible for the sorrow of both husband and wife caused by the husband&#39;s course. The Committee received him as a true and honest friend of freedom, and as such aided him.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>SUSAN BROOKS.</p><p>Susan was also a passenger on the same ship that brought Wm. B. White. She was from Norfolk. Her toil, body and strength were claimed by Thomas Eckels, Esq., a man of wealth and likewise a man of intemperance. With those who regarded Slavery as a &quot;divine institution,&quot; intemperance was scarcely a mote, in the eyes of such. For sixteen years, Susan had been in the habit of hiring her time, for which she was required to pay five dollars per month. As she had the reputation of being a good cook and chambermaid, she was employed steadily, sometimes on boats. This sum may therefore be considered reasonable.</p><p>Owing to the death of her husband, about a year previous to her escape, she had suffered greatly, so much so, that on two or three occasions, she had fallen into alarming fits,--a fact by no means agreeable to her owner, as he feared that the traders on learning her failing health would underrate her on this account. But Susan was rather thankful for these signs of weakness, as she was thereby enabled to mature her plans and thus to elude detection.</p><p>Her son having gone on ahead to Canada about six months in advance of her, she felt that she had strong ties in the goodly land. Every day she remained in bondage, the cords bound her more tightly, and &quot;weeks seemed like months, and months like years,&quot; so abhorrent had the peculiar institution become to her in every particular. In this state of mind, she saw no other way, than by submitting to be secreted, until an opportunity should offer, via the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>So for four months, like a true and earnest woman, she endured a great &quot;fight of affliction,&quot; in this horrible place. But the thought of freedom enabled her to keep her courage up, until the glad news was conveyed to her that all things were ready, providing that she could get safely to the boat, on which she was to be secreted. How she succeeded in so doing the record book fails to explain.</p><p>One of the methods, which used to succeed very well, in skillful and brave hands, was this: In order to avoid suspicion, the woman intending to be secreted, approached the boat with a clean ironed shirt on her arm, bare headed and in her usual working dress, looking good-natured of course, and as if she were simply conveying the shirt to one of the men on the boat. The attention of the officer on the watch would not for a moment be attracted by a custom so common as this. Thus safely on the boat, the man whose business it was to put this piece of property in the most safe Underground Rail Road place, if he saw that every thing looked favorable, would quickly arrange matters without being missed from his duties. In numerous instances, officers were outwitted in this way.</p><p>As to what Susan had seen in the way of hardships, whether in relation to herself or others, her story was most interesting; but it may here be passed in order to make room for others. She left one sister, named Mary Ann Tharagood, who was wanting to come away very much. Susan was a woman of dark color, round built, medium height, and about forty years of age when she escaped in 1854.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>WILLIAM HENRY ATKINS.</p><p>William Henry was also a fellow-passenger on the same boat with William B. White and Susan Cooke. These might be set down, as first-class Underground Rail Road travelers.</p><p>Henry was a very likely-looking article. He was quite smart, about six feet high, a dark mulatto, and was owned by a Baptist minister.</p><p>For some cause not stated on the books, not long before leaving, Henry had received a notice from his owner, (the Baptist Minister) that he might hunt himself a new master as soon as possible. This was a business that Henry had no relish for. The owner he already had, he concluded bad enough in all conscience, and it did not occur to him that hunting another would mend the matter much. So in thinking over the situation, he was &quot;taken sick.&quot; He felt the need of a little time to reflect upon matters of very weighty moment involving his freedom. So when he was called upon one day to go to his regular toil, the answer was, &quot;I am sick, I am not able to budge hardly.&quot; The excuse took and Henry attended faithfully to his &quot;sick business,&quot; for the time being, while on the other hand, the Baptist Minister waited patiently all the while for William to get well enough for hunting a new master. What had to be done, needed to be done quickly, before his master&#39;s patience was exhausted. William soon had matters arranged for traveling North. He had a wife, Eliza, for whom he felt the greatest affection; but as he viewed matters at that time, he concluded that he could really do more for her in Canada than he could in Norfolk. He saw no chance, either under the Baptist minister, or under a new master. His wife was owned by Susan Langely. When the hour arrived to start, as brave men usually do, Henry, having counted all the cost, was in his place on the boat with his face towards Canada.</p><p>How he looked at matters on John Bull&#39;s side of the house, letters from Henry will abundantly reveal as follows:</p><pre><code>ST.

ST. CATHARINES, C.W., October 5th, 1854.

MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Friend_:--I take the liberty to
address to you a few lines in behalf of my wife, who is still at
Norfolk, Va. I have heard by my friend Richmond Bohm, who
arrived lately, that she was in the hands of my friend Henry
Lovey (the same who had me in hand at the time I started). I
understood that she was about to make her start this month, and
that she was only waiting for me to send her some means. I would
like for you to communicate the substance of this letter to my
wife, through my friend Henry Lovey, and for her to come on as
soon as she can. I would like to have my wife write to me a few
lines by the first opportunity. She could write to you in
Philadelphia, 31 North Fifth street. I wish to send my love to
you &amp; your family &amp; would like for you to answer this letter
with the least possible delay in the care of Hiram Wilson.

Very respectfully yours,

W.H. ATKINS.

P.S. I would like for my friend Henry Lovey to send my wife
right on to Philadelphia; not to stop for want of means, for I
will forward means on to my friend Wm Still. My love to my
father &amp; mother, my friend Lovey &amp; to all my inquiring friends.
If you cannot find it convenient to write, please forward this
by the Boat. H.W.A.

</code></pre><p>FOUR ARRIVALS.</p><p>CHARLOTTE AND HARRIET ESCAPE IN DEEP MOURNING--MASTER IN THE SAME CAR HUNTING FOR THEM, SEES THEM, BUT DOES NOT KNOW THEM--WHITE LADY AND CHILD WITH A COLORED COACHMAN, TRAVELING--AT CHAMBERSBUEG AT A HOTEL, THE PROPRIETOR DETECTS THEM AS U.G.R.R. PASSENGERS--THREE &quot;LIKELY&quot; YOUNG MEN FROM BALTIMORE--&quot;FOUR LARGE AND TWO SMALL HAMS&quot;--POLICE OFFICES IMPARTING INFORMATION AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE--U.G.R.R. PASSENGERS TRAVELING WITH THEIR MASTERS&#39; HORSES AND CARRIAGES--&quot;BREAK DOWN&quot;--CONFLICT WITH WHITE MEN--SIX PASSENGERS RIDING TWO HORSES, &amp;c. About the 31st of May, 1856, an exceedingly anxious state of feeling existed with the active Committee in Philadelphia. In the course of twenty-four hours four arrivals had come to hand from different localities. The circumstances connected with the escape of each party, being so unusual, there was scarcely ground for any other conclusion than that disaster was imminent, if not impossible to be averted.</p><p>It was a day long to be remembered. Aside from the danger, however, a more encouraging hour had never presented itself in the history of the Road. The courage, which had so often been shown in the face of great danger, satisfied the Committee that there were heroes and heroines among these passengers, fully entitled to the applause of the liberty-loving citizens of Brotherly Love. The very idea of having to walk for days and nights in succession, over strange roads, through by-ways, and valleys, over mountains, and marshes, was fitted to appal the bravest hearts, especially where women and children were concerned.</p><p>Being familiar with such cases, the Committee was delighted beyond measure to observe how wisely and successfully each of these parties had managed to overcome these difficulties.</p><p>[Illustration: ]</p><p>Party No. 1 consisted of Charlotte Giles and Harriet Eglin, owned by Capt. Wm. Applegarth and John Delahay. Neither of these girls had any great complaint to make on the score of ill-treatment endured.</p><p>So they contrived each to get a suit of mourning, with heavy black veils, and thus dressed, apparently absorbed with grief, with a friend to pass them to the Baltimore depot (hard place to pass, except aided by an individual well known to the R.R. company), they took a direct course for Philadelphia.</p><p>While seated in the car, before leaving Baltimore (where slaves and masters both belonged), who should enter but the master of one of the girls! In a very excited manner, he hurriedly approached Charlotte and Harriet, who were apparently weeping. Peeping under their veils, &quot;What is your name,&quot; exclaimed the excited gentleman. &quot;Mary, sir,&quot; sobbed Charlotte. &quot;What is your name?&quot; (to the other mourner) &quot;Lizzie, sir,&quot; was the faint reply. On rushed the excited gentleman as if moved by steam--through the cars, looking for his property; not finding it, he passed out of the cars, and to the delight of Charlotte and Harriet soon disappeared. Fair business men would be likely to look at this conduct on the part of the two girls in the light of a &quot;sharp practice.&quot; In military parlance it might be regarded as excellent strategy. Be this as it may, the Underground Rail Road passengers arrived safely at the Philadelphia station and were gladly received.</p><p>A brief stay in the city was thought prudent lest the hunters might be on the pursuit. They were, therefore, retained in safe quarters.</p><p>In the meantime, Arrival No. 2 reached the Committee. It consisted of a colored man, a white woman and a child, ten years old. This case created no little surprise. Not that quite a number of passengers, fair enough to pass for white, with just a slight tinge of colored blood in their veins, even sons and daughters of some of the F.F.V., had not on various occasions come over the U.G.R.R. But this party was peculiar. An explanation was sought, which resulted in ascertaining that the party was from Leesburg, Virginia; that David, the colored man, was about twenty-seven years of age, intelligent, and was owned, or claimed by Joshua Pusey. David had no taste for Slavery, indeed, felt that it would be impossible for him to adapt himself to a life of servitude for the special benefit of others; he had, already, as he thought, been dealt with very wrongfully by Pusey, who had deprived him of many years of the best part of his life, and would continue thus to wrong him, if he did not make a resolute effort to get away. So after thinking of various plans, he determined not to run off as a slave with his &quot;budget on his back,&quot; but to &quot;travel as a coachman,&quot; under the &quot;protection of a white lady.&quot; In planning this pleasant scheme, David was not blind to the fact that neither himself nor the &quot;white lady,&quot; with whom he proposed to travel, possessed either horse or carriage.</p><p>But his master happened to have a vehicle that would answer for the occasion. David reasoned that as Joshua, his so called master, had deprived him of his just dues for so many years, he had a right to borrow, or take without borrowing, one of Joshua&#39;s horses for the expedition. The plan was submitted to the lady, and was approved, and a mutual understanding here entered into, that she should hire a carriage, and take also her little girl with them. The lady was to assume the proprietorship of the horse, carriage and coachman. In so doing all dangers would be, in their judgment, averted. The scheme being all ready for execution, the time for departure was fixed, the carriage hired, David having secured his master Joshua&#39;s horse, and off they started in the direction of Pennsylvania. White people being so accustomed to riding, and colored people to driving, the party looked all right. No one suspected them, that they were aware of, while passing through Virginia.</p><p>[Illustration: ]</p><p>On reaching Chambersburg, Pa., in the evening, they drove to a hotel, the lady alighted, holding by the hand her well dressed and nice-looking little daughter, bearing herself with as independent an air as if she had owned twenty such boys as accompanied her as coachman. She did not hesitate to enter and request accommodations for the night, for herself, daughter, coachman, and horse. Being politely told that they could be accommodated, all that was necessary was, that the lady should show off to the best advantage possible. The same duty also rested with weight upon the mind of David.</p><p>The night passed safely and the morning was ushered in with bright hopes which were overcast but only for a moment, however. Breakfast having been ordered and partaken of, to the lady&#39;s surprise, just as she was in the act of paying the bill, the proprietor of the hotel intimated that he thought that matters &quot;looked a little suspicious,&quot; in other words, he said plainly, that he &quot;believed that it was an Underground Rail Road movement;&quot; but being an obliging hotel-keeper, he assured her at the same time, that he &quot;would not betray them.&quot; Just here it was with them as it would have been on any other rail road when things threaten to come to a stand; they could do nothing more than make their way out of the peril as best they could. One thing they decided to do immediately, namely, to &quot;leave the horse and carriage,&quot; and try other modes of travel. They concluded to take the regular passenger cars. In this way they reached Philadelphia. In Harrisburg, they had sought and received instructions how to find the Committee in Philadelphia.</p><p>What relations had previously existed between David and this lady in Virginia, the Committee knew not. It looked more like the time spoken of in Isaiah, where it is said, &quot;And a little child shall lead them,&quot; than any thing that had ever been previously witnessed on the Underground Rail Road. The Underground Rail Road never practised the proscription governing other roads, on account of race, color, or previous condition. All were welcome to its immunities, white or colored, when the object to be gained favored freedom, or weakened Slavery. As the sole aim apparent in this case was freedom for the slave the Committee received these travellers as Underground Rail Road passengers.</p><p>Arrival No. 3. Charles H. Ringold, Robert Smith, and John Henry Richards, all from Baltimore. Their ages ranged from twenty to twenty-four years. They were in appearance of the class most inviting to men who were in the business of buying and selling slaves. Charles and John were owned by James Hodges, and Robert by Wm. H. Normis, living in Baltimore. This is all that the records contain of them. The exciting and hurrying times when they were in charge of the Committee probably forbade the writing out of a more detailed account of them, as was often the case.</p><p>With the above three arrivals on hand, it may be seen how great was the danger to which all concerned were exposed on account of the bold and open manner in which these parties had escaped from the land of the peculiar institution. Notwithstanding, a feeling of very great gratification existed in view of the success attending the new and adventurous modes of traveling. Indulging in reflections of this sort, the writer on going from his dinner that day to the anti-slavery office, to his surprise found an officer awaiting his coming. Said officer was of the mayor&#39;s police force. Before many moments had been allowed to pass, in which to conjecture his errand, the officer, evidently burdened with the importance of his mission, began to state his business substantially as follows:</p><p>&quot;I have just received a telegraphic despatch from a slave-holder living in Maryland, informing me that six slaves had escaped from him, and that he had reason to believe that they were on their way to Philadelphia, and would come in the regular train direct from Harrisburg; furthermore I am requested to be at the depot on the arrival of the train to arrest the whole party, for whom a reward of $1300 is offered. Now I am not the man for this business. I would have nothing to do with the contemptible work of arresting fugitives. I&#39;d rather help them off. What I am telling you is confidential. My object in coming to the office is simply to notify the Vigilance Committee so that they may be on the look-out for them at the depot this evening and get them out of danger as soon as possible. This is the way I feel about them; but I shall telegraph back that I will be on the look-out.&quot;</p><p>While the officer was giving this information he was listened to most attentively, and every word he uttered was carefully weighed. An air of truthfulness, however, was apparent; nevertheless he was a stranger and there was cause for great cautiousness. During the interview an unopened telegraphic despatch which had come to hand during the writer&#39;s absence, lay on the desk. Impressed with the belief that it might shed light on the officer&#39;s story, the first opportunity that offered, it was seized, opened, and it read as follows: (Copied from the original.)</p><pre><code>HARRISBURG, May 31st, 1856.

WM. STILL, N. 5th St.:--I have sent via at two o&#39;clock four
large and two small hams.

JOS. C. BUSTILL.
</code></pre><p>Here there was no room for further doubt, but much need for vigilance. Although the despatch was not read to the officer, not that his story was doubted, but purely for prudential reasons, he was nevertheless given to understand, that it was about the same party, and that they would be duly looked after. It would hardly have been understood by the officer, had he been permitted to read it so guardedly was it worded, it was indeed dead language to all save the initiated. In one particular especially, relative to the depot where they were expected to arrive, the officer was in the dark, as his despatch pointed to the regular train, and of course to the depot at Eleventh and Market streets. The Underground Rail Road despatch on the contrary pointed to Broad and Callowhill streets &quot;Via,&quot; <em>i.e.</em> Reading.</p><p>As notified, that evening the &quot;four large and two small hams&quot; arrived, and turned out to be of the very finest quality, just such as any trader would have paid the highest market price for. Being mindful of the great danger of the hour, there was felt to be more occasion just then for anxiety and watchfulness, than for cheering and hurrahing over the brave passengers. To provide for them in the usual manner, in view of the threatening aspect of affairs, could not be thought of. In this critical hour it devolved upon a member of the Committee, for the safety of all parties, to find new and separate places of accommodation, especially for the six known to be pursued. To be stored in other than private families would not answer. Three or four such were visited at once; after learning of the danger much sympathy was expressed, but one after another made excuses and refused. This was painful, for the parties had plenty of house room, were identified with the oppressed race, and on public meeting occasions made loud professions of devotion to the cause of the fugitive, &amp;c. The memory of the hour and circumstances is still fresh.</p><p>Accommodations were finally procured for a number of the fugitives with a widow woman, (Ann Laws) whose opportunities for succor were far less than at the places where refusals had been met with. But Mrs. L. was kind-hearted, and nobly manifested a willingness to do all that she could for their safety. Of course the Committee felt bound to bear whatever expense might necessarily be incurred. Here some of the passengers were kept for several days, strictly private, long enough to give the slave-hunters full opportunity to tire themselves, and give up the chase in despair. Some belonging to the former arrivals had also to be similarly kept for the same reasons. Through careful management all were succored and cared for. Whilst much interesting information was obtained from these several arrivals: the incidents connected with their lives in Slavery, and when escaping were but briefly written out. Of this fourth arrival, however, the following intelligence will doubtless be highly gratifying to the friends of freedom, wherever the labors of the Underground Rail Road may be appreciated. The people round about Hagerstown, Maryland, may like to know how these &quot;articles&quot; got off so successfully, the circumstances of their escape having doubtless created some excitement in that region of the country.</p><p>Arrival No. 4. Charles Bird, George Dorsey, Angeline Brown, Albert Brown, Charles Brown and Jane Scott.</p><p>Charles was twenty-four years of age, quite dark, of quick motion, and ready speech, and in every way appearing as though he could take care of himself. He had occupied the condition of a farm laborer. This calling he concluded to forsake, not because he disliked farming, but simply to get rid of David Clargart, who professed to own him, and compelled him to work without pay, &quot;for nothing.&quot; While Charles spoke favorably of Clargart as a man, to the extent, at all events, of testifying that he was not what was called a hard man, nevertheless Charles was so decidedly opposed to Slavery that he felt compelled to look out for himself. Serving another man on the no pay principle, at the same time liable to be flogged, and sold at the pleasure of another, Charles felt was worse than heathenish viewed in any light whatsoever. He was prepared therefore, to leave without delay. He had four sisters in the hands of Clargart, but what could he do for them but leave them to Providence.</p><p>The next on the list was George Dorsey, a comrade of Charles. He was a young man, of medium size, mixed blood, intelligent, and a brave fellow as will appear presently.</p><p>This party in order to get over the road as expeditiously as possible, availed themselves of their master&#39;s horses and wagon and moved off civilly and respectably. About nine miles from home on the road, a couple of white men, finding their carriage broken down approached them, unceremoniously seized the horses by the reins and were evidently about to assume authority, supposing that the boys would surrender at once. But instead of so doing, the boys struck away at them with all their might, with their large clubs, not even waiting to hear what these superior individuals wanted. The effect of the clubs brought them prostrate in the road, in an attitude resembling two men dreaming, (it was in the night.) The victorious passengers, seeing that the smashed up carriage could be of no further use to them, quickly conceived the idea of unhitching and attempting further pursuit on horseback. Each horse was required to carry three passengers. So up they mounted and off they galloped with the horses&#39; heads turned directly towards Pennsylvania. No further difficulty presented itself until after they had traveled some forty miles. Here the poor horses broke down, and had to be abandoned. The fugitives were hopeful, but of the difficulties ahead they wot not; surely no flowery beds of ease awaited them. For one whole week they were obliged to fare as they could, out in the woods, over the mountains, &amp;c. How they overcame the trials in this situation we cannot undertake to describe. Suffice it to say, at the end of the time above mentioned they managed to reach Harrisburg and found assistance as already intimated.</p><p>[Illustration: ]</p><p>George and Angeline, (who was his sister) with her two boys had a considerable amount of white blood in their veins, and belonged to a wealthy man by the name of George Schaeffer, who was in the milling business. They were of one mind in representing him as a hard man. &quot;He would often threaten to sell, and was very hard to please.&quot; George and Angeline left their mother and ten brothers and sisters.</p><p>Jane was a well-grown girl, smart, and not bad-looking, with a fine brown skin, and was also owned by Schaeffer.</p><p>Letters from the enterprising Charlotte and Harriet (arrival No. 1), brought the gratifying intelligence, that they had found good homes in Western New York, and valued their freedom highly. Three out of quite a number of letters received from them from time to time are subjoined.</p><pre><code>SENNETT, June, 1856.

MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_:--I am happy to tell you that
Charlotte Gildes and myself have got along thus far safely. We
have had no trouble and found friends all the way along, for
which we feel very thankful to you and to all our friends on the
road since we left. We reached Mr. Loguen&#39;s in Syracuse, on last
Tuesday evening &amp; on Wednesday two gentlemen from this community
called and we went with them to work in their families. What I
wish you would do is to be so kind as to send our clothes to
this place if they should fall into your hands. We hope our
uncle in Baltimore will get the letter Charlotte wrote to him
last Sabbath, while we were at your house, concerning the
clothes. Perhaps the best would be to send them to Syracuse to
the _care of Mr. Loguen_ and he will send them to us. This will
more certainly ensure our getting them. If you hear anything
that would be interesting to Charlotte or me from Baltimore,
please direct a letter to us to this place, to the care of Revd.
Chas. Anderson, Sennett, Cayuga Co., N.Y. Please give my love
and Charlotte&#39;s to Mrs. Still and thank her for her kindness to
us while at your house.

</code></pre><p>SECOND LETTER.</p><pre><code>SENNETT, July 31st, 1856.

MR. WM. STILL:--_My Dear Friend_:--I have just received your
note of 29th inst. and allow me dear sir, to assure you that the
only letter I have written, is the one you received, an answer
to which you sent me. I never wrote to Baltimore, nor did any
person write for me there, and it is with _indescribable grief_,
that I hear what your letter communicates to me, of those who
you say have gotten into difficulty on my account. My Cousin
Charlotte who came with me, got into a good place in this
vicinity, but she could not content herself to stay here but
just _one week_--she then went to Canada--and she is the one who
by writing (if any one), has brought this trouble upon those to
whom you refer in Baltimore.

She has written me two letters from Canada, and by neither of
them can I ascertain _where she lives_--her letters are mailed
at Suspension Bridge, but she does not live there as her letters
show. In the first she does not even sign her name. She has
evidently employed some person to write, who is nearly as
ignorant as herself. If I knew where to find her I would find
out _what_ she has written.

I don&#39;t know but she has told where I live, and may yet get me
and my friends here, in trouble too, as she has some in other
places. I don&#39;t wish to have you trouble yourself about my
clothes, I am in a place where I can get all the clothes I want
or need. Will you please write me when convenient and tell me
what you hear about those who I fear are suffering as the result
of their kindness to me? May God, in some way, grant them
deliverance. Oh the misery, the sorrow, which this cursed system
of Slavery is constantly bringing upon millions in this land of
boasted freedom!

Can you tell me where Sarah King is, who was at your house when
I was there? She was going to Canada to meet her husband. Give
my love to Mrs. Still &amp; accept the same yourself. Your much
indebted &amp; obliged friend,

HARRIET EGLIN.
</code></pre><p>The &quot;difficulty&quot; about which Harriet expressed so much regret in the above letter, had reference to a letter supposed to have been written by her friend Charlotte to Baltimore, about her clothing. It had been intercepted, and in this way, a clue was obtained by one of the owners as to how they escaped, who aided them, etc. On the strength of the information thus obtained, a well-known colored man, named Adams, was straightway arrested and put in prison at the instance of one of the owners, and also a suit was at the same time instituted against the Rail Road Company for damages--by which steps quite a huge excitement was created in Baltimore. As to the colored man Adams, the prospect looked simply hopeless. Many hearts were sad in view of the doom which they feared would fall upon him for obeying a humane impulse (he had put the girls on the cars). But with the Rail Road Company it was a different matter; they had money, power, friends, etc., and could defy the courts. In the course of a few months, when the suit against Adams and the Rail Road Company came up, the Rail Road Company proved in court, in defense, that the prosecutor entered the cars in search of his runaway, and went and spoke to the two young women in &quot;mourning&quot; the day they escaped, looking expressly for the identical parties, for which he was seeking damages before the court, and that he declared to the conductor, on leaving the cars, that the said &quot;two girls in mourning, were not the ones he was looking after,&quot; or in other words, that &quot;neither&quot; belonged to him. This positive testimony satisfied the jury, and the Rail Road Company and poor James Adams escaped by the verdict not guilty. The owner of the lost property had the costs to pay of course, but whether he was made a wiser or better man by the operation was never ascertained.</p><p>THIRD LETTER.</p><pre><code>SENNETT, October 28th, 1856.

DEAR MR. STILL:--I am happy to tell you that I am well and
happy. I still live with Rev. Mr. Anderson in this place, I am
learning to read and write. I do not like to trouble you too
much, but I would like to know if you have heard anything more
about my friends in Baltimore who got into trouble on our
account. Do be pleased to write me if you can give me any
information about them. I feel bad that they should suffer for
me. I wish all my brethren and sisters in bondage, were as well
off as I am. The girl that came with me is in Canada, near the
Suspension Bridge. I was glad to see Green Murdock, a colored
young man, who stopped at your house about six weeks ago, he
knew my folks at the South. He has got into a good place to work
in this neighborhood. Give my love to Mrs Still, and believe me
your obliged friend,

P.S. I would like to know what became of Johnson,[A] the man
whose foot was smashed by jumping off the cars, he was at your
house when I was there.

while escaping, beheld his master or pursuer in the cars, and
jumped therefrom, crushing his feet shockingly by the bold act.]

In order to keep this volume within due limits, in the cases to be noticed in this chapter, it will be impossible to state more than a few of the interesting particulars that make up these narratives. While some of these passengers might not have been made in the prison house to drink of the bitter cup as often as others, and in their flight might not have been called upon to pass through as severe perils as fell to the lot of others, nevertheless justice seems to require, that, as far as possible, all the passengers passing over the Philadelphia Underground Rail Road shall be noticed.</p><p>James Burrell. James was certainly justifiable in making his escape, if for no other reason than on the score of being nearly related to the chivalry of the South. He was a mulatto (the son of a white man evidently), about thirty-two years of age, medium size, and of an agreeable appearance. He was owned by a maiden lady, who lived at Williamsburg, but not requiring his services in her own family, she hired him out by the year to a Mr. John Walker, a manufacturer of tobacco, for which she received $120 annually. This arrangement was not satisfactory to James. He could not see why he should be compelled to wear the yoke like an ox. The more he thought over his condition, the more unhappy was his lot, until at last he concluded, that he could not stand Slavery any longer. He had witnessed a great deal of the hardships of the system of Slavery, and he had quite enough intelligence to portray the horrors thereof in very vivid colors. It was the auction-block horror that first prompted him to seek freedom. While thinking how he would manage to get away safely, his wife and children were ever present in his mind. He felt as a husband should towards his &quot;wife Betsy,&quot; and likewise loved his &quot;children, Walter and Mary;&quot; but these belonged to another man, who lived some distance in the country, where he had permission to see them only once a week. This had its pleasure, it also had its painful influence. The weekly partings were a never-failing source of unhappiness. So when James&#39; mind was fully made up to escape from Slavery, he decided that it would not be best to break the secret to his poor wife and children, but to get off to Canada, and afterwards to try and see what he could do for their deliverance. The hour fixed to leave Virginia arrived, and he started and succeeded in reaching Philadelphia, and the Committee. On arriving he needed medicine, clothing, food, and a carriage for his accommodation, all which were furnished freely by the Committee, and he was duly forwarded to Canada. From Canada, with his name changed, he wrote as follows:</p><pre><code>TORONTO, March 28th, 1854.

</code></pre><p>DANIEL WIGGINS, <em>alias</em> DANIEL ROBINSON. Daniel fled from Norfolk, Va., where he had been owned by the late Richard Scott. Only a few days before Daniel escaped, his so-called owner was summoned to his last account. While ill, just before the close of his career, he often promised D. his freedom and also promised, if restored, that he would make amends for the past, by changing his ways of living. His son, who was very reckless, he would frequently allude to and declared, &quot;that he,&quot; the son, &quot;should not have his &#39;property.&#39;&quot; These dying sentiments filled Daniel with great hopes that the day of his enslavement was nearly at an end. Unfortunately, however, death visited the old master, ere he had made provision for his slaves. At all events, no will was found. That he might not fall a prey to the reckless son, he felt, that he must nerve himself for a desperate struggle to obtain his freedom in some other way, by traveling on the Underground Rail Road. While he had always been debarred from book learning, he was, nevertheless, a man of some intelligence, and by trade was a practical Corker.</p><p>He was called upon in this trying hour to leave his wife with three children, but they were, fortunately, free. Coming to the Committee in want, they cheerfully aided him, and forwarded him on to Canada. Thence, immediately on his arrival, he returned the following grateful letter:</p><pre><code>NEW BEDFORD, Mass., March 22d, 1854.

DEAR SIR:--I am happy to inform you that I arrived in this place
this morning well and cheerful. I am, sir, to you and others
under more obligations for your kindly protection of me than I
can in any way express at present. May the Lord preserve you
unto eternal life. Remember my respects to Mr. Lundy and family.
Should the boat lay up please let me know.

Yours respectfully,

DAVID ROBINSON.

Please forward to Dr. H. Lundy, after you have gotten through.
With respects, &amp;c.

</code></pre><p>WM. ROBINSON, <em>alias</em> THOS. HARRED. William gave satisfactory evidence, at first sight, that he was opposed to the unrequited labor system <em>in toto</em>, and even hated still more the flogging practices of the chivalry. Although he had reached his twenty-eighth year, and was a truly fair specimen of his race, considering his opportunities, a few days before William left, the overseer on the plantation attempted to flog him, but did not succeed. William&#39;s manhood was aroused, and he flogged the overseer soundly, if what he averred was true. The name of William&#39;s owner was John G. Beale, Esq., of Fauquier county, Va. Beale was considered to be a man of wealth, and had invested in Slave stock to the number of seventy head. According to William&#39;s account of Beale, he was a &quot;hard man and thought no more of his black people than he did of dogs.&quot; When William entered upon the undertaking of freeing himself from Beale&#39;s barbarism, he had but one dollar and twenty-five cents in his possession; but he had physical strength and a determined mind, and being heartily sick of Slavery, he was willing to make the trial, even at the cost of life. Thus hopeful, he prosecuted his journey with success through strange regions of country, with but little aid or encouragement before reaching Philadelphia. This feat, however, was not performed without getting lost by the way. On arriving, his shoes were gone, and his feet were severely travel-worn. The Committee rendered needed aid, etc., and sent William on to Canada to work for himself, and to be recognized as a subject of Great Britain.</p><p>EDWARD PEADEN AND WIFE HARRIET, AND SISTER CELIA. This man and his wife and wife&#39;s sister were a nice-looking trio, but they brought quite a sad story with them: the sale of their children, six in number. The auction block had made such sad havoc among them, that no room was left to hope, that their situation would ever be improved by remaining. Indeed they had been under a very gloomy cloud for some time previous to leaving, fearing that the auction block was shortly to be their doom. To escape this fate, they were constrained to &quot;secrete themselves for one month,&quot; until an opportunity offered them to secure a passage on a boat coming to Philadelphia. Edward (the husband), was about forty-four years of age, of a dark color, well made, full face, pleasant countenance, and talked fluently. Dr. Price claimed him as his personal property, and exacted all his hire and labor. For twelve years he had been hired out for $100 per annum. Harriet, the wife of Edward, belonged to David Baines, of Norfolk. Her general appearance indicated, that nature had favored her physically and mentally, although being subjected to the drudgery of Slave life, with no advantages for development, she was simply a living testimony to the crushing influence of Slavery--with a heart never free from the saddened recollection of the auction block, on which all of her children had been sacrificed, &quot;one by one.&quot; Celia, the sister, also belonged to D. Baines, and was kept hired out--was last in the service of the Mayor of Norfolk. Of her story nothing of any moment was recorded. On their arrival in Philadelphia, as usual they were handed over to the Committee, and their wants were met.</p><p>WILLIAM DAVIS. All that the records contain of William is as follows: He left Emmitsburg, Md., the previous Friday night, where he had been held by Dr. James Shoul. William is thirty-two years of age, dark color, rather below medium stature. With regard to his slave life, he declared that he had been &quot;roughly used.&quot; Besides, for some time before escaping, he felt that his owner was in the &quot;notion of trading&quot; him off. The fear that this apprehended notion would be carried into execution, was what prompted him to leave his master.</p><p>ALEXANDER BOGGS, alias JOHNSON HENSON. This subject was under the ownership of a certain John Ernie, who lived about three miles from Baltimore. Mr. Ernie had only been in possession of the wayward Alexander three weeks, having purchased him of a trader named Dennit, for $550. This was not the first time, however, that he had experienced the trouble of changing masters, in consequence of having been sold. Previously to his being disposed of by the trader Dennit, he had been owned by Senator Merrick, who had the misfortune to fail in business, in consequence whereof, his slaves had all to be sold and Alexander with the rest, away from his wife, Caroline, and two children, James and Eliezer.</p><p>This was a case that appealed for sympathy and aid, which were cheerfully rendered by the Committee. Alexander was about fifty years of age, of dark color. On the Records no account of cruel treatment is found, other than being sold, &amp;c.</p><p>JOHN BROWN, alias JACOB WILLIAMS, arrived from Fredericktown, Md., where he had been working under the yoke of Joseph Postly. John was a young man of twenty-nine years of age. Up to the hour of his escape, his lot had been that of an ordinary slave. Indeed, he had much less to complain of with reference to usage than most slaves; the only thing in this respect the records contain, is simply a charge, that his master threatened to sell him. But this did not seem to have been the motive which prompted John to take leave of his master. Although untutored, he had mind enough to comprehend that Postly had no right to oppress him, and wrong him out of his hire. John concluded that he would not stand such treatment any longer, and made up his mind to leave for Canada. After due examination the Committee, finding his story reasonable, gave him the usual assistance, advice and instruction, and sent him on Canada-ward.</p><p>SAMUEL SLATER, alias PATTERSON SMITH, came from a place called Power Bridge, Md. He gave a satisfactory account of himself, and was commended for having wisely left his master, William Martin, to earn his bread by the sweat of his own brow. Martin had held up the vision of the auction-block before Sam; this was enough. Sam saw that it was time for him to be getting out of danger&#39;s way without delay, so he presumed, if others could manage to escape, he could too. And he succeeded. He was a stout man, about twenty-nine years of age, of dark complexion. No particular mention of ill treatment is found on the Records.</p><p>After arriving in Canada, his heart turned with deep interest and affection to those left in the prison-house, as the following letter indicates.</p><pre><code>ST. CATHRINES Oct 29th.

</code></pre><p>HARRISON BELL AND DAUGHTER HARRIET ANN. Father and daughter were fortunate enough to escape together from Norfolk, Va.</p><p>Harrison was just in the prime of life, forty years of age, stout made, good features, but in height was rather below medium, was a man of more than ordinary shrewdness, by trade he was a chandler. He alleged that he had been used hard.</p><p>Harriet Ann was a well-grown girl of pleasant appearance, fourteen years of age. Father and daughter had each different owners, one belonged to James Snyder, the other to John G. Hodgson.</p><p>Harrison had been informed that his children were to be sold; to prevent this shocking fate, he was prompted to escape. Several months previous to finding a chance to make a safe flight, he secreted himself with his children in Norfolk, and so remained up to the day he left, a passage having been secured for them on one of the boats coming to Philadelphia. While the records contain no definite account of other children, it is evident that there were others, but what became of them is not known.</p><p>If at the time of their arrival, it had been imagined that the glorious day of universal freedom was only about eight years off, doubtless much fuller records would have been made of these struggling Underground Rail Road passengers. If Harrison&#39;s relatives and friends, who suddenly missed him and his daughter Harriet Ann, in the Spring of 1854, are still ignorant of his whereabouts, this very brief account of their arrival in Philadelphia, may be of some satisfaction to all concerned, not excepting his old master, whom he had served so faithfully.</p><p>The Committee finding them in need, had the pleasure of furnishing them with food, material aid and a carriage, with cheering words and letters of introduction to friends on the road to Canada.</p><p>DANIEL DAVIS, ALIAS DAVID SMITH, ADAM NICHOLSON, ALIAS JOHN WYNKOOP, REUBEN BOWLES, ALIAS CUNNIGAN, ARRIVED FROM HEDGEVILLE, VA.</p><p>Daniel was only about twenty, just at a capital age to make a bold strike for freedom. The appearance and air of this young aspirant for liberty indicated that he was not of the material to be held in chains. He was a man of medium size, well-built, dark color, and intelligent. Hon. Charles J. Fortner, M.C. was the reputed owner of this young fugitive, but the honorable gentleman having no use for his services, or because he may have profited more by hiring him out, Daniel was placed in the employ of a farmer, by the name of Adam Quigley. It was at this time he resolved that he would not be a slave any longer. He declared that Quigley was a &quot;very mean man,&quot; one for whom he had no respect whatever. Indeed he felt that the system of Slavery was an abomination in any form it might be viewed. While he was yet so young, he had pretty clear views with regard to Slavery, and remembered with feelings of deep indignation, how his father had been sold when he himself was a boy, just as a horse might have been sold; and how his mother was dragging her chains in Slavery, up to the hour he fled. Thus in company with his two companions he was prepared for any sacrifice.</p><p>Adam&#39;S tale is soon told; all that is on the old record in addition to his full name, is in the following words: &quot;Adam is dark, rugged and sensible, and was owned by Alexander Hill, a drunkard, gambler, &amp;c.&quot;</p><p>Reuben had been hired out to John Sabbard near Hedgeville. Startled at hearing that he was to be sold, he was led to consider the propriety of seeking flight via the Underground Rail Road. These three young men were all fine specimens of farm hands, and possessed more than average common sense, considering the oppression they had to labor under. They walked the entire distance from Hedgeville, Va., to Greenville, Pa. There they took the cars and walked no more. They appeared travel-worn, garments dirty, and forlorn; but the Committee had them cleanly washed, hair cut and shaved, change of clothing furnished, &amp;c., which at once made them look like very different men. Means were appropriated to send them on free of cost.</p><p>JAMES STEWART, <em>alias</em> WM. JACKSON. James had been made acquainted with the Peculiar Institution in Fauquier county, Va. Being of sound judgment and firm resolution, he became an enemy to Slavery at a very early age; so much so, that by the time he was twenty-one he was willing to put into practice his views of the system by leaving it and going where all men are free. Very different indeed were these notions, from those held by his owner, Wm. Rose, who believed in Slavery for the black man. So as James could neither enjoy his freedom nor express his opinion in Virginia, he determined, that he had better get a passage on the Underground Rail Road, and leave the land of Slavery and the obnoxious sentiments of his master. He, of course, saw formidable difficulties to be encountered all the way along in escaping, but these, he considered, would be more easy for him to overcome than it would be for him to learn the lesson--&quot;Servants, obey your masters.&quot; The very idea made James sick. This, therefore, was the secret of his escape.</p><p>HARRIET HALEY, <em>alias</em> ANN RICHARDSON, AND ELIZABETH HALEY, <em>alias</em> SARAH RICHARDSON. These travelers succeeded in escaping from Geo. C. Davis, of Harford county, Md. In order to carry out their plans, they took advantage of Whitsuntide, a holiday, and with marked ingenuity and perseverance, they managed to escape and reach Quakertown Underground Rail Road Station without obstruction, where protection and assistance were rendered by the friends of the cause. After abiding there for a short time, they were forwarded to the Committee in Philadelphia. Their ages ranged from nineteen to twenty-one, and they were apparently &quot;servants&quot; of a very superior order. The pleasure it afforded to aid such young women in escaping from a condition so loathsome as that of Slavery in Maryland, was unalloyed.</p><p>BENJAMIN DUNCANS, <em>alias</em> GEORGE SCOTT. This individual was in bonds under Thomas Jeffries, who was a firm believer in the doctrine: &quot;Servants, obey your masters,&quot; and, furthermore, while laboring &quot;pretty hard&quot; to make Benjamin a convert to this idea, he had made Benjamin&#39;s lot anything else than smooth. This treatment on the part of the master made a wise and resolute man of the Slave. For as he looked earnestly into the fact, that he was only regarded by his owner in the light of an ox, or an ass, his manhood rebelled straightway, and the true light of freedom told him, that he must be willing to labor, and endure suffering for the great prize, liberty. So, in company with five others, at an appointed time, he set out for freedom, and succeeded. The others, alluded to, passed on to Canada direct. Benjamin was induced to stop a few months in Pennsylvania, during which time he occupied himself in farming. He looked as if he was well able to do a full day&#39;s work at this occupation. He was about twenty-five years of age, of unmixed blood, and wore a pleasant countenance.</p><p>MOSES WINES. Portsmouth, Va., lost one of her most substantial laborers in the person of Moses, and Madam Abigail Wheeler, a very &quot;likely article&quot; of merchandise. &quot;No complaint&quot; as to &quot;ill treatment&quot; was made by Moses against &quot;Miss Abigail.&quot; The truth was, he admitted, that he had been used in a &quot;mild way.&quot; With some degree of pride, he stated that he &quot;had never been flogged.&quot; But, for the &quot;last fifteen years, he had been favored with the exalted privilege of &#39;hiring&#39; his time at the &#39;reasonable&#39; sum of $12 per month.&quot; As he stood pledged to have this amount always ready, &quot;whether sick or well,&quot; at the end of the month, his mistress &quot;never neglected to be in readiness to receive it&quot; to the last cent. In this way Moses was taught to be exceedingly punctual. Who would not commend such a mistress for the punctuality, if nothing more? But as smoothly as matters seemed to be going along, the mischievous idea crept into Moses&#39; head, that he ought to have some of the money claimed by his &quot;kind&quot; mistress, and at the same time, the thought would often forcibly press upon his mind that he might any day be sold. In addition to this unpleasant prospect, Virginia had just about that time passed a law &quot;prohibiting Slaves from hiring their time&quot;--also, a number of &quot;new Police rules with reference to Slaves and free colored people,&quot; all of which, the &quot;humane Slave-holders&quot; of that &quot;liberal State,&quot; regarded as highly essential both for the &quot;protection and safety of Master and Slave.&quot; But the stupid-headed Moses was not pleased with these arrangements. In common with many of the Slaves, he smarted severely under his heavy oppression, and felt that it was similar to an old rule, which had been once tried under Pharaoh--namely, when the children of Israel were required to &quot;make bricks without straw.&quot; But Moses was not a fit subject to submit to be ruled so inhumanly.</p><p>Despite the beautiful sermons he had often listened to in favor of Slavery, and the many wise laws, above alluded to, he could not reconcile himself to his condition. The laws and preaching were alike as &quot;sounding brass, and tinkling cymbals&quot; to him. He made up his mind, therefore, that he must try a free country; that his manhood required him to make the effort at once, even at the risk of life. Father and husband, as he was, and loving his wife, Grace, and son, Alphonso, tenderly as he did, he nevertheless felt himself to be in chains, and that he could do but little for them by remaining. He conceived that, if he could succeed in gaining his freedom, he might possibly aid them away also. With this hope in him, he contrived to secure a private passage on the steamship City of Richmond, and in this way reached Philadelphia, but not without suffering fearfully the entire journey through, owing to the narrowness of the space into which he was obliged to be stowed in order to get away.</p><p>Moses was a man of medium size, quite dark, and gave promise of being capable of taking care of himself in freedom. He had seen much of the cruelties of Slavery inflicted upon others in various forms, which he related in a way to make one shudder; but these incidents were not recorded in the book at the time.</p><p>SARAH SMITH, alias MILDRETH PAGE, and her daughter, nine years of age. Sarah and her child were held to service by the Rev. A.D. Pollock, a resident of Wilmington, Del. Until about nine months before she escaped from the Reverend gentleman, she was owned by Mrs. Elizabeth Lee of Fauquier Co., Va., who had moved with Sarah to Wilmington. How Mr. Pollock came by Sarah is not stated on the records; perhaps by marriage; be that as it may, it was owing to ill treatment from her mistress that Sarah &quot;took out&quot; with her child. Sarah was a woman of becoming manners, of a dark brown complexion, and looked as though she might do a fair share of housework, if treated well. As it required no great effort to escape from Wilmington, where the watchful Garrett lived, she reached the Committee in Philadelphia without much difficulty, received assistance and was sent on her way rejoicing.</p><p>LUCY GARRETT, alias JULIA WOOD. John Williams, who was said to be a &quot;very cruel man,&quot; residing on the Western Shore of Va., claimed Lucy as his chattel personal. Julia, having a lively sense of his meanness stood much in fear of being sold; having seen her father, three sisters, and two brothers, disposed of at auction, she was daily on the look-out for her turn to come next. The good spirit of freedom made the way plain to her by which an escape could be effected. Being about nineteen years of age, she felt that she had served in Slavery long enough. She resolved to start immediately, and did so, and succeeded in reaching Pennsylvania. Her appearance recommended her so well, that she was prevailed upon to remain and accept a situation in the family of Joseph A. Dugdale, so well known in reformatory circles, as an ardent friend of humanity. While in his family she gave great satisfaction, and was much esteemed for uprightness and industry. But this place was not Canada, so, when it was deemed best, she was sent on.</p><p>ELLEN FORMAN, alias ELIZABETH YOUNG. Ellen had formerly been owned by Dr. Thomas, of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, but about one year before escaping, she was bought by a lady living in Baltimore known by the name of Mrs. Johnson. Ellen was about thirty years of age, of slender stature, and of a dark brown complexion. The record makes no mention of cruel treatment or very hard usage, as a slave. From traveling, probably, she had contracted a very heavy cold, which threatened her with consumption. The Committee cheerfully rendered her assistance.</p><p>WILLIAM WOODEN, alias WILLIAM NELSON. While Delaware was not far from freedom, and while Slavery was considered to exist there comparatively in a mild form, nevertheless, what with the impenetrable ignorance in which it was the wont of pro-slavery whites to keep the slaves, and the unwillingness on the part of slave-holders generally to conform to the spirit of progress going on in the adjacent State of Pennsylvania, it was wonderful how the slaves saw through the thick darkness thus prevailing, and how wide-awake they were to escape.</p><p>It was from this State, that William Wooden fled. True, William was said to belong to Judge Wooden, of Georgetown, Del., but, according to the story of his &quot;chattel,&quot; the Judge was not of the class who judged righteously. He had not only treated William badly, but he had threatened to sell him. This was the bitter pill which constrained William to &quot;take out.&quot; The threat seemed hard at first, but its effect was excellent for this young man; it was the cause of his obtaining his freedom at the age of twenty-three. William was a tall, well-built man, of dark complexion and promising. No further particulars concerning him are on the records.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD HANDY, <em>alias</em> DANIEL CANON. At Seaford, Delaware, James was held in bonds under a Slave-holder called Samuel Lewis, who followed farming. Lewis was not satisfied with working James hard and keeping all his earnings, but would insolently talk occasionally of handing him &quot;over to the trader.&quot; This &quot;stirred James&#39; blood&quot; and aroused his courage to the &quot;sticking point.&quot; Nothing could induce him to remain. He had the name of having a wife and four children, but according to the Laws of Delaware, he only had a nominal right in them. They were &quot;legally the property of Capt. Martin.&quot; Therefore they were all left in the hands of Capt. Martin. The wife&#39;s name was Harriet Delaney, <em>alias</em> Smart Stanley. James Henry Delaney came as a fellow-traveler with James Edward. He had experienced oppression under Capt. Martin, and as a witness, was prepared to testify, that Martin &quot;ill-treated his Slaves, especially with regard to the diet, which was very poor.&quot; Nevertheless James was a stout, heavy-built young man of twenty-six years of age, and looked as if he might have a great deal of valuable work in him. He was a single man.</p><p>JAMES HENRY BLACKSON. James Henry had only reached twenty-five, when he came to the &quot;conclusion, that he had served long enough under bondage for the benefit of Charles Wright.&quot; This was about all of the excuse he seemed to have for escaping. He was a fine specimen of a man, so far as physical strength and muscular power were concerned. Very little was recorded of him.</p><p>GEORGE FREELAND. It was only by the most indomitable resolution and perseverance, that Freeland threw off the yoke. Capt. John Pollard of Petersburg, Va., held George to service. As a Slave-holder, Pollard belonged to that class, who did not believe in granting favors to Slaves. On the contrary, he was practically in favor of wringing every drop of blood from their bodies.</p><p>George was a spare-built man, about twenty-five years of age, quite dark, but had considerable intelligence. He could read and write very well, but how he acquired these arts is not known. In testifying against his master, George used very strong language. He declared that Pollard &quot;thought no more of his servants than if they had been dogs. He was very mean. He gave nothing to his servants. He has given me only one pair of shoes the last ten years.&quot; After careful inquiry, George learned that he could get a private passage on the City of Richmond, if he could raise the passage money. This he could do cheerfully. He raised &quot;sixty dollars&quot; for the individual who was to &quot;secrete him on the boat.&quot; In leaving the land of Slave auctions, whips and chains, he was obliged to leave his mother and father and two brothers in Petersburg. Pollard had been offered $1,500 for George. Doubtless he found, when he discovered George had gone, that he had &quot;overstood the market.&quot; This was what produced action prompt and decisive on the part of George. So the old adage, in this case, was verified--&quot;It&#39;s an ill wind that blows nobody any good.&quot;</p><p>On arriving in Canada, George did not forget to express gratitude to those who aided him on his road there, as the following note will show:</p><pre><code>SINCATHANS, canada west.

</code></pre><p>MILES WHITE. This passenger owed service to Albert Kern, of Elizabeth City, N.C. At least Kern, through the oppressive laws of that State, claimed Miles as his personal property. Miles, however, thought differently, but he was not at liberty to argue the case with Kern; for on the &quot;side of the oppressor there was strength.&quot; So he resolved, that he would adopt the Underground Rail Road plan. As he was only about twenty-one years of age, he found it much easier to close his affairs with North Carolina, than it would have been had he been encumbered with a family. In fact, the only serious difficulty he had to surmount was to find a captain with whom he could secure a safe passage North. To his gratification it was not long before his efforts in this direction were crowned with success. A vessel was being loaded with shingles, the captain of which was kind enough to allow Miles to occupy a very secure hiding-place thereon. In course of time, having suffered to the extent usual when so closely conveyed, he arrived in Philadelphia, and being aided, was duly forwarded by the Committee.</p><p>JOHN HALL, <em>alias</em> JOHN SIMPSON. John fled from South Carolina. In this hot-bed of Slavery he labored and suffered up to the age of thirty-two. For a length of time before he escaped, his burdens were intolerable; but he could see no way to rid himself of them, except by flight. Nor was he by any means certain that an effort in this direction would prove successful. In planning the route which he should take to travel North he decided, that if success was for him, his best chance would be to wend his way through North Carolina and Virginia. Not that he hoped to find friends or helpers in these States. He had heard enough of the cruelties of Slavery in these regions to convince him, that if he should be caught, there would be no sympathy or mercy shown. Nevertheless the irons were piercing him so severely, that he felt constrained to try his luck, let the consequences be what they might, and so he set out for freedom or death. Mountains of difficulties, and months of suffering and privations by land and water, in the woods, and swamps of North Carolina and Virginia, were before him, as his experience in traveling proved. But the hope of final victory and his daily sufferings before he started, kept him from faltering, even when starvation and death seemed to be staring him in the face. For several months he was living in dens and caves of the earth.</p><p>Ultimately, however, the morning of his ardent hopes dawned. How he succeeded in finding a captain who was kind enough to afford him a secret hiding-place on his boat, was not noted on the records. Indeed the incidents of his story were but briefly written out. Similar cases of thrilling interest seemed almost incredible, and the Committee were constrained to doubt the story altogether until other testimony could be obtained to verify the statement. In this instance, before the Committee were fully satisfied, they felt it necessary to make inquiry of trustworthy Charlestonians to ascertain if John were really from Charleston, and if he were actually owned by the man that he represented as having owned him, Dr. Philip Mazyck, by name; and furthermore, to learn if the master was really of the brutal character given him. The testimony of thoroughly reliable persons, who were acquainted with master and slave, so far as this man&#39;s bondage in Charleston was concerned, fully corroborated his statement, and the Committee could not but credit his story; indeed they were convinced, that he had been one of the greatest of sufferers and the chief of heroes. Nevertheless his story was not written out, and can only be hinted at. Perhaps more time was consumed in its investigation and in listening to a recital of his sufferings than could well be spared; perhaps it was thought, as was often the case, unless full justice could be given him, the story would be spoiled; or perhaps the appalling nature of his sufferings rendered the pen powerless, and made the heart too sick for the task. Whether it was so or not in this case, it was not unfrequently so in other instances, as is well remembered. It will be necessary, in the subsequent pages of this work, to omit the narratives of a great many who, unfortunately, were but briefly noted on the books at the time of their arrival. In the eyes of some, this may prove disappointing, especially in instances where these pages are turned to with the hope of gaining a clue to certain lost ones. As all, however, cannot be mentioned, and as the general reader will look for incidents and facts which will most fittingly bring out the chief characteristics in the career and escape of bondmen, the reasonableness of this course must be obvious to all.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>CHARLES GILBERT.</p><p>FLEEING FROM DAVIS A NEGRO TRADER, SECRETED UNDER A HOTEL, UP A TREE, UNDER A FLOOR, IN A THICKET, ON A STEAMER. In 1854 Charles was owned in the city of Richmond by Benjamin Davis, a notorious negro trader. Charles was quite a &quot;likely-looking article,&quot; not too black or too white, but rather of a nice &quot;ginger-bread color.&quot; Davis was of opinion that this &quot;article&quot; must bring him a tip-top price. For two or three months the trader advertised Charles for sale in the papers, but for some reason or other Charles did not command the high price demanded.</p><p>While Davis was thus daily trying to sell Charles, Charles was contemplating how he might escape. Being uncommonly shrewd he learned something about a captain of a schooner from Boston, and determined to approach him with regard to securing a passage. The captain manifested a disposition to accommodate him for the sum of ten dollars, provided Charles could manage to get to Old Point Comfort, there to embark. The Point was about one hundred and sixty miles distant from Richmond.</p><p>A man of ordinary nerve would have declined this condition unhesitatingly. On the other hand it was not Charles&#39; intention to let any offer slide; indeed he felt that he must make an effort, if he failed. He could not see how his lot could be made more miserable by attempting to flee. In full view of all the consequences he ventured to take the hazardous step, and to his great satisfaction he reached Old Point Comfort safely. In that locality he was well known, unfortunately too well known, for he had been raised partly there, and, at the same time, many of his relatives and acquaintances were still living there. These facts were evidently well known to the trader, who unquestionably had snares set in order to entrap Charles should he seek shelter among his relatives, a reasonable supposition. Charles had scarcely reached his old home before he was apprised of the fact that the hunters and watch dogs of Slavery were eagerly watching for him. Even his nearest relatives, through fear of consequences had to hide their faces as it were from him. None dare offer him a night&#39;s lodging, scarcely a cup of water, lest such an act might be discovered by the hunters, whose fiendish hearts would have found pleasure in meting out the most dire punishments to those guilty of thus violating the laws of Slavery. The prospect, if not utterly hopeless, was decidedly discouraging. The way to Boston was entirely closed. A &quot;reward of $200&quot; was advertised for his capture. For the first week after arriving at Old Point he entrusted himself to a young friend by the name of E.S. The fear of the pursuers drove him from his hiding-place at the expiration of the week. Thence he sought shelter neither with kinfolks, Christians, nor infidels, but in this hour of his calamity he made up his mind that he would try living under a large hotel for a while. Having watched his opportunity, he managed to reach Higee hotel, a very large house without a cellar, erected on pillars three or four feet above the ground. One place alone, near the cistern, presented some chance for a hiding-place, sufficient to satisfy him quite well under the circumstances. This dark and gloomy spot he at once willingly occupied rather than return to Slavery. In this refuge he remained four weeks. Of course he could not live without food; but to communicate with man or woman would inevitably subject him to danger. Charles&#39; experience in the neighborhood of his old home left no ground for him to hope that he would be likely to find friendly aid anywhere under the shadow of Slavery. In consequence of these fears he received his food from the &quot;slop tub,&quot; securing this diet in the darkness of night after all was still and quiet around the hotel. To use his own language, the meals thus obtained were often &quot;sweet&quot; to his taste.</p><p>One evening, however, he was not a little alarmed by the approach of an Irish boy who came under the hotel to hunt chickens. While prowling around in the darkness he appeared to be making his way unconsciously to the very spot where Charles was reposing. How to meet the danger was to Charles&#39; mind at first very puzzling, there was no time now to plan. As quick as thought he feigned the bark of a savage dog accompanied with a furious growl and snarl which he was confident would frighten the boy half out of his senses, and cause him to depart quickly from his private apartment. The trick succeeded admirably, and the emergency was satisfactorily met, so far as the boy was concerned, but the boy&#39;s father hearing the attack of the dog, swore that he would kill him. Charles was a silent listener to the threat, and he saw that he could no longer remain in safety in his present quarter. So that night he took his departure for Bay Shore; here he decided to pass a day in the woods, but the privacy of this place was not altogether satisfactory to Charles&#39; mind; but where to find a more secure retreat he could not,--dared not venture to ascertain that day. It occurred to him, however, that he would be much safer up a tree than hid in the bushes and undergrowth. He therefore climbed up a large acorn tree and there passed an entire day in deep meditation. No gleam of hope appeared, yet he would not suffer himself to think of returning to bondage. In this dilemma he remembered a poor washer-woman named Isabella, a slave who had charge of a wash-house. With her he resolved to seek succor. Leaving the woods he proceeded to the wash-house and was kindly received by Isabella, but what to do with him or how to afford him any protection she could see no way whatever. The schooling which Charles had been receiving a number of weeks in connection with the most fearful looking-for of the threatened wrath of the trader made it much easier for him than for her to see how he could be provided for. A room and comforts he was not accustomed to. Of course he could not expect such comforts now. Like many another escaping from the relentless tyrant, Charles could contrive methods which to his venturesome mind would afford hope, however desperate they might appear to others. He thought that he might be safe under the floor. To Isabella the idea was new, but her sympathies were strongly with Charles, and she readily consented to accommodate him under the floor of the wash-house. Isabella and a friend of Charles, by the name of John Thomas, were the only persons who were cognizant of this arrangement. The kindness of these friends, manifested by their willingness to do anything in their power to add to the comfort of Charles, was proof to him that his efforts and sufferings had not been altogether in vain. He remained under the floor two weeks, accessible to kind voices and friendly ministrations. At the end of this time his repose was again sorely disturbed by reports from without that suspicion had been awakened towards the wash-house. How this happened neither Charles nor his friends could conjecture. But the arrival of six officers whom he could hear talking very plainly in the house, whose errand was actually to search for him, convinced him that he had never for a single moment been in greater danger. The officers not only searched the house, but they offered his friend John Thomas $25 if he would only put them on Charles&#39; track. John professed to know nothing; Isabella was equally ignorant. Discouraged with their efforts on this occasion, the officers gave up the hunt and left the house. Charles, however, had had enough of the floor accommodations. He left that night and returned to his old quarters under the hotel. Here he stayed one week, at the expiration of which time the need of fresh air was so imperative, that he resolved to go out at night to Allen&#39;s cottage and spend a day in the woods. He had knowledge of a place where the undergrowth and bushes were almost impenetrable. To rest and refresh himself in this thicket he felt would be a great comfort to him. Without serious difficulty he reached the thicket, and while pondering over the all-absorbing matter as to how he should ever manage to make his escape, an old man approached. Now while Charles had no reason to think that he was sought by the old intruder, his very near approach admonished him that it would neither be safe nor agreeable to allow him to come nearer. Charles remembering that his trick of playing the dog, when previously in danger under the hotel, had served a good end, thought that it would work well in the thicket. So he again tried his power at growling and barking hideously for a moment or two, which at once caused the man to turn his course. Charles could hear him distinctly retreating, and at the same time cursing the dog. The owner of the place had the reputation of keeping &quot;bad dogs,&quot; so the old man poured out a dreadful threat against &quot;Stephens&#39; dogs,&quot; and was soon out of the reach of the one in the thicket.</p><p>[Illustration: ]</p><p>Notwithstanding his success in frightening off the old man, CHARLES felt that the thicket was by no means a safe place for him. He concluded to make another change. This time he sought a marsh; two hours&#39; stay there was sufficient to satisfy him, that that too was no place to tarry in, even for a single night. He, therefore, left immediately. A third time, he returned to the hotel, where he remained only two days. His appeals had at last reached the heart of his mother--she could no longer bear to see him struggling, and suffering, and not render him aid, whatever the consequences might be. If she at first feared to lend him a helping hand, she now resolutely worked with a view of saving money to succor him. Here the prospect began to brighten.</p><p>A passage was secured for him on a steamer bound for Philadelphia. One more day, and night must elapse, ere he could be received on board. The joyful anticipations which now filled his breast left no room for fear; indeed, he could scarcely contain himself; he was drunk with joy. In this state of mind he concluded that nothing would afford him more pleasure before leaving, than to spend his last hours at the wash house, &quot;under the floor.&quot; To this place he went with no fear of hunters before his eyes. Charles had scarcely been three hours in this place, however, before three officers came in search of him. Two of them talked with Isabella, asked her about her &quot;boarders,&quot; etc.; in the meanwhile, one of them uninvited, made his way up stairs. It so happened, that Charles was in this very portion of the house. His case now seemed more hopeless than ever. The officer up stairs was separated from him simply by a thin curtain. Women&#39;s garments hung all around. Instead of fainting or surrendering, in the twinkling of an eye, Charles&#39; inventive intellect, led him to enrobe himself in female attire. Here, to use his own language, a &quot;thousand thoughts&quot; rushed into his mind in a minute. The next instant he was going down stairs in the presence of the officers, his old calico dress, bonnet and rig, attracting no further attention than simply to elicit the following simple questions: &quot;Whose gal are you?&quot; &quot;Mr. Cockling&#39;s, sir.&quot; &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Delie, sir.&quot; &quot;Go on then!&quot; said one of the officers, and on Charles went to avail himself of the passage on the steamer which his mother had procured for him for the sum of thirty dollars.</p><p>In due time, he succeeded in getting on the steamer, but he soon learned, that her course was not direct to Philadelphia, but that some stay would be made in Norfolk, Va. Although disappointed, yet this being a step in the right direction, he made up his mind to be patient. He was delayed in Norfolk four weeks. From the time Charles first escaped, his owner (Davis the negro trader), had kept a standing reward of $550 advertised for his recovery. This showed that Davis was willing to risk heavy expenses for Charles as well as gave evidence that he believed him still secreted either about Richmond, Petersburg, or Old Point Comfort. In this belief he was not far from being correct, for Charles spent most of his time in either of these three places, from the day of his escape until the day that he finally embarked. At last, the long looked-for hour arrived to start for Philadelphia.</p><p>He was to leave his mother, with no hope of ever seeing her again, but she had purchased herself and was called free. Her name was Margaret Johnson. Three brothers likewise were ever in his thoughts, (in chains), &quot;Henry,&quot; &quot;Bill,&quot; and &quot;Sam,&quot; (half brothers). But after all the hope of freedom outweighed every other consideration, and he was prepared to give up all for liberty. To die rather than remain a slave was his resolve.</p><p>Charles arrived per steamer, from Norfolk, on the 11th day of November, 1854. The Richmond papers bear witness to the fact, that Benjamin Davis advertised Charles Gilbert, for mouths prior to this date, as has been stated in this narrative. As to the correctness of the story, all that the writer has to say is, that he took it down from the lips of Charles, hurriedly, directly after his arrival, with no thought of magnifying a single incident. On the contrary, much that was of interest in the story had to be omitted. Instead of being overdrawn, not half of the particulars were recorded. Had the idea then been entertained, that the narrative of this young slave-warrior was to be brought to light in the manner and time that it now is, a far more thrilling account of his adventures might have been written. Other colored men who knew both Davis and Charles, as well as one man ordinarily knows another, rejoiced at seeing Charles in Philadelphia, and they listened with perfect faith to his story. So marvellous were the incidents of his escape, that his sufferings in Slavery, previous to his heroic struggles to throw off the yoke, were among the facts omitted from the records. While this may be regretted it is, nevertheless, gratifying on the whole to have so good an account of him as was preserved. It is needless to say, that the Committee took especial pleasure in aiding him, and listening to so remarkable a story narrated so intelligently by one who had been a slave.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>LIBERTY OR DEATH.</p><p>JIM BOW-LEGS, <em>alias</em> BILL PAUL.</p><p>In 1855 a traveler arrived with the above name, who, on examination, was found to possess very extraordinary characteristics. As a hero and adventurer some passages of his history were most remarkable. His schooling had been such as could only be gathered on plantations under brutal overseers;--or while fleeing,--or in swamps,--in prisons,--or on the auction-block, etc.; in which condition he was often found. Nevertheless in these circumstances his mind got well stored with vigorous thoughts--neither books nor friendly advisers being at his command. Yet his native intelligence as it regarded human nature, was extraordinary. His resolution and perseverance never faltered. In all respects he was a remarkable man. He was a young man, weighing about one hundred and eighty pounds, of uncommon muscular strength. He was born in the State of Georgia, Oglethorpe county, and was owned by Dr. Thomas Stephens, of Lexington. On reaching the Vigilance Committee in Philadelphia, his story was told many times over to one and another. Hour after hour was occupied by friends in listening to the simple narrative of his struggles for freedom. A very full account of &quot;Jim,&quot; was forwarded in a letter to M.A. Shadd, the then Editress of the &quot;Provincial Freeman.&quot; Said account has been carefully preserved, and is here annexed as it appeared in the columns of the above named paper:</p><pre><code>&quot;I must now pass to a third adventurer. The one to whom I
allude, is a young man of twenty-six years of age, by the name
of &#39;Jim,&#39; who fled from near Charleston, S.C. Taking all the
facts and circumstances into consideration respecting the
courageous career of this successful adventurer for freedom, his
case is by far more interesting than any I have yet referred to.
Indeed, for the good of the cause, and the honor of one who
gained his liberty by periling his life so frequently:--shot
several times,--making six unsuccessful attempts to escape from
the far South,--numberless times chased by
bloodhounds,--captured, imprisoned and sold repeatedly,--living
for months in the woods, swamps and caves, subsisting mainly on
parched corn and berries, &amp;c., &amp;c., his narrative ought, by all
means, to be published, though I doubt very much whether many
could be found who could persuade themselves to believe
one-tenth part of this marvellous story.

Though this poor Fugitive was utterly ignorant of letters, his
natural good sense and keen perception qualified him to arrest
the attention and interest the heart in a most remarkable
degree.

His master finding him not available, on account of his
absconding propensities, would gladly have offered him for sale.
He was once taken to Florida, for that purpose; but, generally,
traders being wide awake, on inspecting him, would almost
invariably pronounce him a &#39;d----n rascal,&#39; because he would
never fail to eye them sternly, as they inspected him. The
obedient and submissive slave is always recognized by hanging
his head and looking on the ground, when looked at by a
slave-holder. This lesson Jim had never learned, hence he was
not to be trusted.

His head and chest, and indeed his entire structure, as solid as
a rock, indicated that he was physically no ordinary man; and
not being under the influence of the spirit of &quot;non-resistance,&quot;
he had occasionally been found to be a rather formidable
customer.

His father was a full-blooded Indian, brother to the noted
Indian Chief, Billy Bowlegs; his mother was quite black and of
unmixed blood.

For five or six years, the greater part of Jim&#39;s time was
occupied in trying to escape, and in being in prison for sale,
to punish him for running away.

His mechanical genius was excellent, so were his geographical
abilities. He could make shoes or do carpenter&#39;s work very
handily, though he had never had the chance to learn. As to
traveling by night or day, he was always road-ready and having
an uncommon memory, could give exceedingly good accounts of what
he saw, etc.

When he entered a swamp, and had occasion to take a nap he took
care first to decide upon the posture he must take, so that if
come upon unexpectedly by the hounds and slave-hunters, he might
know in an instant which way to steer to defeat them. He always
carried a liquid, which he had prepared, to prevent hounds from
scenting him, which he said had never failed. As soon as the
hounds came to the place where he had rubbed his legs and feet
with said liquid, they could follow him no further, but howled
and turned immediately.

Quite a large number of the friends of the slave saw this
noble-hearted fugitive, and would sit long and listen with the
most undivided attention to his narrative--none doubting for a
moment, I think, the entire truthfulness of his story. Strange
as his story was, there was so much natural simplicity in his
manner and countenance, one could not refrain from believing
him.&quot;

</code></pre><p>SALT-WATER FUGITIVE.</p><p>This was an exceptional case, as this passenger did not reach the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia, yet to exclude him on this account, would be doing an injustice to history.</p><p>The facts in his case were incontestably established in the Philadelphia Register in April, 1854, from which the following thrilling account is taken:</p><pre><code>The steamship, Keystone State, which arrived at this port on
Saturday morning, had just entered Delaware Bay, when a man was
discovered secreted outside of the vessel and under the guards.
When brought from his hiding-place, he was found to be a
Fugitive Slave, who had secreted himself there before the vessel
left Savannah on Wednesday, and had remained in that place from
the time of starting!

His position was such, that the water swept over and around him
almost constantly. He had some bread in his pocket, which he had
intended for subsistence until he could reach a land of liberty.
It was saturated with sea-water and dissolved to a pulp.

When our readers remember the high winds of Friday, and the
sudden change to cold during that night, and the fact that the
fugitive had remained in that situation for three days and
nights, we think it will be conceded that he fully earned his
liberty, and that the &quot;institution,&quot; which was so intolerable
that he was willing to run the risk of almost certain death to
escape from it had no very great attractions for him. But the
poor man was doomed to disappointment. The captain ordered the
vessel to put into Newcastle, where, the fugitive, hardly able
to stand, was taken on shore and incarcerated, and where he now
awaits the order of his owner in Savannah. The following
additional particulars are from the same paper of the 21st.





The Keystone State case.--Our article yesterday morning brought
us several letters of inquiry and offers of contributions to aid
in the purchase from his master of the unfortunate inmate of
Newcastle jail. In answer to the former, we would say, that the
steamer Keystone State, left Savannah, at 9 A.M., last
Wednesday. It was about the same hour next morning that the men
engaged in heaving lead, heard a voice from under the guards
imploring help. A rope was procured, and the man relieved from
his dangerous and suffering situation. He was well cared for
immediately; a suit of dry clothes was furnished him, and he was
given his share of the contents of the boat pantry. On arriving
at Newcastle, the captain had him placed in jail, for the
purpose, as we are informed, of taking him back to Savannah.

To those who have offered contributions so liberally, we answer,
that the prospect is, that only a small amount will be
needed--enough to fee a lawyer to sue out a writ of habeas
corpus. The salt water fugitive claims to be a free man, and a
native of Philadelphia. He gives his name as Edward Davis, and
says that he formerly lived at No. 5 Steel&#39;s court, that he was
a pupil in Bird&#39;s school, on Sixth St. above Lombard, and that
he has a sister living at Mr. Diamond&#39;s, a distiller, on South
St. We are not informed why he was in Georgia, from which he
took such an extraordinary means to effect his escape. If the
above assertion be true, we apprehend little trouble in
restoring the man to his former home. The claim of the captain
to take him back to Savannah, will not be listened to for a
moment by any court. The only claim the owners of the &quot;Keystone
State&quot; or the captain can have on salt water Davis, is for half
passenger fare; he came half the way as a fish. A gentleman who
came from Wilmington yesterday, assures us that the case is in
good hands at Newcastle.
</code></pre><p>FULL PARTICULARS OF THE ABDUCTION, ENSLAVING AND ESCAPE OF DAVIS. ATTEMPT TO SEDUCE HIM TO SLAVERY AGAIN.</p><pre><code>The case of the colored man Davis, who made such a bold stroke
to regain his liberty, by periling his life on board the steamer
Keystone State, has excited very general attention. He has given
a detailed account of his abduction and sale as a slave in the
State of Maryland and Georgia, and some of his adventures up to
the time of reaching Delaware. His own story is substantially as
follows:

He left Philadelphia on the 15th of September, 1851, and went to
Harrisburg, intending to go to Hollidaysburg; took a canal boat
for Havre de Grace, where he arrived next day. There he hired on
board the schooner Thomas and Edward (oyster boat), of
Baltimore. Went from Havre de Grace to St. Michael&#39;s, for
oysters, thence to Baltimore, and thence to Havre de Grace
again.

He then hired to a Mr. Sullivan, who kept a grocery store, to do
jobs. While there, a constable, named Smith, took him before a
magistrate named Graham, who fined him fifteen or twenty dollars
for violating the law in relation to free negroes coming into
the State. This fine he was not able to pay, and Smith took him
to Bell Air prison. Sheriff Gaw wrote to Mr. Maitland in
Philadelphia, to whom he referred, and received an answer that
Mr. Maitland was dead and none of the family knew him. He
remained in that prison nearly two months. He then had a trial
in court before a Judge Grier (most unfortunate name), who
sentenced him to be sold to pay his fine and expenses, amounting
to fifty dollars.

After a few days and _without being offered at public sale_, he
was taken out of jail at two o&#39;clock in the morning and carried
to Campbell&#39;s slave pen, in Baltimore, where he remained several
months. While there, he was employed to cook for some fifty or
sixty slaves, being told that he was working out his fine and
jail fees. After being there about six months, he was taken out
of prison, handcuffed by one Winters, who took him and two or
three others to Washington and thence to Charleston, S.C. Here
Winters left them, and they were taken by steamboat to Savannah.
While on board the boat, he learned that himself and the other
two had been sold to Mr. William Dean, of Macon, where he stayed
two days, and was taken from that place to the East Valley
Railroad.

Subsequently he was sent to work on the Possum Tail Railroad.
Here he was worked so hard, that in one month he lost his
health. The other two men taken on with him, failed before he
did. He was then sent to Macon, and thence to the cotton
plantation again.

During the time he worked on the railroad he had allowed him for
food, one peck of corn meal, four pounds of bacon, and one quart
of molasses per week. He cooked it himself at night, for the
next day&#39;s use. He worked at packing cotton for four or five
months, and in the middle of November, 1852, was sent back to
the railroad, where he was again set to wheeling.

He worked at &quot;task work&quot; two months, being obliged to wheel
_sixteen_ square yards per day. At the end of two months he
broke down again, and was sick. They tried one month to cure
him, but did not succeed. In July, 1853, he was taken to an
infirmary in Macon. Dr. Nottinghan and Dr. Harris, of that
institution, both stated that his was the worst case of the kind
they ever had. He remained at the infirmary two months and
partially recovered. He told the story of his wrongs to these
physicians, who tried to buy him. One of his legs was drawn up
so that he could not walk well, and they offered four hundred
dollars for him, which his master refused. The doctors wanted
him to attend their patients, (mostly slaves). While in Georgia
he was frequently asked where he came from, being found more
intelligent than the common run of slaves.

On the 12th of March he ran away from Macon and went to
Savannah. There he hid in a stable until Tuesday afternoon at
six o&#39;clock, when he secreted himself on board the Keystone
State. At 9 o&#39;clock the next morning the Keystone State left
with Davis secreted, as we have before stated. With his
imprisonment in Newcastle, after being pronounced free, our
readers are already familiar. We subjoin the documents on which
he was discharged from his imprisonment in Newcastle, and his
subsequent re-committal on the oath of Capt. Hardie.

The Marshal has returned to Georgia, and will probably bring the claimant on the next trip of the Keystone State. The authorities of Delaware manifest no disposition to deliver up a man whose freedom has been so clearly proved; but every effort will be made to reduce him again to slavery by the man who claims him, in which, it seems, he has the hearty co-operation of Capt. Hardie. A trial will be had before U.S. Commissioner Guthrie, and we have every reason to suppose it will be a fair one. The friends of right and justice should remember that such a trial will be attended with considerable expense, and that the imprisoned man has been too long deprived of his liberty to have money to pay for his own defence.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>SAMUEL GREEN ALIAS WESLEY KINNARD, AUGUST 28th, 1854.</p><p>TEN YEARS IN THE PENITENTIARY FOR HAVING A COPY OF UNCLE TOM&#39;S CABIN.</p><p>The passenger answering to the above name, left Indian Creek, Chester Co., Md., where he had been held to service or labor, by Dr. James Muse. One week had elapsed from the time he set out until his arrival in Philadelphia. Although he had never enjoyed school privileges of any kind, yet he was not devoid of intelligence. He had profited by his daily experience as a slave, and withal, had managed to learn to read and write a little, despite law and usage to the contrary. Sam was about twenty-five years of age and by trade, a blacksmith. Before running away, his general character for sobriety, industry, and religion, had evidently been considered good, but in coveting his freedom and running away to obtain it, he had sunk far below the utmost limit of forgiveness or mercy in the estimation of the slave-holders of Indian Creek.</p><p>During his intercourse with the Vigilance Committee, while rejoicing over his triumphant flight, he gave, with no appearance of excitement, but calmly, and in a common-sense like manner, a brief description of his master, which was entered on the record book substantially as follows: &quot;Dr. James Muse is thought by the servants to be the worst man in Maryland, inflicting whipping and all manner of cruelties upon the servants.&quot;</p><p>While Sam gave reasons for this sweeping charge, which left no room for doubt, on the part of the Committee, of his sincerity and good judgment, it was not deemed necessary to make a note of more of the doctor&#39;s character than seemed actually needed, in order to show why &quot;Sam&quot; had taken passage on the Underground Rail Road. For several years, &quot;Sam&quot; was hired out by the doctor at blacksmithing; in this situation, daily wearing the yoke of unrequited labor, through the kindness of Harriet Tubman (sometimes called &quot;Moses&quot;), the light of the Underground Rail Road and Canada suddenly illuminated his mind. It was new to him, but he was quite too intelligent and liberty-loving, not to heed the valuable information which this sister of humanity imparted. Thenceforth he was in love with Canada, and likewise a decided admirer of the U.R. Road. Harriet was herself, a shrewd and fearless agent, and well understood the entire route from that part of the country to Canada. The spring previous, she had paid a visit to the very neighborhood in which &quot;Sam&quot; lived, expressly to lead her own brothers out of &quot;Egypt.&quot; She succeeded. To &quot;Sam&quot; this was cheering and glorious news, and he made up his mind, that before a great while, Indian Creek should have one less slave and that Canada should have one more citizen. Faithfully did he watch an opportunity to carry out his resolution. In due time a good Providence opened the way, and to &quot;Sam&#39;s&quot; satisfaction he reached Philadelphia, having encountered no peculiar difficulties. The Committee, perceiving that he was smart, active, and promising, encouraged his undertaking, and having given him friendly advice, aided him in the usual manner. Letters of introduction were given him, and he was duly forwarded on his way. He had left his father, mother, and one sister behind. Samuel and Catharine were the names of his parents. Thus far, his escape would seem not to affect his parents, nor was it apparent that there was any other cause why the owner should revenge himself upon them.</p><p>The father was an old local preacher in the Methodist Church--much esteemed as an inoffensive, industrious man; earning his bread by the sweat of his brow, and contriving to move along in the narrow road allotted colored people bond or free, without exciting a spirit of ill will in the pro-slavery power of his community. But the rancor awakened in the breast of slave-holders in consequence of the high-handed step the son had taken, brought the father under suspicion and hate. Under the circumstances, the eye of Slavery could do nothing more than watch for an occasion to pounce upon him. It was not long before the desired opportunity presented itself. Moved by parental affection, the old man concluded to pay a visit to his boy, to see how he was faring in a distant land, and among strangers. This resolution he quietly carried into effect. He found his son in Canada, doing well; industrious; a man of sobriety, and following his father&#39;s footsteps religiously. That the old man&#39;s heart was delighted with what his eyes saw and his ears heard in Canada, none can doubt. But in the simplicity of his imagination, he never dreamed that this visit was to be made the means of his destruction. During the best portion of his days he had faithfully worn the badge of Slavery, had afterwards purchased his freedom, and thus become a free man. He innocently conceived the idea that he was doing no harm in availing himself not only of his God-given rights, but of the rights that he had also purchased by the hard toil of his own hands. But the enemy was lurking in ambush for him--thirsting for his blood. To his utter consternation, not long after his return from his visit to his son &quot;a party of gentlemen from the New Market district, went at night to Green&#39;s house and made search, whereupon was found a copy of Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin, etc.&quot; This was enough--the hour had come, wherein to wreak vengeance upon poor Green. The course pursued and the result, may be seen in the following statement taken from the Cambridge (Md.), &quot;Democrat,&quot; of April 29th, 1857, and communicated by the writer to the &quot;Provincial Freeman.&quot;</p><pre><code>SAM GREEN.

The case of the State against Sam Green (free negro) indicted
for having in his possession, papers, pamphlets and pictorial
representations, having a tendency to create discontent, etc.,
among the people of color in the State, was tried before the
court on Friday last.

This case was of the utmost importance, and has created in the
public mind a great deal of interest--it being the first case of
the kind ever having occurred in our country.

It appeared, in evidence, that this Green has a son in Canada,
to whom Green made a visit last summer. Since his return to this
county, suspicion has fastened upon him, as giving aid and
assisting slaves who have since absconded and reached Canada,
and several weeks ago, a party of gentlemen from New Market
district, went at night, to Green&#39;s house and made search,
whereupon was found a volume of &quot;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin,&quot; a map of
Canada, several schedules of routes to the North, and a letter
from his son in Canada, detailing the pleasant trip he had, the
number of friends he met with on the way, with plenty to eat,
drink, etc., and concludes with a request to his father, that he
shall tell certain other slaves, naming them, to come on, which
slaves, it is well known, did leave shortly afterwards, and have
reached Canada. The case was argued with great ability, the
counsel on both sides displaying a great deal of ingenuity,
learning and eloquence. The first indictment was for the having
in possession the letter, map and route schedules.

Notwithstanding the mass of evidence given, to show the
prisoner&#39;s guilt, in unlawfully having in his possession these
documents, and the nine-tenths of the community in which he
lived, believed that he had a hand in the running away of
slaves, it was the opinion of the court, that the law under
which he was indicted, was not applicable to the case, and that
he must, accordingly, render a verdict of not guilty.

He was immediately arraigned upon another indictment, for having
in possession &quot;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin,&quot; and tried; in this case the
court has not yet rendered a verdict, but holds it under _curia_
till after the Somerset county court. It is to be hoped, the
court will find the evidence in this case sufficient to bring it
within the scope of the law under which the prisoner is indicted
(that of 1842, chap. 272), and that the prisoner may meet his
due reward--be that what it may.

That there is something required to be done by our Legislators,
for the protection of slave property, is evident from the
variety of constructions put upon the statute in this case, and
we trust, that at the next meeting of the Legislature there will
be such amendments, as to make the law on this subject,
perfectly clear and comprehensible to the understanding of every
one.

In the language of the assistant counsel for the State, &quot;Slavery
must be protected or it must be abolished.&quot;

SAMUEL GREEN.
</code></pre><p>In this dark hour the friends of the Slave could do but little more than sympathize with this heart-stricken son and grey-headed father. The aged follower of the Rejected and Crucified had like Him to bear the &quot;reproach of many,&quot; and make his bed with the wicked in the Penitentiary. Doubtless there were a few friends in his neighborhood who sympathized with him, but they were powerless to aid the old man. But thanks to a kind Providence, the great deliverance brought about during the Rebellion by which so many captives were freed, also unlocked Samuel Green&#39;s prison-doors and he was allowed to go free.</p><p>After his liberation from the Penitentiary, we had from his own lips narrations of his years of suffering--of the bitter cup, that he was compelled to drink, and of his being sustained by the Almighty Arm--but no notes were taken at the time, consequently we have nothing more to add concerning him, save quite a faithful likeness.</p><p>[Illustration: ]</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>AN IRISH GIRL&#39;S DEVOTION TO FREEDOM.</p><p>IN LOVE WITH A SLAVE--GETS HIM OFF TO CANADA--FOLLOWS HIM--MARRIAGE, &amp;C. Having dwelt on the sad narratives of Samuel Green and his son in the preceding chapter, it is quite a relief to be able to introduce a traveler whose story contains incidents less painful to contemplate. From the record book the following brief account is taken:</p><p>&quot;April 27, 1855. John Hall arrived safely from Richmond, Va., per schooner, (Captain B). One hundred dollars were paid for his passage.&quot; In Richmond he was owned by James Dunlap, a merchant. John had been sold several times, in consequence of which, he had possessed very good opportunities of experiencing the effect of change of owners. Then, too, the personal examination made before sale, and the gratification afforded his master when he (John), brought a good price--left no very pleasing impressions on his mind.</p><p>By one of his owners, named Burke, John alleged that he had been &quot;cruelly used.&quot; When quite young, both he and his sister, together with their mother, were sold by Burke. From that time he had seen neither mother nor sister--they were sold separately. For three or four years the desire to seek liberty had been fondly cherished, and nothing but the want of a favorable opportunity had deterred him from carrying out his designs. He considered himself much &quot;imposed upon&quot; by his master, particularly as he was allowed &quot;no choice about living&quot; as he &quot;desired.&quot; This was indeed ill-treatment as John viewed the matter. John may have wanted too much. He was about thirty-five years of age, light complexion--tall--rather handsome-looking, intelligent, and of good manners. But notwithstanding these prepossessing features, John&#39;s owner valued him at only $1,000. If he had been a few shades darker and only about half as intelligent as he was, he would have been worth at least $500 more. The idea of having had a white father, in many instances, depreciated the pecuniary value of male slaves, if not of the other sex. John emphatically was one of this injured class; he evidently had blood in his veins which decidedly warred against submitting to the yoke. In addition to the influence which such rebellious blood exerted over him, together with a considerable amount of intelligence, he was also under the influence and advice of a daughter of old Ireland. She was heart and soul with John in all his plans which looked Canada-ward. This it was that &quot;sent him away.&quot;</p><p>It is very certain, that this Irish girl was not annoyed by the kinks in John&#39;s hair. Nor was she overly fastidious about the small percentage of colored blood visible in John&#39;s complexion. It was, however, a strange occurrence and very hard to understand. Not a stone was left unturned until John was safely on the Underground Rail Road. Doubtless she helped to earn the money which was paid for his passage. And when he was safe off, it is not too much to say, that John was not a whit more delighted than was his intended Irish lassie, Mary Weaver. John had no sooner reached Canada than Mary&#39;s heart was there too. Circumstances, however, required that she should remain in Richmond a number of months for the purpose of winding up some of her affairs. As soon as the way opened for her, she followed him. It was quite manifest, that she had not let a single opportunity slide, but seized the first chance and arrived partly by means of the Underground Rail Road and partly by the regular train. Many difficulties were surmounted before and after leaving Richmond, by which they earned their merited success. From Canada, where they anticipated entering upon the matrimonial career with mutual satisfaction, it seemed to afford them great pleasure to write back frequently, expressing their heartfelt gratitude for assistance, and their happiness in the prospect of being united under the favorable auspices of freedom! At least two or three of these letters, bearing on particular phases of their escape, etc., are too valuable not to be published in this connection:</p><p>FIRST LETTER.</p><pre><code>HAMILTON, March 25th, 1856.

friendly thing in his life which he did do one friendly act, if
he will take this on himself, and if money should be lacking I
will forward any money that he may require, I hope you will
sympathize with the poor young fellow, and tell the captain to
do all in his power to get him and the costs shall be paid. He
lies now between death or victory, for I know the man he belongs
to would just as soon kill him as not, if he catches him, I here

you the money to pay the expenses of the carriage clear through.
Please to let Mr. Mayo know how to direct a box to you, and the

trifle for postage which you will please to keep on account of

DEAR SIR:--I am happy to inform you that we are both enjoying
good health and hope you are the same. I have been expecting a
letter from you for some time but I suppose your business has
prevented you from writing. I suppose you have not heard from
any of my friends at Richmond. I have been longing to hear some
news from that part, you may think &quot;Out of sight and out of
mind,&quot; but I can assure you, no matter how far I may be, or in
what distant land, I shall never forget you, if I can never
reach you by letters you may be sure I shall always think of
you. I have found a great many friends in my life, but I must
say you are the best one I ever met with, except one, you must
know who that is, &#39;tis one who if I did not consider a friend, I
could not consider any other person a friend, and that is Mrs.
Hall. Please to let me know if the navigation between New York &amp;
Richmond is closed. Please to let me know whether it would be
convenient to you to go to New York if it is please let me know
what is the expense. Tell Mrs Still that my wife would be very
happy to receive a letter from her at some moment when she is at
leisure, for I know from what little I have seen of domestic
affairs it keeps her pretty well employed, And I know she has
not much time to write but if it were but two lines, she would
be happy to receive it from her, my reason for wanting you to go
to New York, there is a young man named Richard Myers and I
should like for you to see him. He goes on board the Orono to
Richmond and is a particular friend of mine and by seeing him I
could get my clothes from Richmond, I expect to be out of employ
in a few days, as the hotel is about to close on the 1st January

how you and all the family are and all the news you can, you
must excuse my short letter, as it is now near one o&#39;clock and I
must attend to business, but I have not written half what I
intended to, as time is short, hoping to hear from you soon I
remain yours sincerely,

</code></pre><p>It cannot be denied that this is a most extraordinary occurrence. In some respects it is without a parallel. It was, however, no uncommon thing for white men (slave-holders) in the South to have colored wives and children whom, they did not hesitate to live with and acknowledge by their actions, with their means, and in their wills as the rightful heirs of their substance. Probably there is not a state in the Union where such relations have not existed. Seeing such usages, Mary might have reasoned that she had as good a right to marry the one she loved most as anybody else, particularly as she was in a &quot;free country.&quot;</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>&quot;SAM&quot; NIXON ALIAS DR. THOMAS BAYNE.</p><p>THE ESCAPE OF A DENTIST ON THE U.G.R.R.--HE IS TAKEN FOR AN IMPOSTOR--ELECTED A MEMBER OF CITY COUNCIL IN NEW BEDFORD--STUDYING MEDICINE, ETC. But few could be found among the Underground Rail Road passengers who had a stronger repugnance to the unrequited labor system, or the recognized terms of &quot;master and slave,&quot; than Dr. Thomas Bayne. Nor were many to be found who were more fearless and independent in uttering their sentiments. His place of bondage was in the city of Norfolk, Va., where he was held to service by Dr. C.F. Martin, a dentist of some celebrity. While with Dr. Martin, &quot;Sam&quot; learned dentistry in all its branches, and was often required by his master, the doctor, to fulfil professional engagements, both at home and at a distance, when it did not suit his pleasure or convenience to appear in person. In the mechanical department, especially, &quot;Sam&quot; was called upon to execute the most difficult tasks. This was not the testimony of &quot;Sam&quot; alone; various individuals who were with him in Norfolk, but had moved to Philadelphia, and were living there at the time of his arrival, being invited to see this distinguished professional piece of property, gave evidence which fully corroborated his. The master&#39;s professional practice, according to &quot;Sam&#39;s&quot; calculation, was worth $3,000 per annum. Full $1,000 of this amount in the opinion of &quot;Sam&quot; was the result of his own fettered hands. Not only was &quot;Sam&quot; serviceable to the doctor in the mechanical and practical branches of his profession, but as a sort of ready reckoner and an apt penman, he was obviously considered by the doctor, a valuable &quot;article.&quot; He would frequently have &quot;Sam&quot; at his books instead of a book-keeper. Of course, &quot;Sam&quot; had never received, from Dr. M., an hour&#39;s schooling in his life, but having perceptive faculties naturally very large, combined with much self-esteem, he could hardly help learning readily. Had his master&#39;s design to keep him in ignorance been ever so great, he would have found it a labor beyond his power. But there is no reason to suppose that Dr. Martin was opposed to Sam&#39;s learning to read and write. We are pleased to note that no charges of ill-treatment are found recorded against Dr. M. in the narrative of &quot;Sam.&quot;</p><p>True, it appears that he had been sold several times in his younger days, and had consequently been made to feel keenly, the smarts of Slavery, but nothing of this kind was charged against Dr. M., so that he may be set down as a pretty fair man, for aught that is known to the contrary, with the exception of depriving &quot;Sam&quot; of the just reward of his labor, which, according to St. James, is pronounced a &quot;fraud.&quot; The doctor did not keep &quot;Sam&quot; so closely confined to dentistry and book-keeping that he had no time to attend occasionally to outside duties. It appears that he was quite active and successful as an Underground Rail Road agent, and rendered important aid in various directions. Indeed, Sam had good reason to suspect that the slave-holders were watching him, and that if he remained, he would most likely find himself in &quot;hot water up to his eyes.&quot; Wisdom dictated that he should &quot;pull up stakes&quot; and depart while the way was open. He knew the captains who were then in the habit of taking similar passengers, but he had some fears that they might not be able to pursue the business much longer. In contemplating the change which he was about to make, &quot;Sam&quot; felt it necessary to keep his movements strictly private. Not even was he at liberty to break his mind to his wife and child, fearing that it would do them no good, and might prove his utter failure. His wife&#39;s name was Edna and his daughter was called Elizabeth; both were slaves and owned by E.P. Tabb, Esq., a hardware merchant of Norfolk.</p><p>No mention is made on the books, of ill-treatment, in connection with his wife&#39;s servitude; it may therefore be inferred, that her situation was not remarkably hard. It must not be supposed that &quot;Sam&quot; was not truly attached to his wife. He gave abundant proof of true matrimonial devotion, notwithstanding the secrecy of his arrangements for flight. Being naturally hopeful, he concluded that he could better succeed in securing his wife after obtaining freedom himself, than in undertaking the task beforehand.</p><p>The captain had two or three other Underground Rail Road male passengers to bring with him, besides &quot;Sam,&quot; for whom, arrangements had been previously made--no more could be brought that trip. At the appointed time, the passengers were at the disposal of the captain of the schooner which was to bring them out of Slavery into freedom. Fully aware of the dangerous consequences should he be detected, the captain, faithful to his promise, secreted them in the usual manner, and set sail northward. Instead of landing his passengers in Philadelphia, as was his intention, for some reason or other (the schooner may have been disabled), he landed them on the New Jersey coast, not a great distance from Cape Island. He directed them how to reach Philadelphia. Sam knew of friends in the city, and straightway used his ready pen to make known the distress of himself and partners in tribulation. In making their way in the direction of their destined haven, they reached Salem, New Jersey, where they were discovered to be strangers and fugitives, and were directed to Abigail Goodwin, a Quaker lady, an abolitionist, long noted for her devotion to the cause of freedom, and one of the most liberal and faithful friends of the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia.</p><p>This friend&#39;s opportunities of witnessing fresh arrivals had been rare, and perhaps she had never before come in contact with a &quot;chattel&quot; so smart as &quot;Sam.&quot; Consequently she was much embarrassed when she heard his story, especially when he talked of his experience as a &quot;Dentist.&quot; She was inclined to suspect that he was a &quot;shrewd impostor&quot; that needed &quot;watching&quot; instead of aiding. But her humanity forbade a hasty decision on this point. She was soon persuaded to render him some assistance, notwithstanding her apprehensions. While tarrying a day or two in Salem, &quot;Sam&#39;s&quot; letter was received in Philadelphia. Friend Goodwin was written to in the meantime, by a member of the Committee, directly with a view of making inquires concerning the stray fugitives, and at the same time to inform her as to how they happened to be coming in the direction found by her. While the mind of the friend was much relieved by the letter she received, she was still in some doubt, as will be seen by the appended extract from a letter on the subject:</p><p>LETTER FROM A. GOODWIN.</p><pre><code>SALEM, 3 mo., 25, &#39;55.

DEAR FRIEND:--Thine of the 22d came to hand yesterday noon.

I do not believe that any of them are the ones thee wrote about,
who wanted Dr. Lundy to come for them, and promised they would
pay his expenses. They had no money, the minister said, but were
pretty well off for clothes. I gave him all I had and more, but
it seemed very little for four travelers--only a dollar for
each--but they will meet with friends and helpers on the way. He
said they expected to go away to-morrow. I am afraid, it&#39;s so
cold, and one of them had a sore foot, they will not get
away--it&#39;s dangerous staying here. There has been a slave-hunter
here lately, I was told yesterday, in search of a woman; he
tracked her to our Alms-house--she had lately been confined and
was not able to go--he will come back for her and his
infant--and will not wait long I expect. I want much to get her
away first--and if one had a C.C. Torney here no doubt it would
be done; but she will be well guarded. How much I wish the poor
thing could be secreted in some safe place till she is able to
travel Northward; but where that could be it&#39;s not easy to see.
I presume the Carolina freed people have arrived ere now. I hope
they will meet many friends, and be well provided for. Mary
Davis will be then paid--her cousins have sent her twenty-four
dollars, as it was not wanted for the purchase money--it was to
be kept for them when they arrive. I am glad thee did keep the
ten for the fugitives.

Samuel Nixon is now here, just come--a smart young man--they
will be after him soon. I advise him to hurry on to Canada; he
will leave here to-morrow, but don&#39;t say that he will go
straight to the city. I would send this by him if he did. I am
afraid he will loiter about and be taken--do make them go on
fast--he has left. I could not hear much he said--some who did
don&#39;t like him at all--think him an impostor--a great brag--said
he was a dentist ten years. He was asked where he came from, but
would not tell till he looked at the letter that lay on the
table and that he had just brought back. I don&#39;t feel much
confidence in him--don&#39;t believe he is the one thee alluded to.
He was asked his name--he looked at the letter to find it out.
Says nobody can make a better set of teeth than he can. He said
they will go on to-morrow in the stage--he took down the number
and street of the Anti-slavery office--you will be on your guard
against imposition--he kept the letter thee sent from Norfolk. I
had then no doubt of him, and had no objection to it. I now
rather regret it. I would send it to thee if I had it, but
perhaps it is of no importance.

He wanted the names taken down of nine more who expected to get
off soon and might come here. He told us to send them to him,
but did not seem to know where he was going to. He was well
dressed in fine broad-cloth coat and overcoat, and has a very
active tongue in his head.

But I have said enough--don&#39;t want to prejudice thee against
him, but only be on thy guard, and do not let him deceive thee,

</code></pre><p>In due time Samuel and his companions reached Philadelphia, where a cordial welcome awaited them. The confusion and difficulties into which they had fallen, by having to travel an indirect route, were fully explained, and to the hearty merriment of the Committee and strangers, the dilemma of their good Quaker friend Goodwin at Salem was alluded to. After a sojourn of a day or two in Philadelphia, Samuel and his companions left for New Bedford. Canada was named to them as the safest place for all Refugees; but it was in vain to attempt to convince &quot;Sam&quot; that Canada or any other place on this Continent, was quite equal to New Bedford. His heart was there, and there he was resolved to go--and there he did go too, bearing with him his resolute mind, determined, if possible, to work his way up to an honorable position at his old trade, Dentistry, and that too for his own benefit.</p><p>Aided by the Committee, the journey was made safely to the desired haven, where many old friends from Norfolk were found. Here our hero was known by the name of Dr. Thomas Bayne--he was no longer &quot;Sam.&quot; In a short time the Dr. commenced his profession in an humble way, while, at the same time, he deeply interested himself in his own improvement, as well as the improvement of others, especially those who had escaped from Slavery as he himself had. Then, too, as colored men were voters and, therefore, eligible to office in New Bedford, the Doctor&#39;s naturally ambitious and intelligent, turn of mind led him to take an interest in politics, and before he was a citizen of New Bedford four years, he was duly elected a member of the City Council. He was also an outspoken advocate of the cause of temperance, and was likewise a ready speaker at Anti-slavery meetings held by his race. Some idea of his abilities, and the interest he took in the Underground Rail Road, education, etc., may be gathered from the appended letters:</p><pre><code>NEW BEDFORD, June 23d, 1855.

My Dear Friend:--Yours of the 3d inst. reached me safely in the
midst of my misfortune. I suppose you have learned that my
office and other buildings burned down during the recent fire.
My loss is $550, insured $350.

I would have written you before, but I have been to R.I. for
some time and soon after I returned before I examined the books,
the fire took place, and this accounts for my delay. In regard
to the books I am under many obligations to you and all others
for so great a piece of kindness, and shall ever feel indebted
to you for the same. I shall esteem them very highly for two
reasons, first, The way in which they come, that is through and
by your Vigilance as a colored man helping a colored man to get
such knowledge as will give the lie to our enemies.
Secondly--their contents being just the thing I needed at this
time. My indebtedness to you and all concerned for me in this
direction is inexpressible. There are some books the Doctor says
I must have, such as the Medical Dictionary, Physician&#39;s
Dictionary, and a work on Anatomy. These I will have to get, but
any work that may be of use to a student of anatomy or medicine
will be thankfully received. You shall hear from me again soon.

Truly Yours,

NEW BEDFORD, March 18th, 1861.

Mr. Wm. Still:--Dear Sir--Dr. Powell called to see me and
informed me that you had a medical lexicon (Dictionary) for me.
If you have such a book for me, it will be very thankfully
received, and any other book that pertains to the medical or
dental profession. I am quite limited in means as yet and in
want of books to prosecute my studies. The books I need most at
present is such as treat on midwifery, anatomy, &amp;c. But any book
or books in either of the above mentioned cases will be of use
to me. You can send them by Express, or by any friend that may
chance to come this way, but by Express will be the safest way
to send them. Times are quite dull. This leaves me well and hope
it may find you and family the same. My regards to your wife and
all others.

</code></pre><p>Thus the doctor continued to labor and improve his mind until the war removed the hideous institution of Slavery from the nation; but as soon as the way opened for his return to his old home, New Bedford no longer had sufficient attractions to retain him. With all her faults he conceived that &quot;Old Virginia&quot; offered decided inducements for his return. Accordingly he went directly to Norfolk, whence he escaped. Of course every thing was in the utmost confusion and disorder when he returned, save where the military held sway. So as soon as the time drew near for reorganizing, elections, &amp;c., the doctor was found to be an aspirant for a seat in Congress, and in &quot;running&quot; for it, was found to be a very difficult candidate to beat. Indeed in the first reports of the election his name was amongst the elected; but subsequent counts proved him to be among the defeated by only a very slight majority.</p><p>At the time of the doctor&#39;s escape, in 1855, he was thirty-one years of age, a man of medium size, and about as purely colored, as could readily be found, with a full share of self-esteem and pluck.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>SUNDRY ARRIVALS</p><p>FROM LOUDON CO., VA., NORFOLK, BALTIMORE, MD., PETERSBURG, VA., &amp;C., ABOUT THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1855. Arrival 1st. David Bennett and family. Arrival 2d. Henry Washington, alias Anthony Hanly, and Henry Stewart. Arrival 3d. William Nelson and wife, William Thomas, Louisa Bell, and Elias Jasper. Arrival 4th. Maria Joiner. Arrival 5th. Richard Green and his brother George. Arrival 6th. Henry Cromwell. Arrival 7th. Henry Bohm. Arrival 8th. Ralph Whiting, James H. Forman, Anthony Atkinson, Arthur Jones, Isaiah Nixon, Joseph Harris, John Morris, Henry Hodges. Arrival 9th. Robert Jones and wife.</p><p>The first arrival to be here noticed consisted of David Bennett, and his wife Martha, with their two children, a little boy named George, and a nameless babe one month old. This family journeyed from Loudon county, Va. David, the husband, had been in bonds under Captain James Taylor. Martha, the wife, and her two children were owned by George Carter. Martha&#39;s master was represented as a very barbarous and cruel man to the slaves. He made a common practice of flogging females when stripped naked. This was the emphatic testimony of Martha. Martha declared that she had been so stripped, and flogged by him after her marriage. The story of this interesting young mother, who was about twenty-seven years of age, was painful to the ear, particularly as the earnestness and intelligence of this poor, bruised, and mangled soul bore such strong evidence to the truthfulness of her statements. During the painful interview the mind would involuntarily picture this demon, only as the representative of thousands in the South using the same relentless sway over men and women; and this fleeing victim and her little ones, before escaping, only as sharers of a common lot with many other mothers and children, whose backs were daily subjected to the lash. If on such an occasion it was hard to find fitting words of sympathy, or adequate expressions of indignation, the pleasure of being permitted to give aid and comfort to such was in part a compensation and a relief. David, the husband of this woman, was about thirty-two years of age. No further notice was made of him.</p><p>Arrival No. 2 consisted of Henry Washington, alias Anthony Hanly, and Henry Stewart. Henry left Norfolk and a &quot;very mild master,&quot; known by the name of &quot;Seth March,&quot; out of sheer disgust for the patriarchal institution. Directly after speaking of his master in such flattering terms he qualified the &quot;mild,&quot; &amp;c. by adding that he was excessively close in money matters. In proof of this assertion, Henry declared, that out of his hire he was only allowed $1.50 per week to pay his board, clothe himself, and defray all other expenses; leaving no room whatever for him to provide for his wife. It was, therefore, a never-failing source of unhappiness to be thus debarred, and it was wholly on this account that he &quot;took out,&quot; as he did, and at the time that he did. His wife&#39;s name was &quot;Sally.&quot; She too was a slave, but &quot;had not been treated roughly.&quot;</p><p>For fifty long years Henry had been in the grasp of this merciless system--constrained to toil for the happiness of others, to make them comfortable, rich, indolent, and tyrannical. To say that he was like a bird out of a cage, conveys in no sense whatever the slightest idea of his delight in escaping from the prison house. And yet, his pleasure was sadly marred by the reflection that his bosom companion was still in bondage in the gloomy prison-house. Henry was a man of dark color, well made, and of a reflective turn of mind. On arriving in Canada, he manifested his gratitude through Rev. H. Wilson, as follows--</p><pre><code>ST. CATHARINES, Aug. 20th, 1855.

DEAR BR. STILL:--I am requested by Henry Washington to inform
you that he got through safe, and is here in good business. He
returns to you his sincere thanks for your attention to him on
his way. I had the pleasure of receiving seven fugitives last
week. Send them on, and may God speed them in the flight. I
would like to have a miracle-working power, that I could give
wings to them all so that they could come faster than by
Railroads either underground or above.

Yours truly,

HIRAM WILSON.
</code></pre><p>While he was thus hopefully succeeding in Canada, separated from his companion by many hundreds of miles, death came and liberated her from the yoke, as the subjoined letter indicates--</p><pre><code>ST. CATHARINES, C.W. Nov. 12, 1855.

MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_:--I have received a letter from
Joseph G. Selden a friend in Norfolk, Va., informing me of the

</code></pre><p>Henry Stewart, who accompanied the above mentioned traveler to Canada, had fled a short while before from Plymouth, North Carolina. James Monroe Woodhouse, a farmer, claimed Stewart as his property, and &quot;hired him out&quot; for $180 per annum. As a master, Woodhouse was considered to be of the &quot;moderate&quot; type, according to Stewart&#39;s judgment. But respecting money matters (when his slaves wanted a trifle), &quot;he was very hard. He did not flog, but would not give a slave a cent of money upon any consideration.&quot;</p><p>It was by procuring a pass to Norfolk, that Henry managed to escape. Although a father and a husband, having a wife (Martha) and two children (Mary Ann and Susan Jane), he felt that his lot as a slave utterly debarred him from discharging his duty to them; that he could exercise no rights or privileges whatever, save as he might obtain permission from his master. In the matter of separation, even although the ties of husband and wife, parents and children were most closely knit, his reason dictated that he would be justified in freeing himself if possible; indeed, he could not endure the pressure of Slavery any longer. Although only twenty-three years of age, the burdens that he had been called upon to bear, made his naturally intelligent mind chafe to an unusual degree, especially when reflecting upon a continued life of Slavery. When the time decided upon for his flight arrived, he said nothing to his wife on the subject, but secured his pass and took his departure for Norfolk. On arriving there, he sought out an Underground Rail Road captain, and arranged with him to bring him to Philadelphia. Whether the sorrow-stricken wife ever afterwards heard of her husband, or the father of his two little children, the writer is unable to say. It is possible that this narrative may reveal to the mother and her offspring (if they are still living), the first ray of light concerning the missing one. Indeed it is not unreasonable to suppose, that thousands of anxious wives, husbands and children, who have been scattered in every direction by Slavery, will never be able to learn as much of their lost ones as is contained in this brief account of Henry Stewart.</p><p>Arrival No. 3, brought William Nelson, his wife, Susan, and son, William Thomas, together with Louisa Bell, and Elias Jasper. These travelers availed themselves of the schooner of Captain B. who allowed them to embark at Norfolk, despite the search laws of Virginia. It hardly need be said, however, that it was no trifling matter in those days, to evade the law. Captains and captives, in order to succeed, found that it required more than ordinary intelligence and courage, shrewdness and determination, and at the same time, a very ardent appreciation of liberty, without which, there could be no success. The simple announcement then, that a party of this number had arrived from Norfolk, or Richmond, or Petersburg, gave the Committee unusual satisfaction. It made them quite sure that there was pluck and brain somewhere.</p><p>These individuals, in a particularly marked degree, possessed the qualities that greatly encouraged the efforts of the Committee. William Nelson, was a man of a dark chestnut color, medium size, with more than an ordinary degree of what might be termed &quot;mother wit.&quot; Apparently, William possessed well settled convictions, touching the questions of morals and religion, despite the overflowing tide of corruption and spurious religious teachings consequent on the existing pro-slavery usages all around him. He was a member of the Methodist Church, under the charge of the Rev. Mr. Jones. For twenty years, William had served in the capacity of a &quot;packer&quot; under Messrs. Turner and White, who held a deed for William as their legal property. While he declared that he had been very &quot;tightly worked&quot; he nevertheless admitted that he had been dealt with in a mild manner in some respects.</p><p>For his board and clothing, William had been allowed $1.50 per week. Truly a small sum for a hard-working man with a family--yet this was far more than many slaves received from their masters. In view of receiving this small pittance, he had toiled hard--doing over-work in order to make &quot;buckle and strap meet.&quot; Once he had been sold on the auction-block. A sister of his had also shared the same fate. While seriously contemplating his life as a slave, he was soon led to the conclusion that it was his duty to bend his entire energies towards freeing himself and his family if possible. The idea of not being able to properly provide for his family rendered him quite unhappy; he therefore resolved to seek a passage North, via the Underground Rail Road. To any captain who would aid him in the matter, he resolved to offer a large reward, and determined that the amount should only be limited by his inability to increase it. Finally, after much anxious preparation, agreement was entered into with Captain B., on behalf of himself, wife, child, and Louisa Bell, which was mutually satisfactory to all concerned, and afforded great hope to William. In due time the agreement was carried into effect, and all arrived safely and were delivered into the hands of the Committee in Philadelphia. The fare of the four cost $240, and William was only too grateful to think, that a Captain could be found who would risk his own liberty in thus aiding a slave to freedom.</p><p>The Committee gladly gave them aid and succor, and agreed with William that the Captain deserved all that he received for their deliverance. The arrival of William, wife, and child in Canada was duly announced by the agent at St. Catharines, Rev. H. Wilson, as follows:</p><pre><code>ST. CATHARINES, C.W., June 28th, 1855.

</code></pre><p>The man who came to us as Wm. Nelson, is now known only as &quot;Thomas Russell.&quot; It may here be remarked, that, owing to the general custom of changing names, as here instanced, it is found difficult to tell to whom the letters severally refer. Where the old and new names were both carefully entered on the book there is no difficulty, of course, but it was not always thus.</p><p>Susan Bell, the wife of William, was about thirty years of age, of a dark color, rather above medium size, well-made, good-looking, and intelligent--quite equal to her husband, and appeared to have his affections undividedly. She was owned by Thomas Baltimore, with whom she had lived for the last seven years. She stated that during a part of her life she had been treated in a &quot;mild manner.&quot; She had no complaint to make until after the marriage of her master. Under the new wife and mistress, Susan found a very marked change for the worse. She fared badly enough then. The mistress, on every trifling occasion for complaint, was disposed to hold the auction-block up to Susan, and would likewise influence her husband to do the same. From the fact, that four of Susan&#39;s sisters had been sold away to &quot;parts unknown,&quot; she was not prepared to relish these almost daily threats from her irritable mistress, so she became as anxious for a trip on the Underground Rail Road as was her husband.</p><p>About one hundred miles away in the country, her father, mother, three brothers, and one sister were living; but she felt that she could not remain a slave on their account. Susan&#39;s owner had already fixed a price on her and her child, twenty-two months old, which was one thousand dollars. From this fate she was saved only by her firm resolution to seek her freedom.</p><p>Louisa Bell was also of Wm. Nelson&#39;s party, and a fair specimen of a nice-looking, wide awake woman; of a chestnut color, twenty-eight years of age. She was the wife of a free man, but the slave of L. Stasson, a confectioner. The almost constant ringing in her ears of the auction-block, made her most miserable, especially as she had once suffered terribly by being sold, and had likewise seen her mother, and five sisters placed in the same unhappy situation, the thought of which never ceased to be most painful. In reflecting upon the course which she was about to pursue in order to free herself from the prison-house, she felt more keenly than ever for her little children, and readily imagined how sadly she would mourn while thinking of them hundreds of miles distant, growing up only to be slaves. And particularly would her thoughts dwell upon her boy, six years of age; full old enough to feel deeply the loss of his mother, but without hope of ever seeing her again.</p><p>Heart-breaking as were these reflections, she resolved to leave Robert and Mary in the hands of God, and escape, if possible from her terrible thraldom. Her plan was submitted to her husband; he acquiesced fully and promised to follow her as soon as an opportunity might present itself. Although the ordeal that she was called upon to pass through was of the most trying nature she bravely endured the journey through to Canada. On her arrival there the Rev. H. Wilson wrote on behalf of herself, and the cause as follows:</p><pre><code>ST. CATHERINES, C.W. July 6th, 1855.

DEAR BR. STILL:--I have just received your letters touching
U.G.R.R. operations. All is right. Jasper and Mrs. Bell got here

and are likely to do well. The 5 of last week have gone over to
Toronto. I gave them letters to a friend there after furnishing
them as well as I could with such clothing as they required. I
am afraid that I am burdening you too much with postage, but
can&#39;t help doing so unless I fail to write at all, as my means
are not half equal to the expenses to which I am subject.

</code></pre><p>Elias Jasper, who was also a fellow-passenger with Wm. Nelson and Co., was noticed thus on the Underground Rail Road: Age thirty-two years, color dark, features good, and gifted both with his tongue and hands. He had worked more or less at the following trades: Rope-making, carpentering, engineering, and photographing. It was in this latter calling that he was engaged when the Underground Rail Road movement first arrested his attention, and so continued until his departure.</p><p>For several years he had been accustomed to hire his time, for which he had been required to pay $10 per month. In acquiring the above trades he had been at no expense to his master, as he had learned them solely by his own perseverance, endowed as he was with a considerable share of genius. Occasionally he paid for lessons, the money being earned by his over-work. His master, Bayham, was a &quot;retired gentleman.&quot;</p><p>Elias had been sold once, and had suffered in various other ways, particularly from being flogged. He left his wife, Mary, but no child. Of his intention to leave Elias saw not how to impart to his wife, lest she should in some way let the &quot;cat out of the bag.&quot; She was owned by a Miss Portlock, and had been treated &quot;tolerably well,&quot; having had the privilege of hiring her time. She had $55 to pay for this favor, which amount she raised by washing, etc. Elias was a member of the Methodist Church, as were all of his comrades, and well did they remember the oft-repeated lesson, &quot;Servants obey your masters,&quot; etc. They soon understood this kind of preaching after breathing free air. The market value of Elias was placed at $1200.</p><p>Arrival, No. 4. Maria Joiner. Captain F. arrived, from Norfolk, with the above named passenger, the way not being open to risk any other on that occasion. This seemed rather slow business with this voyager, for he was usually accustomed to bringing more than one. However, as this arrival was only one day later than the preceding one noticed, and came from the same place, the Committee concluded, that they had much reason for rejoicing nevertheless. As in the case of a great number among the oppressed of the South, when simply looking at Maria, no visible marks of ill usage in any way were discernible. Indeed, as she then appeared at the age of thirty-three, a fine, fresh, and healthy-looking mulatto woman, nine out of every ten would have been impressed with the idea, that she had never been subjected to hard treatment; in other words, that she had derived her full share of advantages from the &quot;Patriarchal Institution.&quot; The appearance of just such persons in Southern cities had often led Northerners, when traveling in those parts, to regard the lot of slaves as quite comfortable. But the story of Maria, told in an earnest and intelligent manner, was at once calculated to dissipate the idea of a &quot;comfortable&quot; existence in a state of bondage. She frankly admitted, however, that prior to the death of her old master, she was favorably treated, compared with many others; but, unfortunately, after his death, she had fallen into the hands of one of the old man&#39;s daughters, from whom, she declared, that she had received continued abuse, especially when said daughter was under the influence of liquor. At such times she was very violent. Being spirited, Maria could not consent to suffer on as a slave in this manner. Consequently she began to cogitate how she might escape from her mistress (Catharine Gordon), and reach a free State. None other than the usual trying and hazardous ways could be devised--which was either to be stowed away in the hold of a schooner, or concealed amongst the rubbish of a steamer, where, for the time being, the extreme suffering was sure to tax every nerve even of the most valiant-hearted men. The daily darkening prospects constrained her to decide, that she was willing to suffer, not only in adopting this mode of travel, but on the other hand, that she had better be dead than remain under so cruel a woman as her mistress. Maria&#39;s husband and sister (no other relatives are noticed), were naturally formidable barriers in the way of her escape. Notwithstanding her attachment to them, she fully made up her mind to be free. Immediately she took the first prerequisite step, which was to repair to a place of concealment with a friend in the city, and there, like the man at the pool, wait until her turn came to be conveyed thence to a free State. In this place she was obliged to wait eight long months, enduring daily suffering in various ways, especially during the winter season. But, with martyr-like faith, she endured to the end, and was eventually saved from the hell of Slavery. Maria was appraised at $800.</p><p>Arrival No. 5. Richard Green, alias Wm. Smith, and his brother George. These young brothers fled from George Chambers of Baltimore. The elder brother was twenty-five, the younger twenty-three. Both were tall and well made and of a chestnut color, and possessed a good degree of natural ability. When desiring to visit their parents, their request was positively refused by their owner. Taking offence at this step, both mutually resolved to run away at the earliest opportunity. Thus in accordance with well premeditated plans, they set out and unobstructedly arrived in Philadelphia. At first it was simply very pleasant to take them by the hand and welcome them; then to listen for a few moments to their intelligent narration of how they escaped, the motives that prompted them, etc. But further inquiries soon brought out incidents of the most thrilling and touching nature--not with regard to hardships which they had personally experienced, but in relation to outrages which had been perpetrated upon their mother. Such simple facts as were then written are substantially as follows: Nearly thirty years prior to the escape of Richard and his brother their mother was in very bad health, so much so that physicians regarded her incurable. Her owner was evidently fully impressed with the belief that instead of being profitable to him, she might be an expense, which he could not possibly obviate, while he retained her as a slave. Now there was a way to get out of this dilemma. He could emancipate her and throw the responsibility of her support upon, herself. Accordingly he drew up papers, called for his wife&#39;s mother to witness them, then formally put them into the hands of the invalid slave woman (Dinah), assuring her at the same time, that she was free--being fully released as set forth in her papers. &quot;Take notice I have no more claim on you nor you on me from this time.&quot; Marvellous liberality! After working the life out of a woman, in order that he should not have her to bury, he becomes hastily in favor of freedom. He is, however, justified by the laws of Maryland. Complaint, therefore, would simply amount to nothing. In the nature of the case Dinah was now free, but she was not wholly alone in the world. She had a husband, named Jacob Green, who was owned by Nathan Childs for a term of years only, at the expiration of which time he was to be free. All lived then in Talbot county, Md. At the appointed time Jacob&#39;s bondage ended, and he concluded that he might succeed better by moving to Baltimore. Indeed the health of his wife was so miserable that nothing in his old home seemed to offer any inducement in the way of a livelihood. So off they moved to Baltimore. After a time, under careful and kind treatment, the faithful Jacob was greatly encouraged by perceiving that the health of his companion was gradually improving--signs indicated, that she might yet become a well woman. The hopes of husband and wife, in this particular, were, in the lapse of time, fully realized. Dinah was as well as ever, and became the mother of another child--a little boy. Everything seemed to be going on happily, and they had no apparent reason to suspect any troubles other than such as might naturally have to be encountered in a state of poverty and toil.</p><p>The unfettered boy was healthy, and made rapid advance in a few years. That any one should ever claim him was never for a moment feared.</p><p>The old master, however, becoming tired of country life, had also moved to Baltimore. How, they knew not, but he had heard of the existence of this boy.</p><p>That he might satisfy himself on this point, he one day very slyly approached the house with George. No sooner was the old man within the enclosures than he asked Dinah, &quot;Whose child is that?&quot; pointing to the boy. &quot;Ask Jacob,&quot; was the reply of the mother. The question was then put to Jacob, the father of the boy. &quot;I did not think that you would ask such a question, or that you would request anything like that,&quot; Jacob remarked, naturally somewhat nervous, but he added, &quot;I have the privilege of having any one I please in my house.&quot; &quot;Where is he from?&quot; again demanded the master. The father repeated, &quot;I have a right to have,&quot; etc., &quot;I am my own man,&quot; etc. &quot;I have found out whose he is,&quot; the hunter said. &quot;I am going presently to take him home with me.&quot; At this juncture he seized the little fellow, at the same time calling out, &quot;Dinah, put his clothes on.&quot; By this time the father too had seized hold of the child. Mustering courage, the father said, &quot;Take notice that you are not in the country, pulling and hauling people about.&quot; &quot;I will have him or I will leave my heart&#39;s blood in the house,&quot; was the savage declaration of the master. In his rage he threatened to shoot the father. In the midst of the excitement George called in two officers to settle the trouble. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; said the officers to the slave-holder. &quot;I am after my property--this boy,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Have you ever seen it before?&quot; they inquired. &quot;No,&quot; said the slave-holder. &quot;Then how do you know that he belongs to you?&quot; inquired the officers. &quot;I believe he is mine,&quot; replied the slave-holder.</p><p>All the parties concerned were then taken by the officers before an Alderman. The father owned the child but the mother denied it. The Alderman then decided that the child should be given to the father.</p><p>The slave-holder having thus failed, was unwilling, nevertheless, to relinquish his grasp. Whereupon he at once claimed the mother. Of course he was under the necessity of resorting to the Courts in order to establish his claim. Fortunately the mother had securely preserved the paper given her by her master so many years before, releasing her. Notwithstanding this the suit was pending nearly a year before the case was decided. Everything was so clear the mother finally gained the suit. This decision was rendered only about two months prior to the escape of Richard and George.</p><p>Arrival No. 6. Henry Cromwell. This passenger fled from Baltimore county, Md. The man that he escaped from was a farmer by the name of William Roberts, who also owned seven other young slaves. Of his treatment of his slaves nothing was recorded.</p><p>Henry was about six feet high, quite black, visage thin, age twenty-five. He left neither wife, parents, brothers nor sisters to grieve after him. In making his way North he walked of nights from his home to Harrisburg, Pa., and there availed himself of a passage on a freight car coming to Philadelphia.</p><p>Arrival No. 7. Henry Bohm. Henry came from near Norfolk, Va. He was about twenty-five years of age, and a fair specimen of a stout man, possessed of more than ordinary physical strength. As to whom he fled from, how he had been treated, or how he reached Philadelphia, the record book is silent. Why this is the case cannot now be accounted for, unless the hurry of getting him off forbade sufficient delay to note down more of the particulars.</p><p>Arrival No. 8. Ralph Whiting, James H. Forman, Anthony Atkinson, Arthur Jones, Isaiah Nixon, Joseph Harris, John Morris, and Henry Hodges. A numerous party like this had the appearance of business. They were all young and hopeful, and belonged to the more intelligent and promising of their race. They were capable of giving the best of reasons for the endeavors they were making to escape to a free country.</p><p>They imparted to the Committee much information respecting their several situations, together with the characters of their masters in relation to domestic matters, and the customs and usages under which they had been severally held to service--all of which was listened to with deep interest. But it was not an easy matter, after having been thus entertained, to write out the narratives of eight such persons. Hundreds of pages would hardly have contained a brief account of the most interesting portion of their histories. It was deemed sufficient to enter their names and their forsaken homes, etc., as follows:</p><p>&quot;Ralph was twenty-six years of age, five feet ten inches high, dark, well made, intelligent, and a member of the Methodist Church. He was claimed by Geo. W. Kemp, Esq., cashier of the Exchange Bank of Norfolk, Va. Ralph gave Mr. Kemp the credit of being a &#39;moderate man&#39; to his slaves. Ralph was compelled to leave his wife, Lydia, and two children, Anna Eliza, and Cornelius.&quot;</p><p>&quot;James was twenty-three years of age, dark mulatto, nearly six feet high, and of prepossessing appearance. He fled from James Saunders, Esq. Nothing, save the desire to be free, prompted James to leave his old situation and master. His parents and two sisters he was obliged to leave in Norfolk.&quot;</p><p>Two brief letters from James, one concerning his &quot;sweet-heart,&quot; whom he left in Norfolk, the other giving an account of her arrival in Canada and marriage thereafter will, doubtless, be read with interest. They are here given as follows:</p><pre><code>NIAGARA FALLS, June 5th, 1856. MR. STILL:--Sir--I take my pen in

</code></pre><p>Anthony was thirty-six years of age, and by blood, was quite as nearly related to the Anglo-Saxon as the Anglo-African. He was nevertheless, physically a fine specimen of a man. He was about six feet high, and bore evidence of having picked up a considerable amount of intelligence considering his opportunities. He had been sold three times. Anthony was decidedly opposed to having to pass through this ordeal a fourth time, therefore, the more he meditated over his condition, the more determined he became to seek out an Underground Rail Road agent, and make his way to Canada.</p><p>Concluding that Josiah Wells, who claimed him, had received a thousand times too much of his labor already, Anthony was in a fit state of mind to make a resolute effort to gain his freedom. He had a wife, but no children. His father, one sister, and two brothers were all dear to him, but all being slaves &quot;one could not help the other,&quot; Anthony reasoned, and wisely too. So, at the command of the captain, he was ready to bear his part of the suffering consequent upon being concealed in the hold of a vessel, where but little air could penetrate.</p><p>Arthur was forty-one years of age, six feet high--chestnut color, well made, and possessed good native faculties needing cultivation. He escaped from a farmer, by the name of John Jones, who was classed, as to natural temperament, amongst &quot;moderate slave-holders.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wanted my liberty,&quot; said Arthur promptly and emphatically, and he declared that was the cause of his escape. He left his mother, two sisters, and three brothers in Slavery.</p><p>Isaiah was about twenty-two, small of stature, but smart, and of a substantially black complexion. He had been subjected to very hard treatment under Samuel Simmons who claimed him, and on this account he was first prompted to leave. His mother and three brothers he left in bondage.</p><p>Joseph was twenty-three years of age, and was, in every way, &quot;likely-looking.&quot; According to the laws of Slavery, he was the property of David Morris, who was entitled to be ranked amongst the more compassionate slave-holders of the South. Yet, Joseph was not satisfied, deprived of his freedom. He had not known hardships as many had, but it was not in him notwithstanding, to be contented as a slave. In leaving, he had to &quot;tear himself away&quot; from his parents, three brothers, and two sisters.</p><p>Henry escaped from S. Simmons of Plymouth, North Carolina, and was a fellow-servant with Isaiah. Simmons was particularly distinguished for his tyrannical rule and treatment of his slaves--so Henry and Isaiah had the good sense to withdraw from under his yoke, very young in life; Henry being twenty-three.</p><p>John was about twenty-one years of age, five feet eight inches high, dark color, and well-grown for his years. Before embarking, he had endured seven months of hard suffering from being secreted, waiting for an opportunity to escape. It was to keep his master from selling him, that he was thus induced to secrete himself. After he had remained away some months, he resolved to suffer on until his friends could manage to procure him a passage on the Underground Rail Road. With this determined spirit he did not wait in vain.</p><p>Arrival No. 9. Robert Jones and wife:--In the majority of cases, in order to effect the escape of either, sad separations between husbands and wives were unavoidable. Fortunately, it was not so in this case. In journeying from the house of bondage, Robert and his wife were united both in sympathies and in struggles. Robert had experienced &quot;hard times&quot; just in what way, however, was not recorded; his wife had been differently treated, not being under the same taskmaster as her husband. At the time of their arrival all that was recorded of their bondage is as follows--</p><p>August 2d, 1855, Robert Jones and wife, arrived from Petersburg, Va. Robert is about thirty-five, chestnut color, medium size, of good manners, intelligent, had been owned by Thomas N. Lee, &quot;a very hard man.&quot; Robert left because he &quot;wanted his liberty--always had from a boy.&quot; Eliza, his wife, is about forty years of age, chestnut color, nice-looking, and well-dressed. She belonged to Eliza H. Richie, who was called a &quot;moderate woman&quot; towards her slaves. Notwithstanding the limited space occupied in noting them on the record book, the Committee regarded them as being among the most worthy and brave travelers passing over the Underground Rail Road, and felt well satisfied that such specimens of humanity would do credit in Canada, not only to themselves, but to their race.</p><p>Robert had succeeded in learning to read and write tolerably well, and had thought much over the condition and wrongs of the race, and seemed to be eager to be where he could do something to lift his fellow-sufferers up to a higher plane of liberty and manhood. After an interview with Robert and his wife, in every way so agreeable, they were forwarded on in the usual manner, to Canada. While enjoying the sweets of freedom in Canada, he was not the man to keep his light under a bushel. He seemed to have a high appreciation of the potency of the pen, and a decidedly clear idea that colored men needed to lay hold of many enterprises with resolution, in order to prove themselves qualified to rise equally with other branches of the human family. Some of his letters, embracing his views, plans and suggestions, were so encouraging and sensible, that the Committee was in the habit of showing them to friendly persons, and indeed, extracts of some of his letters were deemed of sufficient importance to publish. One alone, taken from many letters received from him, must here suffice to illustrate his intelligence and efforts as a fugitive and citizen in Canada.</p><pre><code>Hamilton, C.W., August 9th, 1856.

MR. WM. STILL;--_Dear Friend_:--I take this opportunity of
writing you these few lines to inform you of my health, which is
good at present, &amp;c. * * * *

I was talking to you about going to Liberia, when I saw you
last, and did intend to start this fall, but I since looked at
the condition of the colored people in Canada. I thought I would
try to do something for their elevation as a nation, to place
them in the proper position to stand where they ought to stand.
In order to do this, I have undertaken to get up a military
company amongst them. They laughed at me to undertake such a
thing; but I did not relax my energies. I went and had an
interview with Major J.T. Gilepon, told him what my object was,
he encouraged me to go on, saying that he would do all he could
for the accomplishment of my object. He referred to _Sir Allan
McNab, &amp;c._ * * * * I took with me Mr. J.H. Hill to see him--he
told me that it should be done, and required us to write a
petition to the _Governor General_, which has been done. * * * *
The company is already organized. Mr. Howard was elected
Captain; J.H. Hill, 1st Lieutenant; Hezekiah Hill, Ensign;
Robert Jones, 1st Sergeant. The company&#39;s name is, Queen
Victoria&#39;s Rifle Guards. You may, by this, see what I have been
doing since I have been in Canada. When we receive our
appointments by the Government. I will send by express, my
daguerreotype in uniform.

My respects, &amp;c. &amp;c., Robert Jones.

</code></pre><p>When this arrival made its appearance, it was at first sight quite evident that one of the company was a man of more than ordinary parts, both physically and mentally. Likewise, taking them individually, their appearance and bearing tended largely to strengthen the idea that the spirit of freedom was rapidly gaining ground in the minds of the slaves, despite the efforts of the slave-holders to keep them in darkness. In company with the three men, for whom the above large reward was offered, came a woman by the name of Eliza Nokey.</p><p>As soon as the opportunity presented itself, the Active Committee feeling an unusual desire to hear their story, began the investigation by inquiring as to the cause of their escape, etc., which brought simple and homely but earnest answers from each. These answers afforded the best possible means of seeing Slavery in its natural, practical workings--of obtaining such testimony and representations of the vile system, as the most eloquent orator or able pen might labor in vain to make clear and convincing, although this arrival had obviously been owned by men of high standing. The fugitives themselves innocently stated that one of the masters, who was in the habit of flogging adult females, was a &quot;moderate man.&quot; Josiah Bailey was the leader of this party, and he appeared well-qualified for this position. He was about twenty-nine years of age, and in no particular physically, did he seem to be deficient. He was likewise civil and polite in his manners, and a man of good common sense. He was held and oppressed by William H. Hughlett, a farmer and dealer in ship timber, who had besides invested in slaves to the number of forty head. In his habits he was generally taken for a &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; man, &quot;though he was in the habit of flogging the slaves--females as well as males,&quot; after they had arrived at the age of maturity. This was not considered strange or cruel in Maryland. Josiah was the &quot;foreman&quot; on the place, and was entrusted with the management of hauling the ship-timber, and through harvesting and busy seasons was required to lead in the fields. He was regarded as one of the most valuable hands in that part of the country, being valued at $2,000. Three weeks before he escaped, Joe was &quot;stripped naked,&quot; and &quot;flogged&quot; very cruelly by his master, simply because he had a dispute with one of the fellow-servants, who had stolen, as Joe alleged, seven dollars of his hard earnings. This flogging, produced in Joe&#39;s mind, an unswerving determination to leave Slavery or die: to try his luck on the Underground Rail Road at all hazards. The very name of Slavery, made the fire fairly burn in his bones. Although a married man, having a wife and three children (owned by Hughlett), he was not prepared to let his affection for them keep him in chains--so Anna Maria, his wife, and his children Ellen, Anna Maria, and Isabella, were shortly widowed and orphaned by the slave lash.</p><p>William Bailey was owned by John C. Henry, a large slave-holder, and a very &quot;hard&quot; one, if what William alleged of him was true. His story certainly had every appearance of truthfulness. A recent brutal flogging had &quot;stiffened his back-bone,&quot; and furnished him with his excuse for not being willing to continue in Maryland, working his strength away to enrich his master, or the man who claimed to be such. The memorable flogging, however, which caused him to seek flight on the Underground Rail Road, was not administered by his master or on his master&#39;s plantation. He was hired out, and it was in this situation that he was so barbarously treated. Yet he considered his master more in fault than the man to whom he was hired, but redress there was none, save to escape.</p><p>The hour for forwarding the party by the Committee, came too soon to allow time for the writing of any account of Peter Pennington and Eliza Nokey. Suffice it to say, that in struggling through their journey, their spirits never flagged; they had determined not to stop short of Canada. They truly had a very high appreciation of freedom, but a very poor opinion of Maryland.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>SLAVE TRADER HALL IS FOILED.</p><p>ROBERT McCOY <em>alias</em> WILLIAM DONAR.</p><p>In October, 1854, the Committee received per steamer, directly from Norfolk, Va., Robert McCoy and Elizabeth Saunders. Robert had constantly been in the clutches of the negro-trader Hall, for the last sixteen years, previous to his leaving, being owned by him. He had, therefore, possessed very favorable opportunities for varied observation and experience relative to the trader&#39;s conduct in his nefarious business, as well as for witnessing the effects of the auction-block upon all ages--rending asunder the dearest ties, despite the piteous wails of childhood or womanhood, parental or conjugal relations. But no attempt will be made to chronicle the deeds of this dealer in human flesh. Those stories fresh from the lips of one who had just escaped, were painful in the extreme, but in the very nature of things some of the statements are too revolting to be published. In lieu of this fact, except the above allusions to the trader&#39;s business, this sketch will only refer to Robert&#39;s condition as a slave, and finally as a traveler on the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>Robert was a man of medium size, dark mulatto, of more than ordinary intelligence. His duties had been confined to the house, and not to the slave pen. As a general thing, he had managed, doubtless through much shrewdness, to avoid very severe outrages from the trader. On the whole, he had fared &quot;about as well&quot; as the generality of slaves.</p><p>Yet, in order to free himself from his &quot;miserable&quot; life, he was willing, as he declared, to suffer almost any sacrifice. Indeed, his conduct proved the sincerity of this declaration, as he had actually been concealed five months in a place in the city, where he could not possibly avoid daily suffering of the most trying kind. His resolve to be free was all this while maturing. The trader had threatened to sell Robert, and to prevent it Robert (thus) &quot;took out.&quot; Successfully did he elude the keen scent and grasp of the hunters, who made diligent efforts to recapture him. Although a young man--only about twenty-eight years of age, his health was by no means good. His system had evidently been considerably shattered by Slavery, and symptoms of consumption, together with chronic rheumatism, were making rapid headway against the physical man. Under his various ills, he declared, as did many others from the land of bondage, that his faith in God afforded him comfort and hope. He was obliged to leave his wife, Eliza, in bonds, not knowing whether they should ever meet again on earth, but he was somewhat hopeful that the way would open for her escape also.</p><p>After reaching Philadelphia, where his arrival had long been anticipated by the Vigilance Committee, his immediate wants were met, and in due order he was forwarded to New Bedford, where, he was led to feel, he would be happy in freedom.</p><p>Scarcely had he been in New Bedford one month, before his prayers and hopes were realized with regard to the deliverance of his wife. On hearing of the good news of her coming he wrote as follows--</p><pre><code>NEW BEDFORD, Nov. 3, 1859.

</code></pre><p>By the same arrival, and similarly secreted, Elizabeth Frances, alias Ellen Saunders, had the good luck to reach Philadelphia. She was a single young woman, about twenty-two, with as pleasant a countenance as one would wish to see. Her manners were equally agreeable. Perhaps her joy over her achieved victory added somewhat to her personal appearance. She had, however, belonged to the more favored class of slaves. She had neither been over-worked nor badly abused. Elizabeth was the property of a lady a few shades lighter than herself, (Elizabeth was a mulatto) by the name of Sarah Shephard, of Norfolk. In order the more effectually to profit by Elizabeth&#39;s labor, the mistress resorted to the plan of hiring her out for a given sum per month. Against this usage Elizabeth urged no complaint. Indeed the only very serious charge she brought was to the effect, that her mistress sold her mother away from her far South, when she was a child only ten years old. She had also sold a brother and sister to a foreign southern market. The reflections consequent upon the course that her mistress had thus pursued, awakened Elizabeth to much study relative to freedom, and by the time that she had reached womanhood she had very decided convictions touching her duty with regard to escaping. Thus growing to hate slavery in every way and manner, she was prepared to make a desperate effort to be free. Having saved thirty-five dollars by rigid economy, she was willing to give every cent of it (although it was all she possessed), to be aided from Norfolk to Philadelphia. After reaching the city, having suffered severely while coming, she was invited to remain until somewhat recruited. In the healthy air of freedom she was soon fully restored, and ready to take her departure for New Bedford, which place she reached without difficulty and was cordially welcomed. The following letter, expressive of her obligations for aid received, was forwarded soon after her arrival in New Bedford:</p><pre><code>NEW BEDFORD, Mass., October 16th, 1854.

MR. STILL:--Dear Sir--I now take my pen in my hand to inform you
of my health which is good at present all except a cold I have
got but I hope when these few lines reach you you may be
enjoying good health. I arrived in New Bedford Thursday morning
safely and what little I have seen of the city I like it very
much my friends were very glad to see me. I found my sister very
well. Give my love to Mrs. Still and also your dear little
children. I am now out at service. I do not think of going to
Canada now. I think I shall remain in this city this winter.
Please tell Mrs. Still I have not met any person who has treated
me any kinder than she did since I left. I consider you both to
have been true friends to me. I hope you will think me the same
to you. I feel very thankful to you indeed. It might been
supposed, out of sight out of mind, but it is not so. I never
forget my friends. Give my love to Florence. If you come to this
city I would be very happy to see you. Kiss your dear little
children for me. Please to answer this as soon as possible, so
that I may know you received this. No more at present. I still
remain your friend,

ELLEN SAUNDERS.
</code></pre><p>ELIZA MCCOY--the wife of Robert McCoy, whose narrative has just been given--and who was left to wait in hope when her husband escaped--soon followed him to freedom. It is a source of great satisfaction to be able to present her narrative in so close proximity to her husband&#39;s. He arrived about the first of October--she about the first of November, following. From her lips testimony of much weight and interest was listened to by several friends relative to her sufferings as a slave--on the auction-block, and in a place of concealment seven months, waiting and praying for an opportunity to escape. But it was thought sufficient to record merely a very brief outline of her active slave life, which consisted of the following noticeable features.</p><p>Eliza had been owned by Andrew Sigany, of Norfolk--age about thirty-eight--mulatto, and a woman whose appearance would readily command attention and respect anywhere outside of the barbarism of Slavery. She stated that her experience as a sufferer in cruel hands had been very trying, and that in fretting under hardships, she had &quot;always wanted to be free.&quot; Her language was unmistakable on this point. Neither mistress nor servant was satisfied with each other; the mistress was so &quot;queer&quot; and &quot;hard to please,&quot; that Eliza became heartily sick of trying to please her--an angel would have failed with such a woman. So, while matters were getting no better, but, on the contrary, were growing worse and worse, Eliza thought she would seek a more pleasant atmosphere in the North. In fact she felt that it would afford her no little relief to allow her place to be occupied by another. When she went into close quarters of concealment, she fully understood what was meant and all the liabilities thereto. She had pluck enough to endure unto the end without murmuring. The martyrs in olden times who dwelt in &quot;dens and caves of the earth,&quot; could hardly have fared worse than some of these way-worn travelers.</p><p>After the rest, needed by one who had suffered so severely until her arrival in Philadelphia, she was forwarded to her anxiously waiting husband in New Bedford, where she was gladly received.</p><p>From the frequent arrivals from Virginia, especially in steamers, it may be thought that no very stringent laws or regulations existed by which offenders, who might aid the Underground Rail Road, could be severely punished--that the slave-holders were lenient, indifferent and unguarded as to how this property took wings and escaped. In order to enlighten the reader with regard to this subject, it seems necessary, in this connection, to publish at least one of the many statutes from the slave laws of the South bearing directly on the aid and escape of slaves by vessels. The following enactment is given as passed by the Legislature of Virginia in 1856:</p><pre><code>THE PROTECTION OF SLAVE PROPERTY IN VIRGINIA.


A BILL PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR THE SLAVE PROPERTY OF
CITIZENS OF THIS COMMONWEALTH.


(1.) Be it enacted, by the General Assembly, that it shall not
be lawful for any vessel, of any size or description, whatever,
owned in whole, or in part, by any citizen or resident of
another State, and about to sail or steam for any port or place
in this State, for any port or place north of and beyond the
capes of Virginia, to depart from the waters of this
commonwealth, until said vessel has undergone the inspection
hereinafter provided for in this act, and received a certificate
to that effect. If any such vessel shall depart from the State
without such certificate of inspection, the captain or owner
thereof, shall forfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars,
to be recovered by any person who will sue for the same, in any
court of record in this State, in the name of the Governor of
the Commonwealth. Pending said suit, the vessel of said captain
or owner shall not leave the State until bond be given by the
captain or owner, or other person for him, payable to the
Governor, with two or three sureties satisfactory to the court,
in the penalty of one thousand dollars, for the payment of the
forfeit or fine, together with the cost and expenses incurred in
enforcing the same; and in default of such bond, the vessel
shall be held liable. Provided that nothing contained in this
section, shall apply to vessels belonging to the United States
Government, or vessels, American or foreign, bound direct to any
foreign country other than the British American Provinces.

(2.) The pilots licensed under the laws of Virginia, and while
attached to a vessel regularly employed as a pilot boat, are
hereby constituted inspectors to execute this act, so far as the
same may be applicable to the Chesapeake Bay, and the waters
tributary thereto, within the jurisdiction of this State,
together with such other inspectors as may be appointed by
virtue of this act.

(3.) The branch or license issued to a pilot according to the
provisions of the 92d chapter of Code, shall be sufficient
evidence that he is authorized and empowered to act as inspector
as aforesaid.

(4.) It shall be the duty of the inspector, or other person
authorized to act under this law, to examine and search all
vessels hereinbefore described, to see that no slave or person
held to service or labor in this State, or person charged with
the commission of any crime within the State, shall be concealed
on board said vessel. Such inspection shall be made within
twelve hours of the time of departure of such vessel from the
waters of Virginia, and may be made in any bay, river, creek, or
other water-course of the State, provided, however, that
steamers plying as regular packets, between ports in Virginia
and those north of, and outside of the capes of Virginia, shall
be inspected at the port of departure nearest Old Point Comfort.

(5.) A vessel so inspected and getting under way, with intent to
leave the waters of the State, if she returns to an anchorage
above Back River Point, or within Old Point Comfort, shall be
again inspected and charged as if an original case. If such
vessel be driven back by stress of weather to seek a harbor, she
shall be exempt from payment of a second fee, unless she holds
intercourse with the shore.

(6.) If, after searching the vessel, the inspector see no just
cause to detain her, he shall give to the captain a certificate
to that effect. If, however, upon such inspection, or in any
other manner, any slave or person held to service or labor, or
any person charged with any crime, be found on board of any
vessel whatever, for the purpose aforesaid, or said vessel be
detected in the act of leaving this commonwealth with any such
slave or person on board, or otherwise violating the provisions
of this act, he shall attach said vessel, and arrest all persons
on board, to be delivered up to the sergeant or sheriff of the
nearest port in this commonwealth, to be dealt with according to
law.

(7.) If any inspector or other officer be opposed, or shall have
reason to suspect that he will be opposed or obstructed in the
discharge of any duty required of him under this act, he shall
have power to summon and command the force of any county or
corporation to aid him in the discharge of such duty, and every
person who shall resist, obstruct, or refuse to aid any
inspector or other officer in the discharge of such duty, shall
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be fined and imprisoned as in other cases of misdemeanor.

(8.) For every inspection of a vessel under this law, the
inspector, or other officer shall be entitled to demand and
receive the sum of five dollars; for the payment of which such
vessel shall be liable, and the inspector or other officer may
seize and hold her until the same is paid, together with all
charges incurred in taking care of the vessel, as well as in
enforcing the payment of the same. Provided, that steam packets
trading regularly between the waters of Virginia and ports north
of and beyond the capes of Virginia, shall pay not more than
five dollars for each inspection under the provisions of this
act; provided, however, that for every inspection of a vessel
engaged in the coal trade, the inspector shall not receive a
greater sum than two dollars.

(9.) Any inspector or other person apprehending a slave in the
act of escaping from the state, on board a vessel trading to or
belonging to a non-slave-holding state, or who shall give
information that will lead to the recovery of any slave, as
aforesaid, shall be entitled to a reward of One Hundred Dollars,
to be paid by the owner of such slave, or by the fiduciary
having charge of the estate to which such slave belongs; and if
the vessel be forfeited under the provisions of this act, he
shall be entitled to one-half of the proceeds arising from the
sale of the vessel; and if the same amounts to one hundred
dollars, he shall not receive from the owner the above reward of
one hundred dollars.

(10.) An inspector permitting a slave to escape for the want of
proper exertion, or by neglect in the discharge of his duty,
shall be fined One Hundred Dollars; or if for like causes he
permit a vessel, which the law requires him to inspect, to leave
the state without inspection, he shall be fined not less than
twenty, nor more than fifty dollars, to be recovered by warrant
by any person who will proceed against him.

(11.) No pilot acting under the authority of the laws of the
state, shall pilot out of the jurisdiction of this state any
such vessel as is described in this act, which has not obtained
and exhibited to him the certificate of inspection hereby
required; and if any pilot shall so offend, he shall forfeit and
pay not less than twenty, or more than fifty dollars, to be
recovered in the mode prescribed in the next preceding section
of this act.

(12.) The courts of the several counties or corporations
situated on the Chesapeake Bay, or its tributaries, by an order
entered on record, may appoint one or more inspectors, at such
place or places within their respective districts as they may
deem necessary, to prevent the escape or for the recapture of
slaves attempting to escape beyond the limits of the state, and
to search or otherwise examine all vessels trading to such
counties or corporations. The expenses in such cases to be
provided for by a levy on negroes now taxed by law; but no
inspection by county or corporation officers thus appointed,
shall supersede the inspection of such vessels by pilots and
other inspectors, as specially provided for in this act.

(13.) It shall be lawful for the county court of any county,
upon the application of five or more slave-holders, residents of
the counties where the application is made, by an order of
record, to designate one or more police stations in their
respective counties, and a captain and three or more other
persons as a police patrol on each station, for the recapture of
fugitive slaves; which patrol shall be in service at such times,
and such stations as the court shall direct by their order
aforesaid; and the said court shall allow a reasonable
compensation, to be paid to the members of such patrol; and for
that purpose, the said court may from time to time direct a levy
on negroes now taxed by law, at such rate per capita as the
court may think sufficient, to be collected and accounted for by
the sheriff as other county levies, and to be called, &quot;The
fugitive slave tax.&quot; The owner of each fugitive slave in the act
of escaping beyond the limits of the commonwealth, to a
non-slave-holding state, and captured by the patrol aforesaid,
shall pay for each slave over fifteen, and under forty-five
years old, a reward of One Hundred dollars; for each slave over
five, and under fifteen years old, the sum of sixty dollars; and
for all others, the sum of forty dollars. Which reward shall be
divided equally among the members of the patrol retaking the
slave and actually on duty at the time; and to secure the
payment of said reward, the said patrol may retain possession
and use of the slave until the reward is paid or secured to
them.

(14.) The executive of this State may appoint one or more
inspectors for the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, if he shall
deem it expedient, for the due execution of this act. The
inspectors so appointed to perform the same duties, and to be
invested with the same powers in their respective districts, and
receive the same fees, as pilots acting as inspectors in other
parts of the State. A vessel subject to inspection under this
law, departing from any of the above-named counties or rivers on
her voyage to sea, shall be exempted from the payment of a fee
for a second inspection by another officer, if provided with a
certificate from the proper inspecting officer of that district;
but if, after proceeding on her voyage, she returns to the port
or place of departure, or enters any other port, river, or
roadstead in the State, the said vessel shall be again
inspected, and pay a fee of five dollars, as if she had
undergone no previous examination and received no previous
certificate.

If driven by stress of weather to seek a harbor, and she has no
intercourse with the shore, then, and in that case, no second
fee shall be paid by said vessel.

(15.) For the better execution of the provisions of this act, in
regard to the inspection, of vessels, the executive is hereby
authorized and directed to appoint a chief inspector, to reside
at Norfolk, whose duty it shall be, to direct and superintend
the police, agents, or inspectors above referred to. He shall
keep a record of all vessels engaged in the piloting business,
together with a list of such persons as may be employed as
pilots and inspectors under this law. The owner or owners of
each boat shall make a monthly report to him, of all vessels
inspected by persons attached to said pilot boats, the names of
such vessels, the owner or owners thereof, and the places where
owned or licensed, and where trading to or from, and the
business in which they are engaged, together with a list of
their crews. Any inspector failing to make his report to the
chief inspector, shall pay a fine of twenty dollars for each
such failure, which fine shall be recovered by warrant, before a
justice of the county or corporation. The chief inspector may
direct the time and station for the cruise of each pilot boat,
and perform such other duty as the Governor may designate, not
inconsistent with the other provisions of this act. He shall
make a quarterly return to the executive of all the transactions
of his department, reporting to him any failure or refusal on
the part of inspectors to discharge the duty assigned to them,
and the Governor, for sufficient cause, may suspend or remove
from office any delinquent inspector. The chief inspector shall
receive as his compensation, ten per cent, on all the fees and
fines received by the inspectors acting under his authority, and
may be removed at the pleasure of the executive.

(16.) All fees and forfeitures imposed by this act, and not
otherwise specially provided for, shall go one half to the
informer, and the other be paid into the treasury of the State,
to constitute a fund, to be called the &quot;fugitive slave fund,&quot;
and to be used for the payment of rewards awarded by the
Governor, for the apprehension of runaway slaves, and to pay
other expenses incident to the execution of this law, together
with such other purposes as may hereafter be determined on by
the General Assembly.

(17.) This act shall be in force from its passage.

JAMES NOBLE,

m26-3t.

No. 153 Broadway, Baltimore.
</code></pre><p>Lear Green, so particularly advertised in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; by &quot;James Noble,&quot; won for herself a strong claim to a high place among the heroic women of the nineteenth century. In regard to description and age the advertisement is tolerably accurate, although her master might have added, that her countenance was one of peculiar modesty and grace. Instead of being &quot;black,&quot; she was of a &quot;dark-brown color.&quot; Of her bondage she made the following statement: She was owned by &quot;James Noble, a Butter Dealer&quot; of Baltimore. He fell heir to Lear by the will of his wife&#39;s mother, Mrs. Rachel Howard, by whom she had previously been owned. Lear was but a mere child when she came into the hands of Noble&#39;s family. She, therefore, remembered but little of her old mistress. Her young mistress, however, had made a lasting impression upon her mind; for she was very exacting and oppressive in regard to the tasks she was daily in the habit of laying upon Lear&#39;s shoulders, with no disposition whatever to allow her any liberties. At least Lear was never indulged in this respect. In this situation a young man by the name of William Adams proposed marriage to her. This offer she was inclined to accept, but disliked the idea of being encumbered with the chains of slavery and the duties of a family at the same time.</p><p>After a full consultation with her mother and also her intended upon the matter, she decided that she must be free in order to fill the station of a wife and mother. For a time dangers and difficulties in the way of escape seemed utterly to set at defiance all hope of success. Whilst every pulse was beating strong for liberty, only one chance seemed to be left, the trial of which required as much courage as it would to endure the cutting off the right arm or plucking out the right eye. An old chest of substantial make, such as sailors commonly use, was procured. A quilt, a pillow, and a few articles of raiment, with a small quantity of food and a bottle of water were put in it, and Lear placed therein; strong ropes were fastened around the chest and she was safely stowed amongst the ordinary freight on one of the Erricson line of steamers. Her intended&#39;s mother, who was a free woman, agreed to come as a passenger on the same boat. How could she refuse? The prescribed rules of the Company assigned colored passengers to the deck. In this instance it was exactly where this guardian and mother desired to be--as near the chest as possible. Once or twice, during the silent watches of the night, she was drawn irresistibly to the chest, and could not refrain from venturing to untie the rope and raise the lid a little, to see if the poor child still lived, and at the same time to give her a breath of fresh air. Without uttering a whisper, that frightful moment, this office was successfully performed. That the silent prayers of this oppressed young woman, together with her faithful protector&#39;s, were momentarily ascending to the ear of the good God above, there can be no question. Nor is it to be doubted for a moment but that some ministering angel aided the mother to unfasten the rope, and at the same time nerved the heart of poor Lear to endure the trying ordeal of her perilous situation. She declared that she had no fear.</p><p>After she had passed eighteen hours in the chest, the steamer arrived at the wharf in Philadelphia, and in due time the living freight was brought off the boat, and at first was delivered at a house in Barley street, occupied by particular friends of the mother. Subsequently chest and freight were removed to the residence of the writer, in whose family she remained several days under the protection and care of the Vigilance Committee.</p><p>[Illustration: ]</p><p>Such hungering and thirsting for liberty, as was evinced by Lear Green, made the efforts of the most ardent friends, who were in the habit of aiding fugitives, seem feeble in the extreme. Of all the heroes in Canada, or out of it, who have purchased their liberty by downright bravery, through perils the most hazardous, none deserve more praise than Lear Green.</p><p>She remained for a time in this family, and was then forwarded to Elmira. In this place she was married to William Adams, who has been previously alluded to. They never went to Canada, but took up their permanent abode in Elmira. The brief space of about three years only was allotted her in which to enjoy freedom, as death came and terminated her career. About the time of this sad occurrence, her mother-in-law died in this city. The impressions made by both mother and daughter can never be effaced. The chest in which Lear escaped has been preserved by the writer as a rare trophy, and her photograph taken, while in the chest, is an excellent likeness of her and, at the same time, a fitting memorial.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>ISAAC WILLIAMS, HENRY BANKS, AND KIT NICKLESS.</p><p>MONTHS IN A CAVE,--SHOT BY SLAVE-HUNTERS.</p><p>Rarely were three travelers from the house of bondage received at the Philadelphia station whose narratives were more interesting than those of the above-named individuals. Before escaping they had encountered difficulties of the most trying nature. No better material for dramatic effect could be found than might have been gathered from the incidents of their lives and travels. But all that we can venture to introduce here is the brief account recorded at the time of their sojourn at the Philadelphia station when on their way to Canada in 1854. The three journeyed together. They had been slaves together in the same neighborhood. Two of them had shared the same den and cave in the woods, and had been shot, captured, and confined in the same prison; had broken out of prison and again escaped; consequently their hearts were thoroughly cemented in the hope of reaching freedom together.</p><p>Isaac was a stout-made young man, about twenty-six years of age, possessing a good degree of physical and mental ability. Indeed his intelligence forbade his submission to the requirements of Slavery, rendered him unhappy and led him to seek his freedom. He owed services to D. Fitchhugh up to within a short time before he escaped. Against Fitchhugh he made grave charges, said that he was a &quot;hard, bad man.&quot; It is but fair to add that Isaac was similarly regarded by his master, so both were dissatisfied with each other. But the master had the advantage of Isaac, he could sell him. Isaac, however, could turn the table on his master, by running off. But the master moved quickly and sold Isaac to Dr. James, a negro trader. The trader designed making a good speculation out of his investment: Isaac determined that he should be disappointed; indeed that he should lose every dollar that he paid for him. So while the doctor was planning where and how he could get the best price for him, Isaac was planning how and where he might safely get beyond his reach. The time for planning and acting with Isaac was, however, exceedingly short. He was daily expecting to be called upon to take his departure for the South. In this situation he made known his condition to a friend of his who was in a precisely similar situation; had lately been sold just as Isaac had to the same trader James. So no argument was needed to convince his friend and fellow-servant that if they meant to be free they would have to set off immediately.</p><p>That night Henry Banks and Isaac Williams started for the woods together, preferring to live among reptiles and wild animals, rather than be any longer at the disposal of Dr. James. For two weeks they successfully escaped their pursuers. The woods, however, were being hunted in every direction, and one day the pursuers came upon them, shot them both, and carried them to King George&#39;s Co. jail. The jail being an old building had weak places in it; but the prisoners concluded to make no attempt to break out while suffering badly from their wounds. So they remained one month in confinement. All the while their brave spirits under suffering grew more and more daring. Again they decided to strike for freedom, but where to go, save to the woods, they had not the slightest idea. Of course they had heard, as most slaves had, of cave life, and pretty well understood all the measures which had to be resorted to for security when entering upon so hazardous an undertaking. They concluded, however, that they could not make their condition any worse, let circumstances be what they might in this respect. Having discovered how they could break jail, they were not long in accomplishing their purpose, and were out and off to the woods again. This time they went far into the forest, and there they dug a cave, and with great pains had every thing so completely arranged as to conceal the spot entirely. In this den they stayed three months. Now and then they would manage to secure a pig. A friend also would occasionally serve them with a meal. Their sufferings at best were fearful; but great as they were, the thought of returning to Slavery never occurred to them, and the longer they stayed in the woods, the greater was their determination to be free. In the belief that their owner had about given them up they resolved to take the North Star for a pilot, and try in this way to reach free land.</p><p>Kit, an old friend in time of need, having proved true to them in their cave, was consulted. He fully appreciated their heroism, and determined that he would join them in the undertaking, as he was badly treated by his master, who was called General Washington, a common farmer, hard drinker, and brutal fighter, which Kit&#39;s poor back fully evinced by the marks it bore. Of course Isaac and Henry were only too willing to have him accompany them.</p><p>In leaving their respective homes they broke kindred ties of the tenderest nature. Isaac had a wife, Eliza, and three children, Isaac, Estella, and Ellen, all owned by Fitchhugh. Henry was only nineteen, single, but left parents, brothers, and sisters, all owned by different slave-holders. Kit had a wife, Matilda, and three children, Sarah Ann, Jane Frances, and Ellen, slaves.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

He used Uncle Sam&#39;s mail, and his own name, with as much freedom as though he had been President of the Pennsylvania Central Rail Road, instead of only a conductor and stock-holder on the Underground Rail Road.</p><pre><code>9 mo. 26th, 1856.

RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL, I send on to thy care this
evening by Rail Road, 5 able-bodied men, on their way North;
receive them as the Good Samaritan of old and oblige thy friend,
THOMAS GARRETT.
</code></pre><p>The &quot;able-bodied men&quot; duly arrived, and were thus recorded on the Underground Rail Road books as trophies of the success of the friends of humanity.</p><p>Cyrus is twenty-six years of age, stout, and unmistakably dark, and was owned by James K. Lewis, a store-keeper, and a &quot;hard master.&quot; He kept slaves for the express purpose of hiring them out, and it seemed to afford him as much pleasure to receive the hard-earned dollars of his bondmen as if he had labored for them with his own hands. &quot;It mattered not, how mean a man might be,&quot; if he would pay the largest price, he was the man whom the store-keeper preferred to hire to. This always caused Cyrus to dislike him. Latterly he had been talking of moving into the State of Virginia. Cyrus disliked this talk exceedingly, but he &quot;said nothing to the white people&quot; touching the matter. However, he was not long in deciding that such a move would be of no advantage to him; indeed, he had an idea if all was true that he had heard about that place, he would be still more miserable there, than he had ever been under his present owner. At once, he decided that he would move towards Canada, and that he would be fixed in his new home before his master got off to Virginia, unless he moved sooner than Cyrus expected him to do. Those nearest of kin, to whom he felt most tenderly allied, and from whom he felt that it would be hard to part, were his father and mother. He, however, decided that he should have to leave them. Freedom, he felt, was even worth the giving up of parents.</p><p>Believing that company was desirable, he took occasion to submit his plan to certain friends, who were at once pleased with the idea of a trip on the Underground Rail Road, to Canada, etc; and all agreed to join him. At first, they traveled on foot; of their subsequent travel, mention has already been made in friend Garrett&#39;s epistle.</p><p>Joshua is about twenty-seven years of age, quite stout, brown color, and would pass for an intelligent farm hand. He was satisfied never to wear the yoke again that some one else might reap the benefit of his toil. His master, Isaac Harris, he denounced as a &quot;drunkard.&quot; His chief excuse for escaping, was because Harris had &quot;sold&quot; his &quot;only brother.&quot; He was obliged to leave his father and mother in the hands of his master.</p><p>Charles is twenty-two years of age, also stout, and well-made, and apparently possessed all the qualifications for doing a good day&#39;s work on a farm. He was held to service by Mrs. Mary Hurley. Charles gave no glowing account of happiness and comfort under the rule of the female sex, indeed, he was positive in saying that he had &quot;been used rough.&quot; During the present year, he was sold for $1200.</p><p>Ephraim is twenty-two years of age, stout and athletic, one who appears in every way fitted for manual labor or anything else that he might be privileged to learn. John Campbell Henry, was the name of the man whom he had been taught to address as master, and for whose benefit he had been compelled to labor up to the day he &quot;took out.&quot; In considering what he had been in Maryland and how he had been treated all his life, he alleged that John Campbell Henry was a &quot;bad man.&quot; Not only had Ephraim been treated badly by his master but he had been hired out to a man no better than his master, if as good. Ephraim left his mother and six brothers and sisters.</p><p>Francis is twenty-one, an able-bodied &quot;article,&quot; of dark color, and was owned by James A. Waddell. All that he could say of his owner, was, that he was a &quot;hard master,&quot; from whom he was very glad to escape.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

Anthony and Albert Brown.</p><p>Arrival 12th. George Williams and Charles Holladay.</p><p>Arrival 13th. William Govan.</p><p>While none in this catalogue belonged to the class whose daring adventures rendered their narratives marvellous, nevertheless they represented a very large number of those who were continually on the alert to get rid of their captivity. And in all their efforts in this direction they manifested a marked willingness to encounter perils either by land or water, by day or by night, to obtain their God-given rights. Doubtless, even among these names, will be found those who have been supposed to be lost, and mysteries will be disclosed which have puzzled scores of relatives longing and looking many years in vain to ascertain the whereabouts of this or that companion, brother, sister, or friend. So, if impelled by no other consideration than the hope of consoling this class of anxious inquirers, this is a sufficient justification for not omitting them entirely, notwithstanding the risk of seeming to render these pages monotonous.</p><p>Arrival No. 1. First on this record was a young mulatto woman, twenty-nine years of age--orange color, who could read and write very well, and was unusually intelligent and withal quite handsome. She was known by the name of Frances Hilliard, and escaped from Richmond, Va., where she was owned by Beverly Blair. The owner hired her out to a man by the name of Green, from whom he received seventy dollars per annum. Green allowed her to hire herself for the same amount, with the understanding that Frances should find all her own clothes, board herself and find her own house to live in. Her husband, who was also a slave, had fled nearly one year previous, leaving her widowed, of course. Notwithstanding the above mentioned conditions, under which she had the privilege of living, Frances said that she &quot;had been used well.&quot; She had been sold four times in her life. In the first instance the failure of her master was given as the reason of her sale. Subsequently she was purchased and sold by different traders, who designed to speculate upon her as a &quot;fancy article.&quot; They would dress her very elegantly, in order to show her off to the best advantage possible, but it appears that she had too much regard for her husband and her honor, to consent to fill the positions which had been basely assigned her by her owners.</p><p>Frances assisted her husband to escape from his owner--Taits--and was never contented until she succeeded in following him to Canada. In escaping, she left her mother, Sarah Corbin, and her sister, Maria. On reaching the Vigilance Committee she learned all about her husband. She was conveyed from Richmond secreted on a steamer under the care of one of the colored hands on the boat. From here she was forwarded to Canada at the expense of the Committee. Arriving in Toronto, and not finding her hopes fully realized, with regard to meeting her husband, she wrote back the following letter:</p><pre><code>TORONTO, CANADA, U.C., October 15th, 1855.

MY DEAR MR. STILL:--Sir--I take the opportunity of writing you a
few lines to inform you of my health. I am very well at present,
and hope that when these few lines reach you they may find you
enjoying the same blessing. Give my love to Mrs. Still and all
the children, and also to Mr. Swan, and tell him that he must
give you the money that he has, and you will please send it to
me, as I have received a letter from my husband saying that I
must come on to him as soon as I get the money from him. I
cannot go to him until I get the money that Mr. Swan has in
hand. Please tell Mr. Caustle that the clothes he spoke of my
mother did not know anything about them. I left them with Hinson
Brown and he promised to give them to Mr. Smith. Tell him to ask
Mr. Smith to get them from Mr. Brown for me, and when I get
settled I will send him word and he can send them to me. The
letters that were sent to me I received them all. I wish you
would send me word if Mr. Smith is on the boat yet--if he is
please write me word in your next letter. Please send me the
money as soon as you possibly can, for I am very anxious to see
my husband. I send to you for I think you will do what you can
for me. No more at present, but remain Yours truly,

FRANCES HILLIARD.

Send me word if Mr. Caustle had given Mr. Smith the money that
he promised to give him.
</code></pre><p>For one who had to steal the art of reading and writing, her letter bears studying.</p><p>Arrival No. 2. Louisa Harding, alias Rebecca Hall. Louisa was a mulatto girl, seventeen years of age. She reported herself from Baltimore, where she had been owned by lawyer Magill. It might be said that she also possessed great personal attractions as an &quot;article&quot; of much value in the eye of a trader. All the near kin whom she named as having left behind, consisted of a mother and a brother.</p><p>Arrival No. 3. John Mackintosh. John&#39;s history is short. He represented himself as having arrived from Darien, Georgia, where he had seen &quot;hard times.&quot; Age, forty-four. This is all that was recorded of John, except the expenses met by the Committee.</p><p>Arrival No. 4. Maria Jane Houston. The little State of Delaware lost in the person of Maria, one of her nicest-looking bond-maids. She had just arrived at the age of twenty-one, and felt that she had already been sufficiently wronged. She was a tall, dark, young woman, from the neighborhood of Cantwell&#39;s Bridge. Although she had no horrible tales of suffering to relate, the Committee regarded her as well worthy of aid.</p><p>Arrival No. 5. Miles Hooper. This subject came from North Carolina; he was owned by George Montigue, who lived at Federal Mills, was a decided opponent to the no-pay system, to flogging, and selling likewise. In fact nothing that was auxiliary to Slavery was relished by him. Consequently he concluded to leave the place altogether. At the time that Miles took this stand he was twenty-three years of age, a dark-complexioned man, rather under the medium height, physically, but a full-grown man mentally. &quot;My owner was a hard man,&quot; said Miles, in speaking of his characteristics. His parents, brothers, and sisters were living, at least he had reason to believe so, although they were widely scattered.</p><p>Arrival No. 6. Samuel Miles, alias Robert King. Samuel was a representative of Revel&#39;s Neck, Somerset Co., Md. His master he regarded as a &quot;very fractious man, hard to please.&quot; The cause of the trouble or unpleasantness, which resulted in Samuel&#39;s Underground adventure, was traceable to his master&#39;s refusal to allow him to visit his wife. Not only was Samuel denied this privilege, but he was equally denied all privileges. His master probably thought that Sam had no mind, nor any need of a wife. Whether this was really so or not, Sam was shrewd enough to &quot;leave his old master with the bag to hold,&quot; which was sensible. Thirty-one years of Samuel&#39;s life were passed in Slavery, ere he escaped. The remainder of his days he felt bound to have the benefit of himself. In leaving home he had to part with his wife and one child, Sarah and little Henry, who were fortunately free.</p><p>On arriving in Canada Samuel wrote back for his wife, &amp;c., as follows:</p><pre><code>ST. CATHARINES, C.W., Aug. 20th, 1855.

her to address as soon as she hears from me. Inform her that I
now stop in St. Catharines near the Niagara Falls that I am not
yet in business but expect to get into business very soon--That
I am in the enjoyment of good health and hoping that this
communication may find my affectionate wife the same. That I
have been highly favored with friends throughout my journey I
wish my wife to write to me as soon as she can and let me know
how soon I may expect to see her on this side of the Niagara
River. My wife had better call on Dr. Perkins and perhaps he
will let her have the money he had in charge for me but that I
failed of receiving when I left Baltimore. Please direct the
letter for my wife to Mr. George Lister, in Hill street between
Howard and Sharp. My compliments to all enquiring friends.

Very respectfully yours,

SAMUEL MILES.

P.S. Please send the thread along as a token and my wife will
understand that all is right. S.M.
</code></pre><p>Arrival No. 7. James Henson, alias David Caldwell. James fled from Cecil Co., Md. He claimed that he was entitled to his freedom according to law at the age of twenty-eight, but had been unjustly deprived of it. Having waited in vain for his free papers for four years, he suspected that he was to be dealt with in a manner similar to many others, who had been willed free or who had bought their time, and had been shamefully cheated out of their freedom. So in his judgment he felt that his only hope lay in making his escape on the Underground Rail Road. He had no faith whatever in the man who held him in bondage, Jacob Johnson, but no other charges of ill treatment, &amp;c., have been found against said Johnson on the books, save those alluded to above.</p><p>James was thirty-two years of age, stout and well proportioned, with more than average intelligence and resolution. He left a wife and child, both free.</p><p>Arrival No. 8. Laura Lewis. Laura arrived from Louisville, Kentucky. She had been owned by a widow woman named Lewis, but as lately as the previous March her mistress died, leaving her slaves and other property to be divided among her heirs. As this would necessitate a sale of the slaves, Laura determined not to be on hand when the selling day came, so she took time by the forelock and left. Her appearance indicated that she had been among the more favored class of slaves. She was about twenty-five years of age, quite stout, of mixed blood, and intelligent, having traveled considerably with her mistress. She had been North in this capacity. She left her mother, one brother, and one sister in Louisville.</p><p>Arrival No. 9. Elizabeth Banks, from near Easton, Maryland. Her lot had been that of an ordinary slave. Of her slave-life nothing of interest was recorded. She had escaped from her owner two and a half years prior to coming into the hands of the Committee, and had been living in Pennsylvania pretty securely as she had supposed, but she had been awakened to a sense of her danger by well grounded reports that she was pursued by her claimant, and would be likely to be captured if she tarried short of Canada. With such facts staring her in the face she was sent to the Committee for counsel and protection, and by them she was forwarded on in the usual way. She was about twenty-five years of age, of a dark, and spare structure.</p><p>Arrival No. 10. Simon Hill. This fugitive had escaped from Virginia. The usual examination was made, and needed help given him by the Committee who felt satisfied that he was a poor brother who had been shamefully wronged, and that he richly deserved sympathy. He was aided and directed Canada-ward. He was a very humble-looking specimen of the peculiar institution, about twenty-five years of age, medium size, and of a dark hue.</p><p>Arrival No. 11. Anthony and Albert Brown (brothers), Jones Anderson and Isaiah.</p><p>This party escaped from Tanner&#39;s Creek, Norfolk, Virginia, where they had been owned by John and Henry Holland, oystermen. As slaves they alleged that they had been subjected to very brutal treatment from their profane and ill-natured owners. Not relishing this treatment, Albert and Anthony came to the conclusion that they understood boating well enough to escape by water. They accordingly selected one of their master&#39;s small oyster-boats, which was pretty-well rigged with sails, and off they started for a Northern Shore. They proceeded on a part of their voyage merely by guess work, but landed safely, however, about twenty-five miles north of Baltimore, though, by no means, on free soil. They had no knowledge of the danger that they were then in, but they were persevering, and still determined to make their way North, and thus, at last, success attended their efforts. Their struggles and exertions having been attended with more of the romantic and tragical elements than had characterized the undertakings of any of the other late passengers, the Committee felt inclined to make a fuller notice of them on the book, yet failed to do them justice in this respect.</p><p>The elder brother was twenty-nine, the younger twenty-seven. Both were mentally above the average run of slaves. They left wives in Norfolk, named Alexenia and Ellen. While Anthony and Albert, in seeking their freedom, were forced to sever their connections with their companions, they did not forget them in Canada.</p><p>How great was their delight in freedom, and tender their regard for their wives, and the deep interest they felt for their brethren and friends generally, may be seen from a perusal of the following letters from them:</p><pre><code>HAMELTON, March 7th 1856.

</code></pre><p>Arrival No. 12. George Williams and Charles Holladay. These two travelers were about the same age. They were not, however, from the same neighborhood--they happened to meet each other as they were traveling the road. George fled from St. Louis, Charles from Baltimore. George &quot;owed service&quot; to Isaac Hill, a planter; he found no special fault with his master&#39;s treatment of him; but with Mrs. Hill, touching this point, he was thoroughly dissatisfied. She had treated him &quot;cruelly,&quot; and it was for this reason that he was moved to seek his freedom.</p><p>Charles, being a Baltimorean, had not far to travel, but had pretty sharp hunters to elude.</p><p>His claimant, F. Smith, however, had only a term of years claim upon him, which was within about two years of being out. This contract for the term of years, Charles felt was made without consulting him, therefore he resolved to break it without consulting his master. He also declined to have anything to do with the Baltimore and Wilmington R.R. Co., considering it a prescriptive institution, not worthy of his confidence. He started on a fast walk, keeping his eyes wide open, looking out for slave-hunters on his right and left. In this way, like many others, he reached the Committee safely and was freely aided, thenceforth traveling in a first class Underground Rail Road car, till he reached his journey&#39;s end.</p><p>Arrival No. 13. William Govan. Availing himself of a passage on the schooner of Captain B., William left Petersburg, where he had been owned by &quot;Mark Davis, Esq., a retired gentleman,&quot; rather, a retired negro trader.</p><p>William was about thirty-three years of age, and was of a bright orange color. Nothing but an ardent love of liberty prompted him to escape. He was quite smart, and a clever-looking man, worth at least $1,000.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>DEEP FURROWS ON THE BACK.</p><p>THOMAS MADDEN.</p><p>Of all the passengers who had hitherto arrived with bruised and mangled bodies received at the hands of slave-holders, none brought a back so shamefully lacerated by the lash as Thomas Madden. Not a single spot had been exempted from the excoriating cow-hide. A most bloody picture did the broad back and shoulders of Thomas present to the eye as he bared his wounds for inspection. While it was sad to think, that millions of men, women, and children throughout the South were liable to just such brutal outrages as Thomas had received, it was a satisfaction to think, that this outrage had made a freeman of him.</p><p>He was only twenty-two years of age, but that punishment convinced him that he was fully old enough to leave such a master as E. Ray, who had almost murdered him. But for this treatment, Thomas might have remained in some degree contented in Slavery. He was expected to look after the fires in the house on Sunday mornings. In a single instance desiring to be absent, perhaps for his own pleasure, two boys offered to be his substitute. The services of the boys were accepted, and this gave offence to the master. This Thomas declared was the head and front of his offending. His simple narration of the circumstances of his slave life was listened to by the Committee with deep interest and a painful sense of the situation of slaves under the despotism of such men as Ray.</p><p>After being cared for by the Committee he was sent on to Canada. When there he wrote back to let the Committee know how he was faring, the narrow escape he had on the way, and likewise to convey the fact, that one named &quot;Rachel,&quot; left behind, shared a large place in his affections. The subjoined letter is the only correspondence of his preserved:</p><pre><code>STANFORD, June 1st, 1855, Niagara districk.

</code></pre><p>&quot;PETE MATTHEWS,&quot; ALIAS SAMUEL SPARROWS.</p><p>&quot;I MIGHT AS WELL BE IN THE PENITENTIARY, &amp;C.&quot;</p><p>Up to the age of thirty-five &quot;Pete&quot; had worn the yoke steadily, if not patiently under William S. Matthews, of Oak Hall, near Temperanceville, in the State of Virginia. Pete said that his &quot;master was not a hard man,&quot; but the man to whom he &quot;was hired, George Matthews, was a very cruel man.&quot; &quot;I might as well be in the penitentiary as in his hands,&quot; was his declaration.</p><p>One day, a short while before Pete &quot;took out,&quot; an ox broke into the truck patch, and helped himself to choice delicacies, to the full extent of his capacious stomach, making sad havoc with the vegetables generally. Peter&#39;s attention being directed to the ox, he turned him out, and gave him what he considered proper chastisement, according to the mischief he had done. At this liberty taken by Pete, the master became furious. &quot;He got his gun and threatened to shoot him,&quot; &quot;Open your mouth if you dare, and I will pat the whole load into you,&quot; said the enraged master. &quot;He took out a large dirk-knife, and attempted to stab me, but I kept out of his way,&quot; said Pete. Nevertheless the violence of the master did not abate until he had beaten Pete over the head and body till he was weary, inflicting severe injuries. A great change was at once wrought in Pete&#39;s mind. He was now ready to adopt any plan that might hold out the least encouragement to escape. Having capital to the amount of four dollars only, he felt that he could not do much towards employing a conductor, but he had a good pair of legs, and a heart stout enough to whip two or three slave-catchers, with the help of a pistol. Happening to know a man who had a pistol for sale, he went to him and told him that he wished to purchase it. For one dollar the pistol became Pete&#39;s property. He had but three dollars left, but he was determined to make that amount answer his purposes under the circumstances. The last cruel beating maddened him almost to desperation, especially when he remembered how he had been compelled to work hard night and day, under Matthews. Then, too, Peter had a wife, whom his master prevented him from visiting; this was not among the least offences with which Pete charged his master. Fully bent on leaving, the following Sunday was fixed by him on which to commence his journey.</p><p>The time arrived and Pete bade farewell to Slavery, resolved to follow the North Star, with his pistol in hand ready for action. After traveling about two hundred miles from home he unexpectedly had an opportunity of using his pistol. To his astonishment he suddenly came face to face with a former master, whom he had not seen for a long time. Pete desired no friendly intercourse with him whatever; but he perceived that his old master recognized him and was bent upon stopping him. Pete held on to his pistol, but moved as fast as his wearied limbs would allow him, in an opposite direction. As he was running, Pete cautiously, cast his eye over his shoulder, to see what had become of his old master, when to his amazement, he found that a regular chase was being made after him. Need of redoubling his pace was quite obvious. In this hour of peril, Pete&#39;s legs saved him.</p><p>After this signal leg-victory, Pete had more confidence in his &quot;understandings,&quot; than he had in his old pistol, although he held on to it until he reached Philadelphia, where he left it in the possession of the Secretary of the Committee. Considering it worth saving simply as a relic of the Underground Rail Road, it was carefully laid aside. Pete was now christened Samuel Sparrows. Mr. Sparrows had the rust of Slavery washed off as clean as possible and the Committee furnishing him with clean clothes, a ticket, and letters of introduction, started him on Canada-ward, looking quite respectable. And doubtless he felt even more so than he looked; free air had a powerful effect on such passengers as Samuel Sparrows.</p><p>The unpleasantness which grew out of the mischief done by the ox on George Matthews&#39; farm took place the first of October, 1855. Pete may be described as a man of unmixed blood, well-made, and intelligent.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

ESTEEMED FRIEND, J. MILLER MCKIM:--We made arrangements last
night, and sent away Harriet Tubman, with six men and one woman
to Allen Agnew&#39;s, to be forwarded across the country to the
city. Harriet, and one of the men had worn their shoes off their
feet, and I gave them two dollars to help fit them out, and
directed a carriage to be hired at my expense, to take them out,
but do not yet know the expense. I now have two more from the
lowest county in Maryland, on the Peninsula, upwards of one
hundred miles. I will try to get one of our trusty colored men
to take them to-morrow morning to the Anti-slavery office. You
can then pass them on.

THOMAS GARRETT.
</code></pre><p>HARRIET TUBMAN had been their &quot;Moses,&quot; but not in the sense that Andrew Johnson was the &quot;Moses of the colored people.&quot; She had faithfully gone down into Egypt, and had delivered these six bondmen by her own heroism. Harriet was a woman of no pretensions, indeed, a more ordinary specimen of humanity could hardly be found among the most unfortunate-looking farm hands of the South. Yet, in point of courage, shrewdness and disinterested exertions to rescue her fellow-men, by making personal visits to Maryland among the slaves, she was without her equal.</p><p>Her success was wonderful. Time and again she made successful visits to Maryland on the Underground Rail Road, and would be absent for weeks, at a time, running daily risks while making preparations for herself and passengers. Great fears were entertained for her safety, but she seemed wholly devoid of personal fear. The idea of being captured by slave-hunters or slave-holders, seemed never to enter her mind. She was apparently proof against all adversaries. While she thus manifested such utter personal indifference, she was much more watchful with regard to those she was piloting. Half of her time, she had the appearance of one asleep, and would actually sit down by the road-side and go fast asleep when on her errands of mercy through the South, yet, she would not suffer one of her party to whimper once, about &quot;giving out and going back,&quot; however wearied they might be from hard travel day and night. She had a very short and pointed rule or law of her own, which implied death to any who talked of giving out and going back. Thus, in an emergency she would give all to understand that &quot;times were very critical and therefore no foolishness would be indulged in on the road.&quot; That several who were rather weak-kneed and faint-hearted were greatly invigorated by Harriet&#39;s blunt and positive manner and threat of extreme measures, there could be no doubt.</p><p>After having once enlisted, &quot;they had to go through or die.&quot; Of course Harriet was supreme, and her followers generally had full faith in her, and would back up any word she might utter. So when she said to them that &quot;a live runaway could do great harm by going back, but that a dead one could tell no secrets,&quot; she was sure to have obedience. Therefore, none had to die as traitors on the &quot;middle passage.&quot; It is obvious enough, however, that her success in going into Maryland as she did, was attributable to her adventurous spirit and utter disregard of consequences. Her like it is probable was never known before or since. On examining the six passengers who came by this arrival they were thus recorded:</p><p>December 29th, 1854--John is twenty years of age, chestnut color, of spare build and smart. He fled from a farmer, by the name of John Campbell Henry, who resided at Cambridge, Dorchester Co., Maryland. On being interrogated relative to the character of his master, John gave no very amiable account of him. He testified that he was a &quot;hard man&quot; and that he &quot;owned about one hundred and forty slaves and sometimes he would sell,&quot; etc. John was one of the slaves who were &quot;hired out.&quot; He &quot;desired to have the privilege of hunting his own master.&quot; His desire was not granted. Instead of meekly submitting, John felt wronged, and made this his reason for running away. This looked pretty spirited on the part of one so young as John. The Committee&#39;s respect for him was not a little increased, when they heard him express himself.</p><p>Benjamin was twenty-eight years of age, chestnut color, medium size, and shrewd. He was the so-called property of Eliza Ann Brodins, who lived near Buckstown, in Maryland. Ben did not hesitate to say, in unqualified terms, that his mistress was &quot;very devilish.&quot; He considered his charges, proved by the fact that three slaves (himself one of them) were required to work hard and fare meagerly, to support his mistress&#39; family in idleness and luxury. The Committee paid due attention to his ex parte statement, and was obliged to conclude that his argument, clothed in common and homely language, was forcible, if not eloquent, and that he was well worthy of aid. Benjamin left his parents besides one sister, Mary Ann Williamson, who wanted to come away on the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>Henry left his wife, Harriet Ann, to be known in future by the name of &quot;Sophia Brown.&quot; He was a fellow-servant of Ben&#39;s, and one of the supports of Eliza A. Brodins.</p><p>Henry was only twenty-two, but had quite an insight into matters and things going on among slaves and slave-holders generally, in country life. He was the father of two small children, whom he had to leave behind.</p><p>Peter was owned by George Wenthrop, a farmer, living near Cambridge, Md. In answer to the question, how he had been used, he said &quot;hard.&quot; Not a pleasant thought did he entertain respecting his master, save that he was no longer to demand the sweat of Peter&#39;s brow. Peter left parents, who were free; he was born before they were emancipated, consequently, he was retained in bondage.</p><p>Jane, aged twenty-two, instead of regretting that she had unadvisedly left a kind mistress and indulgent master, who had afforded her necessary comforts, affirmed that her master, &quot;Rash Jones, was the worst man in the country.&quot; The Committee were at first disposed to doubt her sweeping statement, but when they heard particularly how she had been treated, they thought Catharine had good ground for all that she said. Personal abuse and hard usage, were the common lot of poor slave girls.</p><p>Robert was thirty-five years of age, of a chestnut color, and well made. His report was similar to that of many others. He had been provided with plenty of hard drudgery--hewing of wood and drawing of water, and had hardly been treated as well as a gentleman would treat a dumb brute. His feelings, therefore, on leaving his old master and home, were those of an individual who had been unjustly in prison for a dozen years and had at last regained his liberty.</p><p>The civilization, religion, and customs under which Robert and his companions had been raised, were, he thought, &quot;very wicked.&quot; Although these travelers were all of the field-hand order, they were, nevertheless, very promising, and they anticipated better days in Canada. Good advice was proffered them on the subject of temperance, industry, education, etc. Clothing, food and money were also given them to meet their wants, and they were sent on their way rejoicing.</p><p>ESCAPED FROM &quot;A WORTHLESS SOT.&quot;</p><p>JOHN ATKINSON.</p><p>John was a prisoner of hope under James Ray, of Portsmouth, Va., whom he declared to be &quot;a worthless sot.&quot; This character was fully set forth, but the description is too disgusting for record. John was a dark mulatto, thirty-one years of age, well-formed and intelligent. For some years before escaping he had been in the habit of hiring his time for $120 per annum. Daily toiling to support his drunken and brutal master, was a hardship that John felt keenly, but was compelled to submit to up to the day of his escape.</p><p>A part of John&#39;s life he had suffered many abuses from his oppressor, and only a short while before freeing himself, the auction-block was held up before his troubled mind. This caused him to take the first daring step towards Canada,--to leave his wife, Mary, without bidding her good-bye, or saying a word to her as to his intention of fleeing.</p><p>John came as a private passenger on one of the Richmond steamers, and was indebted to the steward of the boat for his accommodations. Having been received by the Committee, he was cared for and sent on his journey Canada-ward. There he was happy, found employment and wanted for nothing but his wife and clothing left in Virginia. On these two points he wrote several times with considerable feeling.</p><p>Some slaves who hired their time in addition to the payment of their monthly hire, purchased nice clothes for themselves, which they usually valued highly, so much so, that after escaping they would not be contented until they had tried every possible scheme to secure them. They would write back continually, either to their friends in the North or South, hoping thus to procure them.</p><p>Not unfrequently the persons who rendered them assistance in the South, would be entrusted with all their effects, with the understanding, that such valuables would be forwarded to a friend or to the Committee at the earliest opportunity. The Committee strongly protested against fugitives writing back to the South (through the mails) on account of the liability of getting parties into danger, as all such letters were liable to be intercepted in order to the discovery of the names of such as aided the Underground Rail Road. To render needless this writing to the South the Committee often submitted to be taxed with demands to rescue clothing as well as wives, etc., belonging to such as had been already aided.</p><p>The following letters are fair samples of a large number which came to the Committee touching the matter of clothing, etc.:</p><pre><code>ST. CATHARINES, Sept. 4th.

DEAR SIR:--I now embrace this favorable opportunity of writing
you a few lines to inform you that I am quite well and arrived
here safe, and I hope that these few lines may find you and your
family the same. I hope you will intercede for my clothes and as
soon as they come please to send them to me, and if you have not
time, get Dr. Lundy to look out for them, and when they come be
very careful in sending them. I wish you would copy off this
letter and give it to the Steward, and tell him to give it to
Henry Lewy and tell him to give it to my wife. Brother sends his
love to you and all the family and he is overjoyed at seeing me
arrive safe, he can hardly contain himself; also he wants to see
his wife very much, and says when she comes he hopes you will
send her on as soon as possible. Jerry Williams&#39; love, together
with all of us. I had a message for Mr. Lundy, but I forgot it
when I was there. No more at present, but remain your ever
grateful and sincere friend,

JOHN ATKINSON.





ST. CATHARINES, C.W., Oct. 5th, 1854.

MR. WM. STILL:--Dear Sir--I have learned of my friend, Richmond
Bohm, that my clothes were in Philadelphia. Will you have the
kindness to see Dr. Lundy and if he has my clothes in charge, or
knows about them, for him to send them on to me immediately, as
I am in great need of them. I would like to have them put in a
small box, and the overcoat I left at your house to be put in
the box with them, to be sent to the care of my friend, Hiram
Wilson. On receipt of this letter, I desire you to write a few
lines to my wife, Mary Atkins, in the care of my friend, Henry
Lowey, stating that I am well and hearty and hoping that she is
the same. Please tell her to remember my love to her mother and
her cousin, Emelin, and her husband, and Thomas Hunter; also to
my father and mother. Please request her to write to me
immediately, for her to be of good courage, that I love her
better than ever. I would like her to come on as soon as she
can, but for her to write and let me know when she is going to
start.

Affectionately Yours,

</code></pre><p>WILLIAM BUTCHER, ALIAS WILLIAM T. MITCHELL.</p><p>&quot;HE WAS ABUSEFUL.&quot;</p><p>This passenger reported himself from Massey&#39;s Cross-Roads, near Georgetown, Maryland. William gave as his reason for being found destitute, and under the necessity of asking aid, that a man by the name of William Boyer, who followed farming, had deprived him of his hard earnings, and also claimed him as his property; and withal that he had abused him for years, and recently had &quot;threatened to sell&quot; him. This threat made his yoke too intolerable to be borne.</p><p>He here began to think and plan for the future as he had never done before. Fortunately he was possessed with more than an average amount of mother wit, and he soon comprehended the requirements of the Underground Rail Road. He saw exactly that he must have resolution and self-dependence, very decided, in order to gain the victory over Boyer. In his hour of trial his wife, Phillis, and child, John Wesley, who were free, caused him much anxiety; but his reason taught him that it was his duty to throw off the yoke at all hazards, and he acted accordingly. Of course he left behind his wife and child. The interview which the Committee held with William was quite satisfactory, and he was duly aided and regularly despatched by the name of William T. Mitchell. He was about twenty-eight years of age, of medium size, and of quite a dark hue.</p><p>&quot;WHITE ENOUGH TO PASS.&quot;</p><p>John Wesley Gibson represented himself to be not only the slave, but also the son of William Y. Day, of Taylor&#39;s Mount, Maryland. The faintest shade of colored blood was hardly discernible in this passenger. He relied wholly on his father&#39;s white blood to secure him freedom. Having resolved to serve no longer as a slave, he concluded to &quot;hold up his head and put on airs.&quot; He reached Baltimore safely without being discovered or suspected of being on the Underground Rail Road, as far as he was aware of. Here he tried for the first time to pass for white; the attempt proved a success beyond his expectation. Indeed he could but wonder how it was that he had never before hit upon such an expedient to rid himself of his unhappy lot. Although a man of only twenty-eight years of age, he was foreman of his master&#39;s farm, but he was not particularly favored in any way on this account. His master and father endeavored to hold the reins very tightly upon him. Not even allowing him the privilege of visiting around on neighboring plantations. Perhaps the master thought the family likeness was rather too discernible. John believed that on this account all privileges were denied him, and he resolved to escape. His mother, Harriet, and sister, Frances, were named as near kin whom he had left behind. John was quite smart, and looked none the worse for having so much of his master&#39;s blood in his veins. The master was alone to blame for John&#39;s escape, as he passed on his (the master&#39;s) color.</p><p>[Illustration: ]</p><p>ESCAPING WITH MASTER&#39;S CARRIAGES AND HORSES.</p><p>HARRIET SHEPHARD, AND HER FIVE CHILDREN, WITH FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS.</p><p>One morning about the first of November, in 1855, the sleepy, slave-holding neighborhood of Chestertown, Maryland, was doubtless deeply excited on learning that eleven head of slaves, four head of horses, and two carriages were missing. It is but reasonable to suppose that the first report must have produced a shock, scarcely less stunning than an earthquake. Abolitionists, emissaries, and incendiaries were farther below par than ever. It may be supposed that cursings and threatenings were breathed out by a deeply agitated community for days in succession.</p><p>Harriet Shephard, the mother of five children, for whom she felt of course a mother&#39;s love, could not bear the thought of having her offspring compelled to wear the miserable yoke of Slavery, as she had been compelled to do. By her own personal experience, Harriet could very well judge what their fate would be when reaching man and womanhood. She declared that she had never received &quot;kind treatment.&quot; It was not on this account, however, that she was prompted to escape. She was actuated by a more disinterested motive than this. She was chiefly induced to make the bold effort to save her children from having to drag the chains of Slavery as she herself had done.</p><p>Anna Maria, Edwin, Eliza Jane, Mary Ann, and John Henry were the names of the children for whom she was willing to make any sacrifice. They were young; and unable to walk, and she was penniless, and unable to hire a conveyance, even if she had known any one who would have been willing to risk the law in taking them a night&#39;s journey. So there was no hope in these directions. Her rude intellect being considered, she was entitled to a great deal of credit for seizing the horses and carriages belonging to her master, as she did it for the liberation of her children.</p><p>Knowing others at the same time, who were wanting to visit Canada, she consulted with five of this class, males and females, and they mutually decided to travel together.</p><p>It is not likely that they knew much about the roads, nevertheless they reached Wilmington, Delaware, pretty direct, and ventured up into the heart of the town in carriages, looking as innocent as if they were going to meeting to hear an old-fashioned Southern sermon--&quot;Servants, obey your masters.&quot; Of course, the distinguished travelers were immediately reported to the noted Thomas Garrett, who was accustomed to transact the affairs of the Underground Rail Road in a cool masterly way. But, on this occasion, there was but little time for deliberation, but much need of haste to meet the emergency. He at once decided, that they must immediately be separated from the horses and carriages, and got out of Wilmington as quickly as possible. With the courage and skill, so characteristic of Garrett, the fugitives, under escort, were soon on their way to Kennett Square (a hot-bed of abolitionists and stock-holders of the Underground Rail Road), which place they reached safely. It so happened, that they reached Long Wood meeting-house in the evening, at which place a fair circle had convened. Being invited, they stayed awhile in the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one of the Kennett friends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the morning and thence, by daylight, within a short distance of Kimberton, and found succor with friend Lewis, at the old headquarters of the fugitives.</p><p>[A letter may be found from Miss G.A. Lewis, on page thirty-nine, throwing much light on this arrival]. After receiving friendly aid and advice while there, they were forwarded to the Committee in Philadelphia. Here further aid was afforded them, and as danger was quite obvious, they were completely divided and disguised, so that the Committee felt that they might safely be sent on to Canada in one of the regular trains considered most private.</p><p>Considering the condition of the slave mother and her children and friends, all concerned rejoiced, that they had had the courage to use their master&#39;s horses and vehicles as they did.</p><p>EIGHT AND A HALF MONTHS SECRETED.</p><p>WASHINGTON SOMLOR, ALIAS JAMES MOORE.</p><p>But few could tell of having been eye-witnesses to outrages more revolting and disgraceful than Washington Somlor. He arrived per steamer Pennsylvania (secreted), directly from Norfolk, Virginia, in 1855. He was thirty-two years of age--a man of medium size and quite intelligent. A merchant by the name of Smith owned Washington.</p><p>Eight and a half months before escaping, Washington had been secreted in order to shun both master and auction-block. Smith believed in selling, flogging, cobbing, paddling, and all other kinds of torture, by which he could inflict punishment in order to make the slaves feel his power. He thus tyrannized over about twenty-five head.</p><p>Being naturally passionate, when in a brutal mood, he made his slaves suffer unmercifully. Said Washington, &quot;On one occasion, about two months before I was secreted, he had five of the slaves (some of them women) tied across a barrel, lashed with the cow-hide and then cobbed--this was a common practice.&quot;</p><p>Such treatment was so inhuman and so incredible, that the Committee hesitated at first to give credence to the statement, and only yielded when facts and evidences were given which seemed incontestible.</p><p>The first effort to come away was made on the steamship City of Richmond. Within sixty miles of Philadelphia, in consequence of the ice obstruction in the river, the steamer had to go back. How sad Washington felt at thus having his hopes broken to pieces may be imagined but cannot be described. Great as was his danger, when the steamer returned to Norfolk, he was safely gotten off the boat and under the eye of officers walked away. Again he was secreted in his old doleful quarters, where he waited patiently for the Spring. It came. Again the opportunity for another trial was presented, and it was seized unhesitatingly. This time, his tried faith was rewarded with success. He came through safely to the Committee&#39;s satisfaction as well as his own. The recital of his sufferings and experience had a very inspiring effect on those who had the pleasure of seeing Wash. in Philadelphia.</p><p>Although closely secreted in Norfolk, he had, through friends, some little communication with the outside world. Among other items of information which came to his ears, was a report that his master was being pressed by his creditors, and had all his slaves advertised for sale. An item still more sad also reached his ear, to the effect that his wife had been sold away to North Carolina, and thus separated from her child, two years old. The child was given as a present to a niece of the master. While this is only a meagre portion of his interesting story, it was considered at the time sufficient to identify him should the occasion ever require it. We content ourselves, therefore, simply with giving what was recorded on the book. Wash. spent a short while in Philadelphia in order to recruit, after which, he went on North, where colored men were free.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>ARTHUR FOWLER, ALIAS BENJAMIN JOHNSON.</p><p>Arthur came from Spring Hill, Maryland. Edward Fowler held Arthur in fetters and usurped authority over him as his lord and master. Arthur saw certain signs connected with his master&#39;s family which presaged to him that the day was not far distant, when somebody would have to be sold to raise money to pamper the appetites of some of the superior members of the patriarchal institution. Among these provocations were indulgence in a great deal of extravagance, and the growing up of a number of young masters and mistresses. Arthur would often look at the heirs, and the very thought of their coming into possession, would make him tremble. Nothing so affected Arthur&#39;s mind so much in moving him to make a bold stroke for freedom as these heirs.</p><p>Under his old master, the usage had been bad enough, but he feared that it would be a great deal worse under the sons and daughters. He therefore wisely concluded to avoid the impending danger by availing himself of the Underground Rail Road. After completing such arrangements as he deemed necessary, he started, making his way along pretty successfully, with the exception of a severe encounter with Jack Frost, by which his feet were badly bitten. He was not discouraged, however, but was joyful over his victory and hopeful in view of his prospects in Canada. Arthur was about thirty years of age, medium size, and of a dark color. The Committee afforded him needed assistance, and sent him off.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>SUNDRY ARRIVALS.</p><p>About the 1st of June, 1855, the following arrivals were noted in the record book:</p><p>EMORY ROBERTS, <em>alias</em> WILLIAM KEMP, Talbot Co., Maryland; DANIEL PAYNE, Richmond, Virginia; HARRIET MAYO, JOHN JUDAH, and RICHARD BRADLEY, Petersburg and Richmond; JAMES CRUMMILL, SAMUEL JONES, TOLBERT JONES, and HENRY HOWARD, Haverford Co., Maryland; LEWIS CHILDS, Richmond, DANIEL BENNETT, <em>alias</em> HENRY WASHINGTON, and wife (MARTHA,) and two children (GEORGE and a nameless babe).</p><p>The road at this time, was doing a fair business, in a quiet way. Passengers were managing to come, without having to suffer in any very violent manner, as many had been called upon to do in making similar efforts. The success attending some of these passengers was partly attributable to the intelligence of individuals, who, for years, had been planning and making preparations to effect the end in view. Besides, the favorableness of the weather tended also to make travel more pleasant than in colder seasons of the year.</p><p>While matters were thus favorable, the long stories of individual suffering and of practices and customs among young and old masters and mistresses, were listened to attentively, although the short summer nights hardly afforded sufficient opportunity for writing out details.</p><p>Emory arrived safely from Talbot county. As a slave, he had served Edward Lloyd. He gave his master the character of treating his slaves with great severity. The &quot;lash&quot; was freely used &quot;on women as well as men, old and young.&quot; In this kind of property Lloyd had invested to the extent of &quot;about five hundred head,&quot; so Emory thought. Food and clothing for this large number were dealt out very stintedly, and daily suffering was the common lot of slaves under Lloyd.</p><p>Emory was induced to leave, to avoid a terrible flogging, which had been promised him for the coming Monday. He was a married man, but exercised no greater control over his wife than over himself. She was hired on a neighboring plantation; the way did not seem open for her to accompany him, so he had to leave her behind. His mother, brothers, and sisters had to be left also. The ties of kindred usually strong in the breasts of slaves, were hard for Emory to break, but, by a firm resolution, that he would not stay on Lloyd&#39;s plantation to endure the impending flogging, he was nerved to surmount every obstacle in the way of carrying his intention into execution. He came to the Committee hungry and in want of clothing, and was aided in the usual way.</p><p>Daniel Payne. This traveler was a man who might be said to be full of years, infirm, and well-nigh used up under a Virginia task-master. But within the old man&#39;s breast a spark was burning for freedom, and he was desirous of reaching free land, on which to lay his body when life&#39;s toil ended. So the Committee sympathized with him, aided him and sent him on to Canada. He was owned by a man named M.W. Morris, of Richmond, whence he fled.</p><p>Harriet Mayo, John Judah, and Richard Bradley were the next who brought joy and victory with them.</p><p>Harriet was a tall, well-made, intelligent young woman, twenty-two years of age. She spoke with feelings of much bitterness against her master, James Cuthbert, saying that he was a &quot;very hard man,&quot; at the same time, adding that his &quot;wife was still worse.&quot; Harriet &quot;had been sold once.&quot; She admitted however, having been treated kindly a part of her life. In escaping, she had to leave her &quot;poor old mother&quot; with no hope of ever seeing her again; likewise she regretted having to leave three brothers, who kindly aided her to escape. But having her heart bent on freedom, she resolved that nothing should deter her from putting forth efforts to get out of Slavery.</p><p>John was a mulatto, of genteel address, well clothed, and looked as if he had been &quot;well fed.&quot; Miss Eliza Lambert had the honor of owning John, and was gracious enough to allow him to hire his time for one hundred and ten dollars per annum. After this sum was punctually paid, John could do what he pleased with any surplus earnings. Now, as he was fond of nice clothing, he was careful to earn a balance sufficient to gratify this love. By similar means, many slaves were seen in southern cities elegantly dressed, and, strangers and travelers from the North gave all the credit to &quot;indulgent masters,&quot; not knowing the facts in the case.</p><p>John accused his mistress of being hard in money matters, not caring how the servants fared, so she got &quot;plenty of money out of them.&quot; For himself, however, he admitted that he had never experienced as great abuses as many had. He was fortunate in being wedded to a free wife, who was privy to all his plans and schemes looking forth to freedom, and fully acquiesced in the arrangement of matters, promising to come on after he should reach Canada. This promise was carried out in due time, and they were joyfully re-united under the protection of the British Lion.</p><p>Richard was about twenty-seven. For years the hope of freedom had occupied his thoughts, and many had been the longing desires to see the way open by which he could safely get rid of oppression. He was sufficiently intelligent to look at Slavery in all its bearings, and to smart keenly under even ordinarily mild treatment. Therefore, he was very happy in the realization of his hopes. In the recital of matters touching his slave life, he alluded to his master, Samuel Ball, as a &quot;very hard man,&quot; utterly unwilling to allow his servants any chance whatever. For reasons which he considered judicious, he kept the matter of his contemplated escape wholly private, not even revealing it to his wife. Probably he felt that she would not be willing to give him up, not even for freedom, as long as she could not go too. Her name was Emily, and she belonged to William Bolden. How she felt when she learned of her husband&#39;s escape is for the imagination to picture. These three interesting passengers were brought away snugly secreted in Captain B&#39;s. schooner.</p><p>JAMES CRUMMILL, SAMUAL and TOLBERT JONES and HENRY HOWARD.</p><p>This party united to throw off the yoke in Haverford county, Md.</p><p>James, Samuel and Tolbert had been owned by William Hutchins. They agreed in giving Hutchins the character of being a notorious &quot;frolicker,&quot; and a &quot;very hard master.&quot; Under him, matters were growing &quot;worse and worse.&quot; Before the old master&#39;s death times were much better.</p><p>Henry did not live under the same authority that his three companions were subjected to, but belonged to Philip Garrison. The continual threat to sell harassed Henry so much, that he saw no chance of peace or happiness in the future. So one day the master laid the &quot;last straw on the camel&#39;s back,&quot; and not another day would Henry stay. Many times it required a pretty heavy pressure to start off a number of young men, but in this instance they seemed unwilling to wait to be worn out under the yoke and violent treatment, or to become encumbered with wives and children before leaving. All were single, with the exception of James, whose wife was free, and named Charlotte; she understood about his going to Canada, and, of course, was true to him.</p><p>These young men had of course been reared under circumstances altogether unfavorable to mental development. Nevertheless they had fervent aspirations to strike for freedom.</p><p>Lewis Giles belonged, in the prison-house of bondage, in the city of Richmond, and owed service to a Mr. Lewis Hill, who made it a business to keep slaves expressly to hire out, just as a man keeps a livery stable. Lewis was not satisfied with this arrangement; he could see no fair play in it. In fact, he was utterly at variance with the entire system of Slavery, and, a long time before he left, had plans laid with a view of escaping. Through one of the Underground Rail Road Agents the glad tidings were borne to him that a passage might be procured on a schooner for twenty-five dollars. Lewis at once availed himself of this offer, and made his arrangements accordingly. He, however, made no mention of this contemplated movement to his wife, Louisa; and, to her astonishment, he was soon among the missing. Lewis was a fine-looking &quot;article,&quot; six feet high, well proportioned, and of a dark chestnut color, worth probably $1200, in the Richmond market. Touching his slave life, he said that he had been treated &quot;pretty well,&quot; except that he &quot;had been sold several times.&quot; Intellectually he was above the average run of slaves. He left on the twenty-third of April, and arrived about the second of June, having, in the meantime, encountered difficulties and discouragements of various kinds. His safe arrival, therefore, was attended with unusual rejoicing.</p><p>Daniel Bennett and his wife and children were the next in order. A woman poorly clad with a babe just one month old in her arms, and a little boy at her side, who could scarcely toddle, together with a husband who had never dared under penalty of the laws to protect her or her little ones, presented a most painfully touching picture. It was easy enough to see, that they had been crushed. The husband had been owned by Captain James Taylor--the wife and children by George Carter.</p><p>The young mother gave Carter a very bad character, affirming, that it was a &quot;common practice with him to flog the slaves, stripped entirely naked&quot;--that she had herself been so flogged, since she had been a married woman. How the husband was treated, the record book is silent. He was about thirty-two--the wife about twenty-seven. Especial pains were taken to provide aid and sympathy to this family in their destitution, fleeing under such peculiarly trying circumstances and from such loathsome brutality. They were from Aldie P.O., London County, Virginia, and passed through the hands of the Committee about the 11th of June. What has been their fate since is not known.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>SUNDRY ARRIVALS ABOUT JANUARY FIRST, 1855.</p><p>VERENEA MERCER.</p><p>The steamship Pennsylvania, on one of her regular trips from Richmond, brought one passenger, of whom the Captain had no knowledge; no permission had been asked of any officer of the boat. Nevertheless, Verenea Mercer managed, by the most extraordinary strategy, to secrete herself on the steamer, and thus succeeded in reaching Philadelphia. She was following her husband, who escaped about nine months before her.</p><p>Verenea was about forty-one years of age, of a dark chestnut color, prepossessing in manners, intelligent and refined. She belonged to the slave population of Richmond, and was owned by Thomas W. Quales. According to her testimony, she had not received severe treatment during the eight and a half years that she had been in his hands. Previous to his becoming the owner of Verenea, it might have been otherwise, although nothing is recorded in proof of this inference, except that she had the misfortune to lose her first husband by a sale. Of course she was left a widow, in which state she remained nine years, at the expiration of which period, she married a man by the name of James Mercer, whose narrative may be found on p. 54.</p><p>How James got off, and where he went, Verenea knew quite well; consequently, in planning to reach him, she resorted to the same means by which he achieved success. The Committee rendered her the usual aid, and sent her on direct to her husband in Canada. Without difficulty of any kind she reached there safely, and found James with arms wide open to embrace her. Frequent tidings reached the Committee, that they were getting along quite well in Toronto.</p><p>On the same day (January 1st), PETER DERRICKSON and CHARLES PURNELL arrived from Berlin, Worcester county, Maryland. Both were able-bodied young men, twenty-four and twenty-six years of age, just the kind that a trader, or an experienced slave-holder in the farming business, would be most likely to select for doing full days&#39; work in the field, or for bringing high prices in the market.</p><p>Peter toiled and toiled, with twenty others, on John Derrickson&#39;s farm. And although Derrickson was said to be a &quot;mild master,&quot; Peter decidedly objected to working for him for nothing. He thought over his situation a great deal, and finally came to the conclusion, that he must get from under the yoke, if possible, before entering another New Year. His friend Charles he felt could be confided in, therefore he made up his mind, that he would broach the question of Canada and the Underground Rail Road to him. Charles was equally ready and willing to enter into any practical arrangements by which he could get rid of his no-pay task-master, and be landed safely in Canada. After taking into account the dangers likely to attend such a struggle, they concluded that they would risk all and try their luck, as many had done before them.</p><p>&quot;What made you leave, Charles?&quot; said a member of the Committee.</p><p>&quot;I left because I wanted my time and money for myself.&quot;</p><p>No one could gainsay such a plain common-sense answer as that. The fact, that he had to leave his parents, three brothers, and five sisters, all in slavery, brought sad reflections.</p><p>LLOYD HACKET, alias Perry Watkins and WILLIAM HENRY JOHNSON, alias John Wesley.</p><p>No weather was too cold for travel, nor way too rough, when the slave was made to feel by his heartless master, that he was going to sell him or starve him to death.</p><p>Lloyd had toiled on until he had reached fifty-five, before he came to the conclusion, that he could endure the treatment of his master, John Griffin, no longer, simply because &quot;he was not good to feed and clothe,&quot; and was a &quot;great fighter.&quot; Moreover, he would &quot;never suffer his slaves to stop work on account of bad weather.&quot; Not only was his master cruel in these particulars, but he was equally cruel with regard to selling. Georgia was continually held up to the slaves with a view of producing a wholesome fear, but in this instance, as in many similar ones, it only awakened desires to seek flight via the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>Lloyd, convinced by experience, that matters with him would be no better, but worse and worse, resolved that he would start with the opening of the New Year to see if he could not find a better country than the one that he was then in.</p><p>He consulted William, who, although a young man of only twenty-four years of age, had the hate of slavery exceedingly strong in his heart, and was at once willing to accompany Lloyd--ready to face cold weather and start on a long walk if freedom could be thus purchased, and his master, John Hall, thus defeated. So Lloyd took a heroic leave of his wife, Mary Ann, and their little boy, one brother, one sister, and two nieces, and at once set out with William, like pilgrims and strangers seeking a better country--where they would not have to go &quot;hungry&quot; and be &quot;worked hard in all weather,&quot; threatened with the auction-block, and brutally flogged if they merely seemed unwilling to endure a yoke too grievous to be borne. Both these travelers were mulattoes, and but for the crushing influences that they had lived under would have made smart men--as it was they showed plainly, that they were men of shrewd sense.</p><p>Inadvertently at the time of their arrival, the names of the State and place whence they fled were not entered on the book.</p><p>In traveling they suffered severely from hunger and the long distance they had to walk, but having succeeded victoriously they were prepared to rejoice all the more.</p><p>DAVID EDWARDS. John J. Slater, coachmaker of Petersburg, Virginia, if he is still living, and should see these items, may solve what may have been for years a great mystery to him--namely, that David, his man-servant, was enjoying himself in Philadelphia about the first week in January, 1855, receiving free accommodations and obtaining letters of introduction to friends in Canada. Furthermore, that David alleged that he was induced to escape because he (the coachmaker) was a very hard man, who took every dollar of his earnings, from which he would dole out to him only one dollar a week for board, etc., a sum less than David could manage to get along with.</p><p>David was thirty years of age, black, weighed one hundred and forty-five pounds, and was worth one thousand dollars. He left his wife behind.</p><p>BEVERLY GOOD and GEORGE WALKER, alias Austin Valentine. These passengers came from Petersburg, per steamship Pennsylvania. Richard Perry was lording it over Beverly, who was a young man of twenty-four years of age, dark, medium size, and possessed of a quick intellect--just the man that an Underground Rail Road agent in the South could approach with assurance with questions such as these--&quot;What do you think of Slavery?&quot; &quot;Did you ever hear of the Underground Rail Road?&quot; &quot;How would you like to be free?&quot; &quot;Would you be willing to go to Canada if you could get off safely,&quot; etc., etc.</p><p>Such questions at once kindled into a flame the sparks of freedom lying dormant in the heart. Although uttered in a whisper, they had a wondrous ring about them, and a wide-awake bondman instantly grasped their meaning. Beverly was of this class; he needed no arguments to prove that he was daily robbed of his rights--that Slavery was merciless and freedom the God-given right of all mankind. Of him, therefore, there was no fear that he would betray his trust or flinch too soon when cramped up in his hiding-place on the steamer.</p><p>His comrade, George, was likewise of the same mettle, and was aided in the same way. George, however, had more age on his side, being about forty-three. He was about six feet high, with marked physical and mental abilities, but Slavery had had its heel upon his neck. And who could then have risen?</p><p>Eliza Jones held the deed for George, and by her he was hired as foreman in a tobacco factory, in which position his duties were onerous--especially to one with a heavy, bleeding heart, throbbing daily for freedom, while, at the same time, mournfully brooding over past wrongs. Of these wrongs one incident must suffice. He had been married twice, and had been the father of six children by his first wife; at the command of his owner the wedded relations were abruptly broken, and he was obliged to seek another wife. In entering this story on the book at the time of the arrival, the concluding words were written thus: &quot;This story is thrilling, but time will not allow its being penned.&quot;</p><p>Although safely under the protection of the British Lion, George&#39;s heart was in Virginia, where his wife was retained. As he could not return for her deliverance, he was wise enough to resort to the pen, hoping in this way to effect his grand object, as the following letter will show:</p><pre><code>TORONTO, January 25th, 1855.

DEAR FRIEND STILL:--George Walker, of Petersburg, Va., is now in
my office, and requests me to write a letter to you, and request
you to write to his wife, after or according to the instructions
he gave to his friend, John Brown, in your city, with whom he
says you are acquainted. You will understand, of course, his
reason for wanting the letter wrote and posted at Philadelphia.
You will please attend to it and address a letter to him
(Walker) in my care. He and Beverly Good, his comrade, tender
much love to you. Send them on; we are prepared for them. Yours
in great haste, J.B. SMITH.

P.S.--Be sure and follow the directions given to Brown.
</code></pre><p>ADAM BROOKS, alias William Smith. Hardtown, Montgomery county, Maryland, lost a rather promising &quot;article of merchandise,&quot; in the person of Adam. The particulars of his going are on this wise: John Phillips, his so-called master, believed in selling, and practiced accordinglv, to the extent at least of selling Adam&#39;s mother, brother, and sister only two years before his escape.</p><p>If Adam had known nothing else against Phillips, this was enough in all conscience to have awakened his deadly hate; but, added to this, Phillips was imprudent in his habit of threatening to &quot;sell,&quot; etc. This kept the old wound in Adam&#39;s heart continually bleeding and forced him to the conclusion, that his master was not only a hard man, as a driver on the farm, but that at heart he was actually a bad man. Furthermore, that it was his duty to break his fetters and seek his freedom in Canada.</p><p>In thus looking at his situation, his mind was worked up to fever heat, and he resolved that, let the consequences be what they might, go he must. In this promising state of mind he started, at an appointed time, for Pennsylvania, and, sure enough, he succeeded. Having the appearance of a desirable working-hand, a Pennsylvania farmer prevailed on him to stop for a time. It was not long before the folly of this halt was plainly discernible, as his master had evidently got wind of his whereabouts, and was pretty hot in pursuit. Word reached Adam, however, barely in time for him to make his escape through the aid of friends.</p><p>In coming into the hands of the Committee he needed no persuading to go to Canada; he was occupied with two interesting problems, to go back or to go forward. But he set his face hopefully towards Canada, and had no thought of stopping short thereof. In stature, he was small; color, black; countenance, pleasant, and intellect, medium. As to his fitness for making a good citizen in Canada the Committee had no doubt.</p><p>SARAH A. DUNAGAN. Having no one to care for her, and, having been threatened with the auction-block, Sarah mustered pluck and started out in search of a new home among strangers beyond the borders of slave territory. According to her story, she &quot;was born free&quot; in the State of Delaware, but had been &quot;bound out&quot; to a man by the name of George Churchman, living in Wilmington. Here she averred, that she &quot;had been flogged repeatedly,&quot; and had been otherwise ill-treated, while no one interfered to take her part. Consequently she concluded, that although she was born free, she would not be likely to be benefited thereby unless she made her escape on the Underground Rail Road. This idea of freedom continued to agitate Sarah&#39;s mind until she decided to leave forthwith. She was a young mulatto woman, single, and told her story of hardships and of the dread of being sold, in a manner to elicit much sympathy. She had a mother living in New Castle, named Ann Eliza Kingslow. It was no uncommon thing for free-born persons in slave States to lose their birth-right in a manner similar to that by which Sarah feared that she had lost hers.</p><p>&quot;Arrived JOSEPH HALL, JR., son of Joseph Hall, of Norfolk, Virginia.&quot; This is all that is recorded of this passenger, yet it is possible that this item of news may lead to the recognition of Joseph, should he still happen to be of the large multitude of fugitives scattered over the land amongst the living.</p><p>ISAAC D. DAVIS. In fleeing from bondage, in Maryland, Davis was induced to stop, as many others were, in Pennsylvania. Not comprehending the Fugitive Slave Law he fancied that he would be safe so long as he kept matters private concerning his origin. But in this particular he labored under a complete delusion--when he least dreamed of danger the slave-catchers were scenting him close. Of their approach, however, he was fortunate enough to be notified in time to place himself in the hands of the Committee, who soon held out Canada to him, as the only sure refuge for him, and all others similarly situated. His fears of being carried back opened his eyes, and understanding, so that he could readily see the force of this argument, and accepting the proffered aid of the Committee was sent on his way rejoicing. He had been away from his master eighteen months, and in the meanwhile had married a wife in Pennsylvania. What became of them after this flight the book contains no record.</p><p>JACOB MATTHIAS BOYER left at about the age of twenty. He had no idea of working in the condition of a slave, but if he had not been threatened with the auction-block, he might have remained much longer than he did. He had been owned by Richard Carman, cashier of one of the Annapolis banks, and who had recently died. Jacob fled from Annapolis. Very little record was made of either master or slave. Probably no incidents were related of sufficient importance, still the Committee felt pleased to receive one so young. Indeed, it always afforded the Committee especial satisfaction to see children, young people, and females escaping from the prison-house. Jacob was of a dark hue, a little below medium stature.</p><p>ZECHARIAH MEAD, alias John Williams. This traveler had been in the house of bondage in Maryland, doing service for Charles C. Owens, to whom he belonged. According to Zechariah&#39;s statement, his mistress had been very unfortunate with her slave property, having lost fifteen head out of twenty in a similar manner to that by which she lost Zechariah. Thus she had been considerably reduced in circumstances. But Zechariah had no compassion on her whatever, but insisted that she was a hard mistress. Doubtless Zechariah was prompted to flee by the &quot;bad&quot; example of others who had succeeded in making good their escape, before he had made up his mind to leave. He was not yet quite twenty-one, but was wide-awake, and it appeared from his conversation, that he had done some close thinking before he started for freedom. He left his father, mother, and three brothers, all slaves except his father.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>SLAVE-HOLDER IN MARYLAND WITH THREE COLORED WIVES.</p><p>JAMES GRIFFIN ALIAS THOMAS BROWN.</p><p>James was a tiller of the soil under the yoke of Joshua Hitch, who lived on a farm about seventeen miles from Baltimore. James spoke rather favorably of him; indeed, it was through a direct act of kindness on the part of his master that he procured the opportunity to make good his escape. It appeared from his story, that his master&#39;s affairs had become particularly embarrassed, and the Sheriff was making frequent visits to his house. This sign was interpreted to mean that James, if not others, would have to be sold before long. The master was much puzzled to decide which way to turn. He owned but three other adult slaves besides James, and they were females. One of them was his chief housekeeper, and with them all his social relations were of such a nature as to lead James and others to think and say that they &quot;were all his wives.&quot; Or to use James&#39;s own language, &quot;he had three slave women; two were sisters, and he lived with them all as his wives; two of them he was very fond of,&quot; and desired to keep them from being sold if possible. The third, he concluded he could not save, she would have to be sold. In this dilemma, he was good enough to allow James a few days&#39; holiday, for the purpose of finding him a good master. Expressing his satisfaction and gratification, James, armed with full authority from his master to select a choice specimen, started for Baltimore.</p><p>On reaching Baltimore, however, James carefully steered clear of all slave-holders, and shrewdly turned his attention to the matter of getting an Underground Rail Road ticket for Canada. After making as much inquiry as he felt was safe, he came to the conclusion to walk of nights for a long distance. He examined his feet and legs, found that they were in good order, and his faith and hope strong enough to remove a mountain. Besides several days still remained in which he was permitted to look for a new master, and these he decided could be profitably spent in making his way towards Canada. So off he started, at no doubt a very diligent pace, for at the end of the first night&#39;s journey, he had made much headway, but at the expense of his feet.</p><p>His faith was stronger than ever. So he rested next day in the woods, concealed, of course, and the next evening started with fresh courage and renewed perseverance. Finally, he reached Columbia, Pennsylvania, and there he had the happiness to learn, that the mountain which at first had tried his faith so severely, was removed, and friendly hands were reached out and a more speedy and comfortable mode of travel advised. He was directed to the Vigilance Committee in Philadelphia, from whom he received friendly aid, and all necessary information respecting Canada and how to get there.</p><p>James was thirty-one years of age, rather a fine-looking man, of a chestnut color, and quite intelligent. He had been a married man, but for two years before his escape, he had been a widower--that is, his wife had been sold away from him to North Carolina, and in that space of time he had received only three letters from her; he had given up all hope of ever seeing her again. He had two little boys living in Baltimore, whom he was obliged to leave. Their names were Edward and William. What became of them afterwards was never known at the Philadelphia station.</p><p>James&#39;s master was a man of about fifty years of age--who had never been lawfully married, yet had a number of children on his place who were of great concern to him in the midst of other pressing embarrassments. Of course, the Committee never learned how matters were settled after James left, but, in all probability, his wives, Nancy and Mary (sisters), and Lizzie, with all the children, had to be sold.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

RESPECTED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I now have the pleasure of
consigning to thy care four able-bodied human beings from North
Carolina, and five from Virginia, one of which is a girl twelve
or thirteen years of age, the rest all men. After thee has seen
and conversed with them, thee can determine what is best to be
done with them. I am assured they are such as can take good care
of themselves. Elijah Pennypacker, some time since, informed me
he could find employment in his neighborhood for two or three
good hands. I should think that those from Carolina would be
about as safe in that neighborhood as any place this side of
Canada. Wishing our friends a safe trip, I remain thy sincere
friend,

THOS. GARRETT.

After conferring with Harry Craige, we have concluded to send
five or six of them tonight in the cars, and the balance, if
those go safe, to-morrow night, or in the steam-boat on Second
day morning, directed to the Anti-Slavery office.
</code></pre><p>There was much rejoicing over these select passengers, and very much interesting information was elicited from them.</p><p>Peter was only twenty-one years of age, composed of equal parts of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-African blood--rather a model-looking &quot;article,&quot; with a fair share of intelligence. As a slave, he had fared pretty well--he had neither been abused nor stinted of food or clothing, as many others had been. His duties had been to attend upon his master (and reputed father), Elias Heines, Esq., a lawyer by profession in North Carolina.</p><p>No charges whatever appear to have been made against Mr. Heines, according to the record book; but Peter seemed filled with great delight at the prospects ahead, as well as with the success that had attended his efforts thus far in striking for freedom.</p><p>James was twenty-seven years of age. His experience had been quite different from that of Peter&#39;s. The heel of a woman, by the name of Mrs. Ann McCourt, had been on James&#39;s neck, and she had caused him to suffer severely. As James recounted his grievances, while under the rule, he by no means gave her a very flattering character, but, on the contrary, he plainly stated, that she was a &quot;desperate woman&quot;--that he had &quot;never known any good of her,&quot; and that he was moved to escape to get rid of her. In other words she had threatened to sell him; this well nigh produced frenzy in James&#39;s mind, for too well did he remember, that he had already been sold three times, and in different stages of his bondage had been treated quite cruelly. In the change of masters he was positive in saying, that he had not found a good one, and, besides, he entertained the belief that such personages were very rare.</p><p>Those of the Committee who listened to James were not a little amazed at his fluency, intelligence and earnestness, and acknowledged that he dealt unusually telling blows against the Patriarchal Institution.</p><p>Matthew was twenty-three years of age, very stout--no fool--a man of decided resolution, and of the very best black complexion produced in the South. Matthew had a very serious bill of complaints against Samuel Simmons, who professed to own him (Matthew), both body and mind, while in this world at least. Among these complaints was the charge of ill-treatment. Nevertheless Matthew&#39;s joy and pleasure were matchless over his Underground Rail Road triumph, and the prospect of being so soon out of the land and reach of Slavery, and in a land where he could enjoy his freedom as others enjoyed theirs. Indeed the entire band evinced similar feelings. Matthew left a brother in Martin county.</p><p>Further sketches of this interesting company were not entered on the book at the time, perhaps on account of the great press of Underground Rail Road business which engaged the attention of the acting Committee. However, they were all duly cared for, and counselled to go to Canada, where their rights would be protected by a strong and powerful government, and they could enjoy all the rights of citizenship in common with &quot;all the world and the rest of mankind.&quot; And especially were they advised to get education; to act as men, and remember those still in bonds as bound with them, and that they must not forget to write back, after their arrival in Canada, to inform their friends in Philadelphia of their prospects, and what they thought of the &quot;goodly land.&quot; Thus, with the usual Underground Rail Road passports, they were again started Canada-ward. Without difficulty of any kind they duly reached Canada, and a portion of them wrote back as follows:</p><pre><code>&quot;TORONTO, C.W., Aug. 17th, 1856.

MR, STILL:--Dear Sir--These few lines may find you as they leave
us, we are well at present and arrived safe in Toronto. Give our
respects to Mrs. S.---- and daughter. Toronto is a very
extensive place. We have plenty of pork, beef and mutton. There
are five market houses and many churches. Female wages is 62-1/2
cents per day, men&#39;s wages is $1 and york shilling. We are now
boarding at Mr. George Blunt&#39;s, on Centre street, two doors from
Elm, back of Lawyer&#39;s Hall, and when you write to us, direct
your letter to the care of Mr. George Blunt, &amp;c. (Signed), James
Monroe, Peter Heines, Henry James Morris, and Matthew Bodame.&quot;
</code></pre><p>This intelligence was very gratifying, and most assuredly added to the pleasurable contemplation of having the privilege of holding out a helping hand to the fleeing bondman. From James Morris, one of this company, however, letters of a painful nature were received, touching his wife in bonds, setting forth her &quot;awful&quot; situation and appealing to the Committee to use their best endeavors to rescue her, with her child, from Slavery. One of these letters, so full of touching sentiments of affection and appeal on behalf of his wife, is as follows:</p><pre><code>TORONTO, Canada West, upper, 18th day of the 9th mo., 1856.

MR. WILLIAM STILL:--Dear Sir--I hope these lines may find you

Caroline and her mother.

Dear Sir, I have received two letters from my wife since I saw
you, and the second was awful. I am sorry to say she says she
has been treated awful since I left, and she told the lady she
thought she was left free and she told her she was as much slave
as ever she was that the state was not to be settled until her
death and it would be a meracle if she and her child got it then
and that her master left a great many relations and she diden no
what they would do. Mr. Still dear sir I am very sorry to hear
my wife and child are slaves if you please dear sir inform me
what to do for my dear wife and child. She said she has been
threatened to be put in jail three times since I left also she
tells me that she is washing for the captain of a vesel that use

doors from Elam.
</code></pre><p>This sad letter made a mournful impression, as it was not easy to see how her deliverance was to be effected. One feature, however, about this epistle afforded much satisfaction, namely, to know, that James did not forget his poor wife and child, who were in the prison-house. Many months after this first letter came to hand, Mrs. Dr. Willis, one of the first ladies in Toronto, wrote on his behalf as follows:</p><pre><code>TORONTO, 15th June, Monday morning, 1857.

To MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I write you this letter for a
respectable young man (his name is James Morris), he passed
through your hands July of last year (1856), and has just had a
letter from his wife, whom he left behind in Virginia, that she
and her child are likely to be sold. He is very anxious about
this and wishful that she could get away by some vessel or
otherwise. His wife&#39;s name is Lucy Morris; the child&#39;s name is
Lot Morris; the lady&#39;s name she lives with is a Mrs. Hine (I
hope I spell her name right, Hine), at the corner of Duke street
and Washington street, in Norfolk city, Virginia. She is hired
out to this rich old widow lady. James Morris wishes me to write
you--he has saved forty dollars, and will send it to you
whenever it is required, to bring her on to Toronto, Canada
West. It is in the bank ready upon call. Will you please, sir,
direct your letter in reply to this, to a Mrs. Ringgold, Centre
street, two doors from Elam street, Toronto, Canada West, as I
will be out of town. I write this instead of Mr. Thomas Henning,
who is just about leaving for England. Hoping you will reply
soon, I remain, sir,

Respectfully yours,

AGNES WILLIS.
</code></pre><p>Whether James ever succeeded in recovering his wife and child, is not known to the writer. Many similarly situated were wont to appeal again and again, until growing entirely hopeless, they would conclude to marry.</p><p>Here it may be remarked, with reference to marrying, that of the great number of fugitives in Canada, the male sex was largely in preponderance over the female, and many of them were single young men. This class found themselves very acceptable to Irish girls, and frequently legal alliances were the result. And it is more than likely, that there are white women in Canada to-day, who are married to some poor slave woman&#39;s fugitive husband.</p><p>Verily, the romantic and tragic phases of the Underground Rail Road are without number, if not past finding out.</p><p>Scarcely had the above-mentioned nine left the Philadelphia depot, ere the following way-worn travelers came to hand:</p><p>PERRY SHEPHARD, and ISAAC REED, Eastern Shore, Maryland; GEORGE SPERRYMAN, <em>alias</em> THOMAS JOHNSON, Richmond; VALENTINE SPIRES, near Petersburg; DANIEL GREEN, <em>alias</em> GEORGE TAYLOR, Leesburg, Virginia; JAMES JOHNSON, <em>alias</em> WILLIAM GILBERT and wife HARRIET, Prince George&#39;s county, Maryland; HENRY COOPER, and WILLIAM ISRAEL SMITH, Middletown, Delaware; ANNA DORSEY, Maryland.</p><p>Although starting from widely separated localities without the slightest communication with each other in the South, each separate passenger earnestly bent on freedom, had endured suffering, hunger, and perils, by land and water, sustained by the hope of ultimate freedom.</p><p>PERRY SHEPHARD and ISAAC REED reported themselves as having fled from the Eastern Shore of Maryland; that they had there been held to service or Slavery by Sarah Ann Burgess, and Benjamin Franklin Houston, from whom they fled. No incidents of slave life or travel were recorded, save that Perry left his wife Milky Ann, and two children, Nancy and Rebecca (free). Also Isaac left his wife, Hester Ann Louisa, and the following named children: Philip Henry, Harriet Ann and Jane Elizabeth.</p><p>GEORGE SPERRYMAN&#39;S lot was cast amongst the oppressed in the city of Richmond, Va. Of the common ills of slave life, George could speak from experience; but little of his story, however, was recorded at the time. He had reached the Committee through the regular channel--was adjudged worthy of aid and encouragement, and they gave it to him freely. Nickless Templeman was the loser in this instance; how he bore the misfortune the Committee was not apprised. Without question, the property was delighted with getting rid of the owner.</p><p>VALENTINE SPIRES came a fellow-passenger with George, having &quot;took out&quot; the previous Christmas, from a place called Dunwoody, near Petersburg. He was held to service in that place by Dr. Jesse Squires. Under his oppressive rules and demands, Valentine had been convinced that there could be no peace, consequently he turned his attention to one idea--freedom and the Underground Rail Road, and with this faith, worked his way through to the Committee, and was received, and aided of course.</p><p>DAVID GREEN, fled from Warrington, near Leesburg. Elliott Curlett so alarmed David by threatening to sell him, that the idea of liberty immediately took possession in David&#39;s mind. David had suffered many hardships at the hands of his master, but when the auction-block was held up to him, that was the worst cut of all. He became a thinker right away. Although he had a wife and one child in Slavery, he decided to flee for his freedom at all hazards, and accordingly he carried out his firm resolution.</p><p>JAMES JOHNSON. This &quot;article&quot; was doing unrequited labor as the slave of Thomas Wallace, in Prince George county, Maryland. He was a stout and rugged-looking man, of thirty-five years of age. On escaping, he was fortunate enough to bring his wife, Harriet with him. She was ten years younger than himself, and had been owned by William T. Wood, by whom she said that she had &quot;been well treated.&quot; But of late, this Wood had taken to liquor, and she felt in danger of being sold. She knew that rum ruined the best of slave-holders, so she was admonished to get out of danger as soon as possible.</p><p>CHARLES HENRY COOPER and WILLIAM ISRAEL SMITH. These passengers were representatives of the peculiar Institution of Middletown, Delaware. Charles was owned by Catharine Mendine, and William by John P. Cather. According to their confession, Charles and William it seemed had been thinking a good deal over the idea of &quot;working for nothing,&quot; of being daily driven to support others, while they were rendered miserable thereby. So they made up their minds to try the Underground Rail Road, &quot;hit or miss.&quot; This resolution was made and carried into effect (on the part of Charles at least), at the cost of leaving a mother, three brothers, and three sisters in Slavery, without hope of ever seeing them again. The ages of Charles and William were respectively twenty-two and twenty-one. Both stout and well-made young men, with intellects well qualified to make the wilderness of Canada bud and blossom as the rose, and thitherward they were dispatched.</p><p>ANNA DORSET became tired of Slavery in Maryland, where she reported that she had been held to service by a slave-holder, known by the name of Eli Molesworth. The record is silent as to how she was treated. As a slave, she had been brought up a seamstress, and was quite intelligent. Age twenty-two, mulatto.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>OWEN AND OTHO TAYLOR&#39;S FLIGHT WITH HORSES, ETC.</p><p>THREE BROTHERS, TWO OF THEM WITH WIVES AND CHILDREN.</p><p>About the latter part of March, 1856, Owen Taylor and his wife, Mary Ann, and their little son, Edward, together with a brother and his wife and two children, and a third brother, Benjamin, arrived from near Clear Springs, nine miles from Hagerstown, Maryland. They all left their home, or rather escaped from the prison-house, on Easter Sunday, and came <em>via</em> Harrisburg, where they were assisted and directed to the Vigilance Committee in Philadelphia. A more interesting party had not reached the Committee for a long time.</p><p>The three brothers were intelligent, and heroic, and, in the resolve to obtain freedom, not only for themselves, but for their wives and children desperately in earnest. They had counted well the cost of this struggle for liberty, and had fully made up their minds that if interfered with by slave-catchers, somebody would have to bite the dust. That they had pledged themselves never to surrender alive, was obvious. Their travel-worn appearance, their attachment for each other, the joy that the tokens of friendship afforded them, the description they gave of incidents on the road, made an impression not soon to be effaced.</p><p>In the presence of a group like this Sumner&#39;s great and eloquent speech on the Barbarism of Slavery, seemed almost cold and dead,--the mute appeals of these little ones in their mother&#39;s arms--the unlettered language of these young mothers, striving to save their offspring from the doom of Slavery--the resolute and manly bearing of these brothers expressed in words full of love of liberty, and of the determination to resist Slavery to the death, in defence of their wives and children--this was Sumner&#39;s speech enacted before our eyes.</p><p>Owen was about thirty-one years of age, but had experienced a deal of trouble. He had been married twice, and both wives were believed to be living. The first one, with their little child, had been sold in the Baltimore market, about three years before, the mother was sent to Louisiana, the child to South Carolina. Father, mother, and child, parted with no hope of ever seeing each other again in this world. After Owen&#39;s wife was sent South, he sent her his likeness and a dress; the latter was received, and she was greatly delighted with it, but he never heard of her having received his likeness. He likewise wrote to her, but he was not sure that she received his letters. Finally, he came to the conclusion that as she was forever dead to him, he would do well to marry again. Accordingly he took to himself another partner, the one who now accompanied him on the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>Omitting other interesting incidents, a reference to his handiwork will suffice to show the ability of Owen. Owen was a born mechanic, and his master practically tested his skill in various ways; sometimes in the blacksmith shop--at other times as a wheelwright--again at making brushes and brooms, and at leisure times he would try his hand in all these crafts. This Jack-of-all-trades was, of course, very valuable to his master. Indeed his place was hard to fill.</p><p>Henry Fiery, a farmer, &quot;about sixty-four years of age, a stout, crusty old fellow,&quot; was the owner of Owen and his two brothers. Besides slaves, the old man was in possession of a wife, whose name was Martha, and seven children, who were pretty well grown up. One of the sons owned Owen&#39;s wife and two children. Owen declared, that they had been worked hard, while few privileges had been allowed them. Clothing of the poorest texture was only sparingly furnished. Nothing like Sunday raiment was ever given them; for these comforts they were compelled to do over-work of nights. For a long time the idea of escape had been uppermost in the minds of this party. The first of January, past, was the time &quot;solemnly&quot; fixed upon to &quot;took out,&quot; but for some reason or other (not found on the record book), their strategical minds did not see the way altogether clear, and they deferred starting until Easter Sunday.</p><p>On that memorable evening, the men boldly harnessed two of Mr. Fiery&#39;s steeds and placing their wives and children in the carriage, started off <em>via</em> Hagerstown, in a direct line for Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, at a rate that allowed no grass to grow under the horses&#39; feet. In this manner they made good time, reached Chambersburg safely, and ventured up to a hotel where they put up their horses. Here they bade their faithful beasts good-bye and &quot;took out&quot; for Harrisburg by another mode of travel, the cars. On their arrival they naturally fell into the hands of the Committee, who hurried them off to Philadelphia, apprising the Committee there of their approach by a dispatch sent ahead. Probably they had scarcely reached Philadelphia ere the Fierys were in hot haste after them, as far as Harrisburg, if not farther.</p><p>It hardly need be hinted, that the community in which the Fierys lived was deeply agitated for days after, as indeed it was along the entire route to Chambersburg, in consequence of this bold and successful movement. The horses were easily captured at the hotel, where they were left, but, of course, they were mute as to what had become of their drivers. The furious Fierys probably got wind of the fact, that they had made their way to Harrisburg. At any rate they made very diligent search at this point. While here prosecuting his hunting operations, Fiery managed to open communication with at least one member of the Harrisburg Committee, to whom his grievances were made known, but derived little satisfaction.</p><p>After the experience of a few weeks, the pursuers came to the conclusion, that there was no likelihood of recovering them through these agencies, or through the Fugitive Slave Law. In their despair, therefore, they resorted to another &quot;dodge.&quot; All at once they became &quot;sort-o&#39;-friendly&quot;--indeed more than half disposed to emancipate. The member of the Committee in Harrisburg had, it is probable, frequently left room for their great delusion, if he did not even go so far as to feed their hopes with plausible suggestions, that some assistance might be afforded by which an amicable settlement might be made between masters and slaves.</p><p>The following extract, from the Committee&#39;s letter, relative to this matter, is open to this inference, and may serve to throw some light on the subject:</p><pre><code>HARRISBURG, April 28, &#39;56.

Friend Still:--Your last came to hand in due season, and I am
happy to hear of the safe arrival of those gents.

I have before me the Power of Attorney of Mr. John S. Fiery, son
of Mr. Henry Fiery, of Washington county, Md., the owner of
those three men, two women and three children, who arrived in
your town on the 24th or 25th of March. He graciously
condescends to liberate the oldest in a year, and the remainder
in proportional time, if they will come back; or to sell them
their time for $1300. He is sick of the job, and is ready to
make any conditions. Now, if you personally can get word to them
and get them to send him a letter, in my charge, informing him
of their whereabouts and prospects, I think it will be the best
answer I can make him. He will return here in a week or two, to
know what can be done. He offers $500 to see them.

Or if you can send me word where they are, I will endeavor to
write to them for his special satisfaction; or if you cannot do
either, send me your latest information, for I intend to make
him spend a few more dollars, and if possible get a little
sicker of this bad job. Do try and send him a few bitter pills
for his weak nerves and disturbed mind.

Yours in great haste,

Jos. C. Bustill.
</code></pre><p>A subsequent letter from Mr. Bustill contains, besides other interesting Underground Rail Road matter, an item relative to the feeling of disappointment experienced by Mr. Fiery on learning that his property was in Canada.</p><pre><code>HARRISBURG, May 26, &#39;56.

Friend Still:--I embrace the opportunity presented by the visit
of our friend, John F. Williams, to drop you a few lines in
relation to our future operations.

The Lightning Train was put on the Road on last Monday, and as
the traveling season has commenced and this is the Southern
route for Niagara Falls, I have concluded not to send by way of
Auburn, except in cases of great danger; but hereafter we will
use the Lightning Train, which leaves here at 1-1/2 and arrives
in your city at 5 o&#39;clock in the morning, and I will telegraph
about 5-1/2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, so it may reach you before
you close. These four are the only ones that have come since my
last. The woman has been here some time waiting for her child
and her beau, which she expects here about the first of June. If
possible, please keep a knowledge of her whereabouts, to enable
me to inform him if he comes.

_I have nothing more to send you, except that John Fiery has
visited us again and much to his chagrin received the
information of their being in Canada_.

Yours as ever,

Jos. C. Bustill.

Whilst the Fierys were working like beavers to re-enslave these
brave fugitives, the latter were daily drinking in more and more
of the spirit of freedom and were busy with schemes for the
deliverance of other near kin left behind under the galling
yoke.

Several very interesting letters were received from Otho Taylor,
relative to a raid he designed making expressly to effect the
escape of his family. The two subjoined must suffice, (others,
much longer, cannot now be produced, they have probably been
loaned and not returned.)


    APRIL 15th, 1857.

    SIR--We arrived here safely. Mr. Syrus and his lady is
    well situated. They have a place for the year round 15
    dollars per month. We are all well and hope that you are
    all the same. Now I wish to know whether you would
    please to send me some money to go after those people.
    Send it here if you please.

    Yours truly,

    OTHO TAYLOR.

    WILLIAM STILL.


ST. CATHARINES, Jan. 26, 1857.

MR. WM. STILL:--Dear Sir--I write at this time in behalf of Otho
Taylor. He is very anxious to go and get his family at Clear
Spring, Washington county, Md. He would like to know if the
Society there would furnish him the means to go after them from
Philadelphia, that you will be running no risk in doing this. If
the Society can do this, he would not be absent from P. more
than three days.

He is so anxious to get his family from slavery that he is
willing to do almost anything to get them to Canada. You may
possibly recollect him--he was at your place last August. I
think he can be trusted. If you can do something for him, he has
the means to take him to your place.

Please let me know immediately if you can do this.

Respectfully yours,

M.A.H. WILSON.

He was destitute, of course, just as anybody else would have been, if robbers had stripped him of every dollar of his earnings; but he felt pretty sure, that he could take care of himself in her Majesty&#39;s dominion.</p><p>The Committee, encouraged by his efforts, reached him a helping hand and sent him on to swell the goodly number in the promised land--Canada.</p><p>On the same day that Tom arrived, the Committee had the pleasure of taking JAMES JONES by the hand. He was owned by Dr. William Stewart, of King George&#39;s Court House, Maryland. He was not, however, in the service of his master at the time of his escape but was hired out in Alexandria. For some reason, not noticed in the book, James became dissatisfied, changed his name to Henry Rider, got an Underground Rail Road pass and left the Dr. and his other associations in Maryland. He was one of the well-cared for &quot;articles,&quot; and was of very near kin to the white people, at least a half-brother (mulatto, of course). He was thirty-two years of age, medium size, hard-featured and raw-boned, but &quot;no marks about him.&quot;</p><p>James looked as if he had had pretty good health, still the Committee thought that he would have much better in Canada. After hearing a full description of that country and of the great number of fugitives there from Maryland and other parts of the South, &quot;Jim&quot; felt that that was just the place he wanted to find, and was soon off with a free ticket, a letter of introduction, etc.</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *
</code></pre><p>CAPTAIN F. ARRIVES WITH FOURTEEN &quot;PRIME ARTICLES&quot; ON BOARD.</p><p>Thomas Garrett announced this in the following letter:</p><pre><code>WILMINGTON, 3d mo., 23d, 1856.

DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Captain Fountain has arrived all
safe, with the human cargo thee was inquiring for, a few days
since. I had men waiting till 12 o&#39;clock till the Captain
arrived at his berth, ready to receive them; last night they
then learned, that he had landed them at the Rocks, near the old
Swedes church, in the care of our efficient Pilot, who is in the
employ of my friend, John Hillis, and he has them now in charge.
As soon as my breakfast is over, I will see Hillis and determine
what is best to be done in their case. My own opinion is, we had
better send them to Hook and there put them in the cars to-night
and send a pilot to take them to thy house. As Marcus Hook is in
Pennsylvania, the agent of the cars runs no risk of the fine of
five hundred dollars our State imposes for assisting one of
God&#39;s poor out of the State by steamboat or cars.

As ever thy friend,

THOS. GAREETT.
</code></pre><p>NAMES OF THE &quot;ARTICLES.&quot;</p><p>Rebecca Jones, and her three daughters, Sarah Frances, Mary, and Rebecca; Isaiah Robinson, Arthur Spence, Caroline Taylor, and her two daughters, Nancy, and Mary; Daniel Robinson; Thomas Page; Benjamin Dickinson; David Cole and wife.</p><p>From the tenor of Thomas Garrett&#39;s letter, the Committee was prepared for a joyful reception, knowing that Captain F. was not in the habit of doing things by the halves--that he was not in the habit of bringing numbskulls; indeed he brought none but the bravest and most intelligent. Yet notwithstanding our knowledge of his practice in this respect, when he arrived we were surprised beyond measure. The women outnumbered the men. The two young mothers, with their interesting, hearty and fine-looking children representing in blood the two races about equally--presented a very impressive spectacle.</p><p>The men had the appearance of being active, smart, and well disposed, much above the generality of slaves; but, compared with those of the opposite sex, their claims for sympathy were very faint indeed. No one could possibly avoid the conclusion, that these mothers, with their handsome daughters, were valued on the Ledger of their owners at enormously high prices; that lustful traders and sensualists had already gloated over the thought of buying them in a few short years. Probably not one of those beautiful girls would have brought less than fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars at the age of fifteen. It was therefore a great satisfaction to think, that their mothers, who knew full well to what a fate such slave girls were destined, had labored so heroically to snatch them out of this danger ere the critical hour arrived.</p><p>Rebecca Jones was about twenty-eight years of age; mulatto, good-looking, considerably above medium size, very intelligent, and a true-born heroine.</p><p>The following reward, offered by the notorious negro-trader, Hall, proved that Rebecca and her children were not to be allowed to go free, if slave-hunters could be induced by a heavy pecuniary consideration to recapture them:</p><pre><code>$300 REWARD is offered for the apprehension of negro woman,
REBECCA JONES and her three children, and man ISAIAH, belonging
to W.W. Davidson, who have disappeared since the 20th inst. The
above reward will be paid for the apprehension and delivery of
the said Negroes to my Jail, by the attorney in fact of the
owner, or the sum of $250 for the man alone, or $150 for the
woman and three children alone.

WM. W. HALL, for the Attorney, feb. 1.
</code></pre><p>Years before her escape, her mistress died in England; and as Rebecca had always understood, long before this event, that all the slaves were to be freed at the death of her mistress, she was not prepared to believe any other report. It turned out, however, as in thousands of other instances, that no will could be found, and, of course, the administrators retained the slave property, regardless of any verbal expressions respecting freeing, etc. Rebecca closely watched the course of the administrators, and in the meanwhile firmly resolved, that neither she nor her children should ever serve another master. Rather than submit, she declared that she would take the lives of her children and then her own. Notwithstanding her bold and decided stand, the report went out that she was to be sold, and that all the slaves were still to be held in bondage. Rebecca&#39;s sympathizers and friends advised her, as they thought for the best, to get a friend or gentleman to purchase her for herself. To this she replied: &quot;Not three cents would I give, nor do I want any of my friends to buy me, not if they could get me for three cents. It would be of no use,&quot; she contended, &quot;as she was fully bent on dying, rather than remain a slave.&quot; The slave-holders evidently understood her, and were in no hurry about bringing her case to an issue--they rather gave her time to become calm. But Rebecca was inflexible.</p><p>Six years before her arrival, her husband had escaped, in company with the noted fugitive, &quot;Shadrach.&quot; For a time after he fled, she frequently received letters from him, but for a long while he had ceased to write, and of late she had heard nothing from him.</p><p>In escaping stowed away in the boat, she suffered terribly, but faithfully endured to the end, and was only too happy when the agony was over. After resting and getting thoroughly refreshed in Philadelphia, she, with others, was forwarded to Boston, for her heart was there. Several letters were received from her, respecting her prospects, etc., from which it appears that she had gained some knowledge of her husband, although not of a satisfactory nature. At any rate she decided that she could not receive him back again. The following letter has reference to her prospects, going to California, her husband, etc.:</p><pre><code>PARKER HOUSE, School street, Boston, Oct. 18th, &#39;56.

MY DEAR SIR:--I can hardly express the pleasure I feel at the
receipt of your kind letter; but allow me to thank you for the
same.

And now I will tell you my reasons for going to California. Mrs.
Tarrol, a cousin of my husband, has sent for me. She says I can
do much better there than in Boston. And as I have my children&#39;s
welfare to look to, I have concluded to go. Of course I shall be
just as likely to hear from home _there_ as _here_. Please tell
Mr. Bagnale I shall expect one letter from him before I leave
here.

I should like to hear from my brothers and sisters once more,
and let me hear every particular. You never can know how anxious
I am to hear from them; do please impress this upon their minds.

I have written two letters to Dr. Lundy and never received an
answer. I heard Mrs. Lundy was dead, and thought that might
possibly be the reason he had not replied to me. Please tell the
Doctor I should take it as a great favor if he would write me a
few lines.

I suppose you think I am going to live with my husband again.
Let me assure you &#39;tis no such thing. My mind is as firm as
ever. And believe me, in going away from Boston, I am going away
from him, for I have heard he is living somewhere near. He has
been making inquiries about me, but that can make no difference
in my feelings to him. I hope that yourself, wife and family are
all quite well. Please remember me to them all. Do me the favor
to give my love to all inquiring friends. I should be most happy
to have any letters of introduction you may think me worthy of,
and I trust I shall ever remain

Yours faithfully,

REBECCA JONES.

P.S.--I do not know if I shall go this Fall, or in the Spring.
It will depend upon the letter I receive from California, but
whichever it may be, I shall be happy to hear from you very
soon.
</code></pre><p>Isaiah, who was a fellow-servant with Rebecca, and was included in the reward offered by Hall for Rebecca, etc., was a young man about twenty-three years of age, a mulatto, intelligent and of prepossessing manners. A purely ardent thirst for liberty prompted him to flee; although he declared that he had been treated very badly, and had even suffered severely from being shamefully &quot;beaten.&quot; He had, however, been permitted to hire his time by the year, for which one hundred and twenty dollars were regularly demanded by his owner. Young as he was, he was a married man, with a wife and two children, to whom he was devoted. He had besides two brothers and two sisters for whom he felt a warm degree of brotherly affection; yet when the hour arrived for him to accept a chance for freedom at the apparent sacrifice of these dearest ties of kindred, he was found heroic enough for this painful ordeal, and to give up all for freedom.</p><p>Caroline Taylor, and her two little children, were also from Norfolk, and came by boat. Upon the whole, they were not less interesting than Rebecca Jones and her three little girls. Although Caroline was not in her person half so stately, nor gave such promise of heroism as Rebecca--for Caroline was rather small of stature--yet she was more refined, and quite as intelligent as Rebecca, and represented considerably more of the Anglo-Saxon blood. She was a mulatto, and her children were almost fair enough to pass for white--probably they were quadroons, hardly any one would have suspected that they had only one quarter of colored blood in their veins. For ten years Caroline had been in the habit of hiring her time at the rate of seventy-five dollars per year, with the exception of the last year, when her hire was raised to eighty-four dollars. So anxious was she to have her older girl (eleven years old) at home with her, that she also hired her time by the year, for which she was compelled to pay twenty-four dollars. As her younger child was not sufficiently grown to hire out for pay, she was permitted to have it at home with her on the conditions that she would feed, clothe and take good care of it, permitting no expense whatever to fall upon the master.</p><p>Judging from the appearance and manners of the children, their mother had, doubtless, been most faithful to them, for more handsome, well-behaved, intelligent and pleasing children could not easily be selected from either race or any station of life. The younger, Mary by name, nine years of age, attracted very great attention, by the deep interest she manifested in a poor fugitive (whom she had never seen before), at the Philadelphia station, confined to the bed and suffering excruciating pain from wounds he had received whilst escaping. Hours and hours together, during the two or three days of their sojourn, she spent of her own accord, by his bed-side, manifesting almost womanly sympathy in the most devoted and tender manner. She thus, doubtless, unconsciously imparted to the sufferer a great deal of comfort. Very many affecting incidents had come under the observation of the acting Committee, under various circumstances, but never before had they witnessed a sight more interesting, a scene more touching.</p><p>Caroline and her children were owned by Peter March, Esq., late of Norfolk, but at that time, he was living in New York, and was carrying on the iron business. He came into possession of them through his wife, who was the daughter of Caroline&#39;s former master, and almost the only heir left, in consequence of the terrible fever of the previous summer. Caroline was living under the daily fear of being sold; this, together with the task of supporting herself and two children, made her burden very grievous. Not a great while before her escape, her New York master had been on to Norfolk, expressly with a view of selling her, and asked two thousand dollars for her. This, however, he failed to get, and was still awaiting an offer.</p><p>These ill omens aroused Caroline to think more seriously over the condition of herself and children than she had ever done before, and in this state of mind she came to the conclusion, that she would strive to save herself and children by flight on the Underground Rail Road. She knew full well, that it was no faint-hearted struggle that was required of her, so she had nerved herself with the old martyr spirit to risk her all on her faith in God and Freedom, and was ready to take the consequences if she fell back into the hands of the enemy. This noble decision was the crowning act in the undertakings of thousands similarly situated. Through this faith she gained the liberty of herself and her children. Quite a number of the friends of the slave saw these interesting fugitives, and wept, and rejoiced with them.</p><p>Col. A. Cammings, in those days Publisher of the &quot;Evening Bulletin,&quot; for the first time, witnessed an Underground Rail Road arrival. Some time previous, in conversation with Mr. J.M. McKim, the Colonel had expressed views not altogether favorable to the Underground Rail Road; indeed he was rather inclined to apologize for slavery, if not to defend the Fugitive Slave Law. While endeavoring somewhat tenaciously to maintain his ground, Mr. McKim opposed to him not only the now well established Anti-Slavery doctrines, but also offered as testimony Underground Rail Road facts--the results of personal knowledge from daily proofs of the heroic struggles, marvellous faith, and intense earnestness of the fugitives.</p><p>In all probability the Colonel did not feel prepared to deny wholly Mr. McKim&#39;s statement, yet, he desired to see &quot;some&quot; for himself. &quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. McK., &quot;you shall see some.&quot; So when this arrival came to hand, true to his promise, Mr. McK. called on the Colonel and invited him to accompany him to the Underground Rail Road station. He assured the Colonel that he did not want any money from him, but simply wanted to convince him of his error in the recent argument that they had held on the subject. Accordingly the Colonel accompanied him, and found that twenty-two passengers had been on hand within the past twenty-four hours, and at least sixteen or seventeen were then in his presence. It is needless to say, that such a sight admitted of no contradiction--no argument--no doubt. The facts were too self-evident. The Colonel could say but little, so complete was his amazement; but he voluntarily attested the thoroughness of his conversion by pulling out of his pocket and handing to Mr. McK. a twenty dollar gold piece to aid the passengers on to freedom.</p><p>In these hours of rest and joyful anticipation the necessities of both large and small were administered to according to their needs, before forwarding them still further. The time and attention required for so many left but little opportunity, however, for the Secretary to write their narratives. He had only evening leisure for the work. Ten or twelve of that party had to be sent off without having their stories recorded. Daniel Robertson was one of this number; his name is simply entered on the roll, and, but for letters received from him, after he passed on North, no further knowledge would have been obtained. In Petersburg, whence he escaped, he left his wife, for whose deliverance he felt bound to do everything that lay in his power, as the subjoined letters will attest:</p><pre><code>HAVANA, August 11, 1856, Schuylkill Co., N.Y.

MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I came from Virginia in March, and was
at your office the last of March. My object in writing you, is
to inquire what I can do, or what can be done to help my wife to
escape from the same bondage that I was in. You will know by
your books that I was from Petersburg, Va., and that is where my
wife now is. I have received two or three letters from a lady in
that place, and the last one says, that my wife&#39;s mistress is
dead, and that she expects to be sold. I am very anxious to do
what I can for her before it is too late, and beg of you to
devise some means to get her away. Capt. the man that brought me
away, knows the colored agent at Petersburg, and knows he will
do all he can to forward my wife. The Capt. promised, that when
I could raise one hundred dollars for him that he would deliver
her in Philadelphia. Tell him that I can now raise the money,
and will forward it to you at any day that he thinks that he can
bring her. Please see the Captain and find when he will
undertake it, and then let me know when to forward the money to
you. I am at work for the Hon. Charles Cook, and can send the
money any day. My wife&#39;s name is Harriet Robertson, and the
agent at Petersburg knows her.

Please direct your answer, with all necessary directions, to N.
Coryell, of this village, and he will see that all is right.

Very respectfully,

DANIEL ROBERTSON.





HAVANA, Aug. 18, 1856.

MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--Yours of the 18th, for D. Robertson,
was duly received. In behalf of Daniel, I thank you kindly for
the interest you manifest in him. The letters that have gone
from him to his friends in Virginia, have been written by me,
and sent in such a manner as we thought would best ensure
safety. Yet I am well aware of the risk of writing, and have
restrained him as far as possible, and the last one I wrote was
to be the last, till an effort was made to reclaim his wife.
Daniel is a faithful, likely man, and is well liked by all who
know him. He is industrious and prudent, and is bending his
whole energies toward the reclaiming his wife. He can forward to
you the one hundred dollars at any day that it may be wanted,
and if you can do anything to forward his interests it will be
very gratefully received as an additional favor on your part. He
asks for no money, but your kindly efforts, which he regards
more highly than money.

Very respectfully, N. CORYELL.

The letters that have been written for him were dated &quot;Niagara
Falls, Canada West,&quot; and his friends think he is there--none of
them know to the contrary--it is important that they never do
know. N.C.





HAVANA, Sept. 29, 1856.

MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I enclose herewith a draft on New
York, payable to your order, for $100, to be paid on the
delivery at Philadelphia of Daniel Robertson&#39;s wife.

You can readily see that it has been necessary for Daniel to
work almost night and day to have laid up so large an amount of
money, since the first of April, as this one hundred dollars.
Daniel is industrious and prudent, and saves all of his
earnings, above his most absolute wants. If the Captain is not
successful in getting Daniel&#39;s wife, you, of course, will return
the draft, without charge, as you said. I hope success will
attend him, for Daniel deserves to be rewarded, if ever man did.
Yours, &amp;c.

N. CORYELL.





HAVANA, Jan. 2, 1857.

DEAR SIR:--Your favor containing draft on N. York, for Daniel
Robertson, came to hand on the 31st ult. Daniel begs to tender
his acknowledgments for your kind interest manifested in his
behalf, and says he hopes you will leave no measure untried
which has any appearance of success, and that the money shall be
forthcoming at a moment&#39;s notice. Daniel thinks that since
Christmas, the chances for his wife&#39;s deliverance are fewer than
before, for at that time he fears she was disposed of and
possibly went South.

The paper sent me, with your well-written article, was received,
and on reading it to Daniel, he knew some of the parties
mentioned in it--he was much pleased to hear it read. Daniel
spent New Year&#39;s in Elmira, about 18 miles from this place, and
there he met two whom he was well acquainted with.

Yours, &amp;c.,

N. CORYELL.

WM. STILL, Esq., Phila.
</code></pre><p>Such devotion to freedom, such untiring labor, such appeals as these letters contained awakened deep interest in the breasts of Daniel&#39;s new friends, which spoke volumes in favor of the Slave and against slave-holders. But, alas, nothing could be done to relieve the sorrowing mind of poor Daniel for the deliverance of his wife in chains. The Committee sympathized deeply with him, but could do no more. What other events followed, in Daniel&#39;s life as a fugitive, were never made known to the Committee.</p><p>Arthur Spence also deserves a notice. He was from North Carolina, about twenty-four years of age, and of pleasing appearance, and was heart and soul in sympathy with the cause of the Underground Rail Road. In North Carolina he declared that he had been heavily oppressed by being compelled to pay $175 per annum for his hire. In order to get rid of this heavy load, by shrewd management he gained access to the kind-hearted Captain and procured an Underground Rail Road ticket. In leaving bondage, he was obliged to leave his mother, two brothers and one sister. He appeared to be composed of just the kind of material for making a good British subject.</p><p>Ben Dickinson. Ben was also a slave in North Carolina--located at Eatontown, being the property of &quot;Miss Ann Blunt, who was very hard.&quot; In slave property Miss Blunt was interested to the number of about &quot;ninety head.&quot; She was much in the habit of hiring out servants, and in thus disposing of her slaves Ben thought she was a great deal more concerned in getting good prices for herself than good places for them. Indeed he declared that &quot;she did not care how mean the place was, if she could only get her price.&quot; For three years Ben had Canada and the Underground Rail Road in view, having been &quot;badly treated.&quot; At last the long-looked for time arrived, and he conferred neither with master nor mistress, but &quot;picked himself up&quot; and &quot;took out.&quot; Age twenty-eight, medium size, quite dark, a good carpenter, and generally intelligent. Left two sisters, etc.</p><p>Of this heroic and promising party we can only mention, in conclusion, one more passenger, namely:</p><p>Tom Page. At the time of his arrival, his name only was enrolled on the book. Yet he was not a passenger soon to be forgotten--he was but a mere boy, probably eighteen years of age; but a more apt, ready-witted, active, intelligent and self-reliant fellow is not often seen.</p><p>Judging from his smartness, under slavery, with no chances, it was easy to imagine how creditably he might with a white boy&#39;s chances have climbed the hill of art and science. Obviously he had intellect enough, if properly cultivated, to fill any station within the ordinary reach of intelligent American citizens. He could read and write remarkably well for a slave, and well did he understand his advantages in this particular; indeed if slave-holders had only been aware of the growing tendency of Tom&#39;s mind, they would have rejoiced at hearing of his departure for Canada; he was a most dangerous piece of property to be growing up amongst slaves.</p><p>After leaving the Committee and going North his uncaged mind felt the need of more education, and at the same time he was eager to make money, and do something in life. As he had no one to depend on, parents and relatives being left behind in Norfolk, he felt that he must rely upon himself, young as he was. He first took up his abode in Boston, or New Bedford, where most of the party with whom he escaped went, and where he had an aunt, and perhaps some other distant kin. There he worked and was a live young man indeed--among the foremost in ideas and notions about freedom, etc., as many letters from him bore evidence. After spending a year or more in Massachusetts, he had a desire to see how the fugitives were doing in Upper and Lower Canada, and if any better chances existed in these parts for men of his stamp.</p><p>Some of his letters, from different places, gave proof of real thought and close observation, but they were not generally saved, probably were loaned to be read by friendly eyes. Nevertheless the two subjoined will, in a measure, suffice to give some idea of his intelligence, etc.</p><pre><code>BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 25th, 1857.

WILLIAM STILL, Esq.:--Dear Sir--I have not heard from you for

NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Oct. 6th, &#39;58.

DEAR SIR:--I received your kind letter and I was very glad to
hear from you and your family. This leaves me well, and I hope
when this comes to hand it may find you the same. I have seen a
large number of your U.G.R.R. friends in my travels through the
Eastern as well as the Western States. Well there are a good
many from my own city who I know--some I talk to on private
matters and some I wont. Well around here there are so
many--Tom, Dick and Harry--that you do not know who your friend
is. So it don&#39;t hurt any one to be careful. Well, somehow or
another, I do not like Canada, or the Provinces. I have been to
St. John, N.B., Lower Province, or Lower Canada, also St.
Catharines, C.W., and all around the Canada side, and I do not
like it at all. The people seem to be so queer--though I suppose
if I had of went to Canada when I first came North to live, I
might like it by this time. I was home when Aunt had her
Ambro-type taken for you. She often speaks of your kindness to
her. There are a number of your friends wishes you well. My
little brother is going to school in Boston. The lady, Mrs.
Hillard, that my Aunt lives with, thinks a good deal of him. He
is very smart and I think, if he lives, he may be of some
account. Do you ever see my old friend, Capt. Fountain? Please
to give my love to him, and tell him to come to Boston, as there
are a number of his friends that would like to see him. My best
respects to all friends. I must now bring my short epistle to a
close, by saying I remain your friend truly,

</code></pre><p>While a portion of the party, on hand with him, came as passengers with Capt. P., another portion was brought by Capt. B., both parties arriving within twelve hours of each other; and both had likewise been frozen up on the route for weeks with their respective live freight on board.</p><p>The sufferings for food, which they were called upon to endure, were beyond description. They happened to have plenty of salt fat pork, and perhaps beans, Indian meal and some potatoes for standing dishes; the more delicate necessaries did not probably last longer than the first or second week of their ice-bondage.</p><p>Without a doubt, one of these Captains left Norfolk about the twentieth of January, but did not reach Philadelphia till about the twentieth of March, having been frozen up, of course, during the greater part of that time. Men, women and children were alike sharers in the common struggle for freedom--were alike an hungered, in prison, naked, and sick, but it was a fearful thing in those days for even women and children to whisper their sad lamentations in the city of Philadelphia, except to those friendly to the Underground Rail Road.</p><p>Doubtless, if these mothers, with their children and partners in tribulation, could have been seen as they arrived direct from the boats, many hearts would have melted, and many tears would have found their way down many cheeks. But at that time cotton was acknowledged to be King--the Fugitive Slave Law was supreme, and the notorious decision of Judge Taney, that &quot;black men had no rights which white men were bound to respect,&quot; echoed the prejudices of the masses too clearly to have made it safe to reveal the fact of their arrival, or even the heart-rending condition of these Fugitives.</p><p>Nevertheless, they were not turned away empty, though at a peril they were fed, aided, and comforted, and sent away well clothed. Indeed, so bountifully were the women and children supplied, that as they were being conveyed to the Camden and Amboy station, they looked more like a pleasuring party than like fugitives. Some of the good friends of the slave sent clothing, and likewise cheered them with their presence.</p><p>[Before the close of this volume, such friends and sympathizers will be more particularly noticed in an appropriate place.]</p><pre><code>   *       *       *       *       *

The heavy bonds of Slavery made him miserable. He was a man of much natural ability, quite dark, well-made, and said that he had been &quot;worked very hard.&quot; According to his statement, he had been an &quot;acceptable preacher in the African Methodist Church,&quot; and was also &quot;respected by the respectable white and colored people in his neighborhood.&quot; He would not have escaped but for fear of being sold, as he had a wife and five children to whom he was very much attached, but had to leave them behind. Fortunately they were free.</p><p>Of his ministry and connection with the Church, he spoke with feelings of apparent solemnity, evidently under the impression that the little flock he left would be without a shepherd. Of his master, Captain Samuel Le Count, of the U.S. Navy, he had not one good word to speak; at least nothing of the kind is found on the Record Book; but, on the contrary, he declared that &quot;he was very hard on his servants, allowing them no chance whatever to make a little ready money for themselves.&quot; So in turning his face towards the Underground Rail Road, and his back against slavery, he felt that he was doing God service.</p><p>The Committee regarded him as a remarkable man, and was much impressed with his story, and felt it to be a privilege and a pleasure to aid him.</p><p>Lewis Francis was a man of medium size, twenty-seven years of age, good-looking and intelligent. He stated that he belonged to Mrs. Delinas, of Abingdon, Harford Co., Md., but that he had been hired out from a boy to a barber in Baltimore. For his hire his mistress received eight dollars per month.</p><p>To encourage Lewis, his kind-hearted mistress allowed him out of his own wages the sum of two dollars and fifty cents per annum! His clothing he got as best he could, but nothing did she allow him for that purpose. Even with this arrangement she had been dissatisfied of late years, and thought she was not getting enough out of Lewis; she, therefore, talked strongly of selling him. This threat was very annoying to Lewis, so much so, that he made up his mind that he would one day let her see, that so far as he was concerned, it was easier to talk of selling than it would be to carry out her threat.</p><p>With this growing desire for freedom he gained what little light he could on the subject of traveling, Canada, etc., and at a given time off he started on his journey and found his way to the Committee, who imparted substantial aid as usual.</p><p>Alexander Munson, alias Samuel Garrett. This candidate for Canada was only eighteen years of age; a well-grown lad, however, and had the one idea that &quot;all men were born free&quot; pretty deeply rooted in his mind. He was quite smart, and of a chestnut color. By the will of his original owner, the slaves were all entitled to their freedom, but it appeared, from Alexander&#39;s story, that the executor of the estate did not regard this freedom clause in the will. He had already sold some of the slaves, and others--he among them--were expecting to be sold before coming into possession of their freedom. Two of them had been sold to Alabama, therefore, with these evil warnings, young Alexander resolved to strike out at once for Canada, despite Maryland slave-holders. With this bold and manly spirit he succeeded, of course.</p><p>Anna Scott and husband, Samuel Scott. This couple escaped from Cecil Cross-Roads, Md. The wife, in this instance, evidently took the lead, and acted the more manly part in striking for freedom; therefore, our notice of this arrival will chiefly relate to her..</p><p>Anna was owned by a widow, named Mrs. Ann Elizabeth Lushy, who resided on a farm of her own. Fifteen slaves, with other stock, were kept on the place. She was accustomed to rule with severity, being governed by a &quot;high temper,&quot; and in nowise disposed to allow her slaves to enjoy even ordinary privileges, and besides, would occasionally sell to the Southern market. She was calculated to render slave life very unhappy. Anna portrayed her mistress&#39;s treatment of the slaves with much earnestness, especially when referring to the sale of her own brother and sister. Upon the whole, the mistress was so hateful to Anna, that she resolved not to live in the house with her. During several years prior to her escape, Anna had been hired out, where she had been treated a little more decently than her mistress was wont to do; on this account she was less willing to put up with any subsequent abuse from her mistress.</p><p>To escape was the only remedy, so she made up her mind, that she would leave at all hazards. She gave her husband to understand, that she had resolved to seek a home in Canada. Fortunately, he was free, but slavery had many ways of putting the yoke on the colored man, even though he might be free; it was bound to keep him in ignorance, and at the same time miserably abject, so that he would scarcely dare to look up in the presence of white people.</p><p>Sam, apparently, was one of the number who had been greatly wronged in this particular. He had less spirit than his wife, who had been directly goaded to desperation. He agreed, however, to stand by her in her struggles while fleeing, and did so, for which he deserves credit. It must be admitted, that it required some considerable nerve for a free man even to join his wife in an effort of this character. In setting out, Anna had to leave her father (Jacob Trusty), seven sisters and two brothers. The names of the sisters were as follows: Emeline, Susan Ann, Delilah, Mary Eliza, Rosetta, Effie Ellender and Elizabeth; the brothers--Emson and Perry. For the commencement of their journey they availed themselves of the Christmas holidays, but had to suffer from the cold weather they encountered. Yet they got along tolerably well, and were much cheered by the attention and aid they received from the Committee.</p><p>William Henry Laminson came from near Newcastle, Delaware. He was smart enough to take advantage of the opportunity to escape at the age of twenty-one. As he had given the matter his fullest attention for a long time, he was prepared to make rapid progress when he did start, and as he had no great distance to travel it is not unlikely, that while his master was one night sleeping soundly, this young piece of property (worth at least $1,000 in the market), was crossing Mason and Dixon&#39;s Line, and steering directly for Canada. Francis Harkins was the name of the master. William did not give him a very bad character.</p><p>George Washington Gooseberry, alias Isaac Stout, also took advantage of the holidays to separate from his old master, Anthony Rybold, a farmer living near Newcastle, Delaware. Nothing but the desire to be free moved George to escape. He was a young man about twenty-three years of age, of a pure black color, in stature, medium size, and well-made. Nothing remarkable is noted in the book in any way connected with his life or escape.</p><p>Caroline Graves. Caroline was of the bond class belonging to the State of Maryland. Having reached the age of forty without being content, and seeing no bright prospect in the future, she made up her mind to break away from the bonds of Slavery and seek a more congenial atmosphere among strangers in Canada. She had had the privilege of trying two masters in her life-time; the first she admitted was &quot;kind&quot; to her, but the latter was &quot;cruel.&quot; After arriving in Canada, she wrote back as follows:</p><pre><code>TORONTO, Jan. 22, 1856.

</code></pre><p>George Graham and wife, Jane, alias Henry Washington and Eliza. The cold weather of January was preferred, in this instance, for traveling. Indeed matters were so disagreeable with them that they could not tarry in their then quarters any longer. George was twenty-four years of age, quite smart, pleasant countenance, and of dark complexion.</p><p>He had experienced &quot;rough usage&quot; all the way along through life, not unfrequently from severe floggings. Twice, within the last year, he had been sold. In order to prevent a renewal of these inflictions he resorted to the Underground Rail Road with his wife, to whom he had only been married six months.</p><p>In one sense, they appeared to be in a sad condition, it being the dead of winter, but their condition in Alexandria, under a brutal master and mistress which both had the misfortune to have, was much sadder. To give all their due, however, George&#39;s wife acknowledged, that she had been &quot;well treated under her old mistress,&quot; but through a change, she had fallen into the hands of a &quot;new one,&quot; by whom her life had been rendered most &quot;miserable;&quot; so much so, that she was willing to do almost anything to get rid of her, and was, therefore, driven to join her husband in running away.</p><p>Henry Chambers, John Chambers, Samuel Fall, and Jonathan Fisher. This party represented the more promising-looking field-hand slave population of Maryland. Henry and John were brothers, twenty-four and twenty-six years of age, stout made, chestnut color, good-looking, but in height not quite medium. Henry &quot;owed service or labor,&quot; to a fellow-man by the name of William Rybold, a farmer living near Sassafras Neck, Md. Henry evidently felt, that he did master Rybold no injustice in testifying that he knew no good of him, although he had labored under him like a beast of burden all his days. He had been &quot;clothed meanly,&quot; and &quot;poorly fed.&quot; He also alleged, that his mistress was worse than his master, as she would &quot;think nothing of knocking and beating the slave women for nothing.&quot; John was owned by Thomas Murphy. From that day to this, Thomas may have been troubling his brain to know why his man John treated him so shabbily as to leave him in the manner that he did. Jack had a good reason for his course, nevertheless. In his corn field-phrase he declared, that his master Murphy would not give you half clothes, and besides he was a &quot;hard man,&quot; who kept Jack working out on hire. Therefore, feeling his wrongs keenly, Jack decided, with his other friends, to run off and be free.</p><p>Sam, another comrade, was also owned by William Rybold. Sam had just arrived at his maturity (twenty-one), when he was invited to join in the plot to escape. At first, it might be thought strange, why one so young should seek to escape. A few brief words from Sam soon explained the mystery. It was this: his master, as he said, had been in the habit of tying him up by the hands and flogging him unmercifully; besides, in the allowance of food and clothing, he always &quot;stinted the slaves yet worked them very hard.&quot; Sam&#39;s chances for education had been very unfavorable, but he had mind enough to know that liberty was worth struggling for. He was willing to make the trial with the other boys. He was of a dark chestnut color, and of medium size.</p><p>Jonathan belonged to A. Rybold, and was only nineteen years of age. All that need be said in relation to his testimony, is, that it agreed with his colleague&#39;s and fellow-servant&#39;s, Samuel. Before starting on their journey, they felt the need of new names, and in putting their wits together, they soon fixed this matter by deciding to pass in future by the following names: James and David Green, John Henry, and Jonathan Fisher.</p><p>In the brief sketches given in this chapter, some lost ones, seeking information of relatives, may find comfort, even if the general reader should fail to be interested.</p><p>PART OF THE ARRIVALS IN DECEMBER, 1855.</p><p>THOMAS JERVIS GOOSEBERRY and WILLIAM THOMAS FREEMAN, <em>alias</em> EZEKIEL CHAMBERS; HENRY HOOPER; JACOB HALL, <em>alias</em> HENRY THOMAS, and wife, HENRIETTA and child; Two men from near Chestertown, Md.; FENTON JONES; MARY CURTIS; WILLIAM BROWN; CHARLES HENRY BROWN; OLIVER PURNELL and ISAAC FIDGET.</p><p>Thomas Jervis Gooseberry and William Thomas Freeman. The coming of this party was announced in the subjoined letter:</p><pre><code>SCHUYLKILL, 11th Mo., 29th, 1855.

WILLIAM STILL: DEAR FRIEND:--Those boys will be along by the
last Norristown train to-morrow evening. I think the train
leaves Norristown at 6 o&#39;clock, but of this inform thyself. The
boys will be sent to a friend at Norristown, with instructions
to assist them in getting seats in the last train that leaves
Norristown to-morrow evening. They are two of the eleven who
left some time since, and took with them some of their master&#39;s
horses; I have told them to remain in the cars at Green street
until somebody meets them.

E.F. PENNYPACKER.
</code></pre><p>Having arrived safely, by the way and manner indicated in E.F. Pennypacker&#39;s note, as they were found to be only sixteen and seventeen years of age, considerable interest was felt by the Acting Committee to hear their story. They were closely questioned in the usual manner. They proved to be quite intelligent, considering how young they were, and how the harrow of Slavery had been upon them from infancy.</p><p>They escaped from Chestertown, Md., in company with nine others (they being a portion of the eleven who arrived in Wilmington, with two carriages, etc., noticed on page 302), but, for prudential reasons they were separated while traveling. Some were sent on, but the boys had to be retained with friends in the country. Many such separations were inevitable. In this respect a great deal of care and trouble had to be endured for the sake of the cause.</p><p>Thomas Jervis, the elder boy, was quite dark, and stammered somewhat, yet he was active and smart. He stated that Sarah Maria Perkins was his mistress in Maryland. He was disposed to speak rather favorably of her, at least he said that she was &quot;tolerably kind&quot; to her servants. She, however, was in the habit of hiring out, to reap a greater revenue for them, and did not always get them places where they were treated as well as she herself treated them. Tom left his father, Thomas Gooseberry, and three sisters, Julia Ann, Mary Ellen, and Katie Bright, all slaves.</p><p>Ezekiel, the younger boy, was of a chestnut color, clever-looking, smart, and well-grown, just such an one as a father enjoying the blessings of education and citizenship, might have felt a considerable degree of pride in. He was owned by a man called John Dwa, who followed &quot;farming and drinking,&quot; and when under the influence of liquor, was disposed to ill-treat the slaves. Ezekiel had not seen his mother for many years, although she was living in Baltimore, and was known by the name of &quot;Dorcas Denby.&quot; He left no brothers nor sisters.</p><p>The idea of boys, so young and inexperienced as they were, being thrown on the world, gave occasion for serious reflection. Still the Committee were rejoiced that they were thus early in life, getting away from the &quot;Sum of all villanies.&quot; In talking with them, the Committee endeavored to impress them with right ideas as to how they should walk in life, aided them, of course, and sent them off with a double share of advice. What has been their destiny since, is not known.</p><p>Henry Hooper, a young man of nineteen years of age, came from Maryland, in December, in a subsequent Underground Rail Road arrival. That he came in good order, and was aided and sent off, was fully enough stated on the book, but nothing else; space, however was left for the writing out of his narrative, but it was never filled up. Probably the loose sheet on which the items were jotted down, was lost.</p><p>Jacob Hall, alias Henry Thomas, wife Henrietta, and child, were also among the December passengers. On the subject of freedom they were thoroughly converted. Although Jacob was only about twenty years of age, he had seen enough of Slavery under his master, &quot;Major William Hutchins,&quot; whom he described as a &quot;farmer, commissioner, drunkard, and hard master,&quot; to know that no hope could be expected from him, but if he remained, he would daily have to be under the &quot;harrow.&quot; The desire to work for himself was so strong, that he could not reconcile his mind to the demands of Slavery. While meditating upon freedom, he concluded to make an effort with his wife and child to go to Canada.</p><p>His wife, Henrietta, who was then owned by a woman named Sarah Ann McGough, was as unhappily situated as himself. Indeed Henrietta had come to the conclusion, that it was out of the question for a servant to please her mistress, it mattered not how hard she might try; she also said, that her mistress drank, and that made her &quot;wus.&quot;</p><p>Besides, she had sold Henrietta&#39;s brother and sister, and was then taking steps to sell her,--had just had her appraised with this view. It was quite easy, therefore, looking at their condition in the light of these plain facts, for both husband and wife to agree, that they could not make their condition any worse, even if they should be captured in attempting to escape. Henrietta also remembered, that years before her mother had escaped, and got off to Canada, which was an additional encouragement. Thus, as her own faith was strengthened, she could strengthen that of her husband.</p><p>Their little child they resolved to cling to through thick and thin; so, in order that they might not have so far to carry him, father and mother each bridled a horse and &quot;took out&quot; in the direction of the first Underground Rail Road station. Their faithful animals proved of incalculable service, but they were obliged to turn them loose on the road without even having the opportunity or pleasure of rewarding them with a bountiful feed of oats.</p><p>Although they had strange roads, woods and night scenes to pass through, yet they faltered not. They found friends and advisers on the road, however, and reached the Committee in safety, who was made to rejoice that such promising-looking &quot;property&quot; could come out of Ladies&#39; Manor, Maryland. The Committee felt that they had acted wisely in taking the horses to assist them the first night.</p><p>The next arrival is recorded thus: &quot;Dec. 10, 1855, Arrived, two men from near Chestertown, Md. They came to Wilmington in a one horse wagon, and through aid of T.G. they were sent on.&quot; (Further account at the time, written on a loose piece of paper, is among the missing).</p><p>Fenton Jones escaped from Frederick, Md. After arriving in the neighborhood of Ereildoun, Pa., he was induced to tarry awhile for the purpose of earning means to carry him still farther. But he was soon led to apprehend danger, and was advised and directed to apply to the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia for the needed aid, which he did, and was dispatched forthwith to Canada.</p><p>About the same time a young woman arrived, calling herself Mary Curtis. She was from Baltimore, and was prompted to escape to keep from being sold. She was nineteen years of age, small size, dark complexion. No special incidents in her life were noted.</p><p>William Brown came next. If others had managed to make their way out of the prison-house without great difficulties, it was far from William to meet with such good luck, as he had suffered excessively for five weeks while traveling. It was an easy matter for a traveler to get lost, not knowing the roads, nor was it safe to apply to a stranger for information or direction--therefore, in many instances, the journey would either have to be given up, or be prosecuted, suffering almost to the death.</p><p>In the trying circumstances in which William found himself, dark as everything looked, he could not consent to return to his master, as he felt persuaded, that if he did, there would be no rest on earth for him. He well remembered, that, because he had resisted being flogged (being high spirited), his master had declined to sell him for the express purpose of making an example of him--as a warning to the other slaves on the place. William was as much opposed to being thus made use of as he was to being flogged. His reflections and his stout heart enabled him to endure five weeks of severe suffering while fleeing from oppression. Of course, when he did succeed, the triumph was unspeakably joyous. Doubtless, he had thought a great deal during this time, and being an intelligent fugitive, he interested the Committee greatly.</p><p>The man that he escaped from was called William Elliott, a farmer, living in Prince George&#39;s county, Md. William Elliott claimed the right to flog and used it too. William, however, gave him the character of being among the moderate slave-holders of that part of the country. This was certainly a charitable view. William was of a chestnut color, well made, and would have commanded, under the &quot;hammer,&quot; a high price, if his apparent intelligence had not damaged him. He left his father, grand-mother, four sisters and two brothers, all living where he fled from.</p><p>Charles Henry Brown. This &quot;chattel&quot; was owned by Dr. Richard Dorsey, of Cambridge, Maryland. Up to twenty-seven years of age, he had experienced and observed how slaves were treated in his neighborhood, and he made up his mind that he was not in favor of the Institution in any form whatever. Indeed he felt, that for a man to put his hand in his neighbor&#39;s pocket and rob him, was nothing compared to the taking of a man&#39;s hard earnings from year to year. Really Charles reasoned the case so well, in his uncultured country phrases, that the Committee was rather surprised, and admired his spirit in escaping. He was a man of not quite medium size, with marked features of mind and character.</p><p>Oliver Purnell and Isaac Fidget arrived from Berlin, Md. Each had different owners. Oliver stated that Mose Purnell had owned him, and that he was a tolerably moderate kind of a slave-holder, although he was occasionally subject to fractious turns. Oliver simply gave as his reason for leaving in the manner that he did, that he wanted his &quot;own earnings.&quot; He felt that he had as good a right to the fruit of his labor as anybody else. Despite all the pro-slavery teachings he had listened to all his life, he was far from siding with the pro-slavery doctrines. He was about twenty-six years of age, chestnut color, wide awake and a man of promise; yet it was sadly obvious that he had been blighted and cursed by slavery even in its mildest forms. He left his parents, two brothers and three sisters all slaves in the hands of Purnell, the master whom he deserted.</p><p>Isaac, his companion, was about thirty years of age, dark, and in intellect about equal to the average passengers on the Underground Rail Road. He had a very lively hope of finding his wife in freedom, she having escaped the previous Spring; but of her whereabouts he was ignorant, as he had had no tidings of her since her departure. A lady by the name of Mrs. Fidget held the deed for Isaac. He spoke kindly of her, as he thought she treated her slaves quite as well at least as the best of slave-holders in his neighborhood. His view was a superficial one, it meant only that they had not been beaten and starved half to death.</p><p>As the heroic adventures and sufferings of Slaves struggling for freedom, shall be read by coming generations, were it not for unquestioned statutes upholding Slavery in its dreadful heinousness, people will hardly be able to believe that such atrocities were enacted in the nineteenth century, under a highly enlightened, Christianized, and civilized government. Having already copied a statute enacted by the State of Virginia, as a sample of Southern State laws, it seems fitting that the Fugitive Slave Bill, enacted by the Congress of the United States, shall be also copied, in order to commemorate that most infamous deed, by which, it may be seen, how great were the bulwarks of oppression to be surmounted by all who sought to obtain freedom by flight.</p><p>THE FUGITIVE SLAVE BILL OF 1850.</p><p>&quot;AN ACT RESPECTING FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE, AND PERSONS ESCAPING FROM THE SERVICE OF THEIR MASTERS.&quot;</p><pre><code>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled:

That the persons who have been, or may hereafter be appointed
commissioners, in virtue of any Act of Congress, by the circuit
courts of the United States, and who, in consequence of such

the United States, and all commissioners, who shall hereafter be
appointed for such purposes, by the superior court of any
organized territory of the United States, shall possess all the

SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, that the commissioners above
named, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the judges of the
circuit and district courts of the United States, in their
respective circuits and districts within the several States, and
the judges of the superior courts of the Territories severally
and collectively, in term time and vacation; and shall grant
certificates to such claimants, upon satisfactory proof being

or fled.

SEC. 5. And be it further enacted: That it shall be the duty of
all marshals and deputy marshals, to obey and execute all
warrants and precepts issued under the provisions of this act,
when to them directed; and should any marshal or deputy marshal
refuse to receive such warrant or other process when tendered,

shall, on conviction thereof, be fined in the sum of one
thousand dollars to the use of such claimant, on the motion of
such claimant by the circuit or district court for the district
of such marshal; and after arrest of such fugitive by the
marshal, or his deputy, or whilst at any time in his custody,
under the provisions of this act, should such fugitive escape,
whether with or without the assent of such marshal or his
deputy, such marshal shall be liable, on his official bond, to
be prosecuted, for the benefit of such claimant, for the full
value of the service or labor of said fugitive in the State,
Territory or district whence he escaped; and the better to
enable the said commissioners, when thus appointed, to execute
their duties faithfully and efficiently, in conformity with the
requirements of the Constitution of the United States, and of
this act, they are hereby authorized and empowered, within their
counties respectively, to appoint in writing under their hands,
any one or more suitable persons, from time to time, to execute
all such warrants and other process as may be issued by them in
the lawful performance of their respective duties, with an
authority to such commissioners, or the persons to be appointed

execution of this law, whenever their services may be required,
as aforesaid, for that purpose; and said warrants shall run and
be executed by said officers anywhere in the State within which
they are issued.

SEC. 6. And be it further enacted, That when a person held to
service or labor in any State or Territory of the United States,
has heretofore, or shall hereafter escape into another State or
Territory of the United States, the person or persons to whom
such service or labor may be due, or his, her or their agent or
attorney, duly authorized, by power of attorney, in writing,
acknowledged and certified under the seal of some legal office
or court of the State or Territory, in which the same may be
executed, may pursue and reclaim such fugitive person, either by
procuring a warrant from some one of the courts, judges, or
commissioners aforesaid, of the proper circuit, district or
county, for the apprehension of such fugitive from service or
labor, or by seizing and arresting such fugitive, where the same
can be done without process, and by taking, or causing such
person to be taken, forthwith, before such court, judge or
commissioner, whose duty it shall be to hear and determine the
case of such claimant in a summary manner, and upon satisfactory
proof being made, by deposition or affidavit, in writing, to be
taken and certified by such court, judge or commissioner, or by
other satisfactory testimony, duly taken and certified by some
court, magistrate, justice of the peace, or other legal officer
authorized to administer an oath and take depositions under the
laws of the State or Territory from which such person owing
service or labor may have escaped, with a certificate of such
magistrate, or other authority, as aforesaid, with the seal of
the proper court or officer thereto attached, which seal shall
be sufficient to establish the competency of the proof, and with
proof also, by affidavit, of the identity of the person whose
service or labor is claimed to be due, as aforesaid, that the
person so arrested does in fact owe service or labor to the
person or persons claiming him or her, in the State or Territory
from which such fugitive may have escaped, as aforesaid, and
that said person escaped, to make out and deliver to such
claimant, his or her agent or attorney, a certificate setting
forth the substantial facts as to the service or labor due from
such fugitive to the claimant, and of his or her escape from the
State or Territory in which such service or labor was due, to
the State or Territory, in which he or she was arrested, with
authority to such claimant, or his or her agent or attorney, to
use such reasonable force and restraint as may be necessary,
under the circumstances of the case, to take and remove such
fugitive person back to the State or Territory from whence he or
she may have escaped, as aforesaid. In no trial or hearing,
under this act, shall the testimony of such alleged fugitives be
admitted in evidence, and the certificates in this and the first
section mentioned, shall be conclusive of the right of the
person or persons in whose favor granted to remove such
fugitives to the State or Territory from which they escaped, and
shall prevent all molestation of said person or persons by any
process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or other person
whomsoever.

SEC. 7. And be it further enacted, That any person who shall
knowingly and willfully obstruct, hinder, or prevent such
claimant, his agent, or attorney, or any person or persons
lawfully assisting him, her or them from arresting such a
fugitive from service or labor, either with or without process,
as aforesaid, or shall rescue, or attempt to rescue, such
fugitive from service or labor, or from the custody of such
claimant, his or her agent, or attorney, or other person or
persons lawfully assisting, as aforesaid, when so arrested,
pursuant to the authority herein given and declared, or shall
aid, abet, or assist such person, so owing service or labor, as
aforesaid, directly or indirectly, to escape from such claimant,
his agent or attorney, or other person or persons legally
authorized, as aforesaid, or shall harbor or conceal such
fugitive, so as to prevent the discovery and arrest of such
person, after notice or knowledge of the fact that such person
was a fugitive from service or labor, as aforesaid, shall, for
either of said offences, be subject to a fine not exceeding one
thousand dollars, and imprisonment not exceeding six months, by
indictment and conviction before the District Court of the
United States, for the district in which such offence may have
been committed, or before the proper court of criminal
jurisdiction, if committed within any one of the organized
Territories of the United States; and shall, moreover, forfeit
and pay, by way of civil damages, to the party injured by such
illegal conduct, the sum of one thousand dollars for each
fugitive so lost, as aforesaid, to be recovered by action of
debt in any of the District or Territorial Courts aforesaid,
within whose jurisdiction the said offence may have been
committed.

SEC. 8. And be it further enacted, That the Marshals, their
deputies, and the clerks of the said districts and territorial
courts, shall be paid for their services the like fees as may be
allowed to them for similar services in other cases; and where
such services are rendered exclusively in the arrest, custody,
and delivery of the fugitives to the claimant, his or her agent,
or attorney, or where such supposed fugitive may be discharged
out of custody from the want of sufficient proof, as aforesaid,
then such fees are to be paid in the whole by such complainant,
his agent or attorney, and in all cases where the proceedings
are before a Commissioner, he shall be entitled to a fee of ten
dollars in full for his services in each case, upon the delivery
of the said certificate to the claimant, his or her agent or
attorney; or a fee of five dollars in cases where proof shall
not, in the opinion of said Commissioner, warrant such
certificate and delivery, inclusive of all services incident to
such arrest and examination, to be paid in either case, by the
claimant, his or her agent or attorney. The person or persons
authorized to execute the process to be issued by such
Commissioners for the arrest and detention of fugitives from
service or labor, as aforesaid, shall also be entitled to a fee
of five dollars each for each person he or they may arrest and
take before any such Commissioners, as aforesaid, at the
instance and request of such claimant, with such other fees as
may be deemed reasonable by such Commissioner for such other
additional services as may be necessarily performed by him or
them; such as attending to the examination, keeping the fugitive
in custody, and providing him with food and lodgings during his
detention, and until the final determination of such
Commissioner; and in general for performing such other duties as
may be required by such claimant, his or her attorney or agent
or commissioner in the premises; such fees to be made up in
conformity with the fees usually charged by the officers of the
courts of justice within the proper district or county as far as
may be practicable, and paid by such claimants, their agents or
attorneys, whether such supposed fugitive from service or labor
be ordered to be delivered to such claimants by the final
determination of such Commissioners or not.

SEC. 9. And be it further enacted, That upon affidavit made by
the claimant of such fugitive, his agent or attorney, after such
certificate has been issued, that he has reason to apprehend
that such fugitive will be rescued by force from his or their
possession before he can be taken beyond the limits of the State
in which the arrest is made, it shall be the duty of the officer
making the arrest to retain such fugitive in his custody, and to
remove him to the State whence he fled, and there to deliver him
to said claimant, his agent or attorney. And to this end the
officer aforesaid is hereby authorized and required to employ so
many persons as he may deem necessary, to overcome such force,
and to retain them in his service so long as circumstances may
require; the said officer and his assistants, while so employed,
to receive the same compensation, and to be allowed the same
expenses as are now allowed by law for the transportation of
criminals, to be certified by the judge of the district within
which the arrest is made, and paid out of the treasury of the
United States.

SEC. 10. And be it further enacted, That when any person held to
service or labor in any State or Territory, or in the District
of Columbia, shall escape therefrom, the party to whom such
service or labor shall be due, his, her, or their agent, or
attorney may apply to any court of record therein, or judge
thereof in vacation, and make such satisfactory proof to such
court or judge in vacation, of the escape aforesaid, and that
the person escaping owed service or labor to such party.
Thereupon the court shall cause a record to be made of the
matters so proved, and also a personal description of the person
so escaping, with such convenient certainty as may be; and a
transcript of such record, authenticated by the attestation of
the clerk, and of the seal of said court being produced in any
other State, Territory or District in which the person so
escaping may be found, and being exhibited to any judge,
commissioner, or other officer authorized by the law of the
United States to cause persons escaping from, service or labor
to be delivered up, shall be held and taken to be full and
conclusive evidence of the fact of escape, and that the service
or labor of the person escaping is due to the party in such
record mentioned. And upon the production, by the said party, of
other and further evidence, if necessary, either oral or by
affidavit, in addition to what is contained in said record of
the identity of the person escaping, he or she shall be
delivered up to the claimant. And said court, commissioners,
judge, or other persons authorized by this act to grant
certificates to claimants of fugitives, shall, upon the
production of the record and other evidence aforesaid, grant to
such claimant a certificate of his right to take any such
person, identified and proved to be owing service or labor as
aforesaid, which certificate shall authorize such claimant to
seize, or arrest, and transport such person to the State or
Territory from which he escaped: Provided, That nothing herein
contained shall be construed as requiring the production of a
transcript of such record as evidence as aforesaid, but in its
absence, the claim shall be heard and determined upon other
satisfactory proofs competent in law.

</code></pre><p>THE SLAVE-HUNTING TRAGEDY IN LANCASTER COUNTY, IN SEPTEMBER, 1851.</p><p>&quot;TREASON AT CHRISTIANA.&quot;</p><p>Having inserted the Fugitive Slave Bill in these records of the Underground Rail Road, one or two slave cases will doubtless suffice to illustrate the effect of its passage on the public mind, and the colored people in particular. The deepest feelings of loathing, contempt and opposition were manifested by the opponents of Slavery on every hand. Anti-slavery papers, lecturers, preachers, etc., arrayed themselves boldly against it on the ground of its inhumanity and violation of the laws of God.</p><p>On the other hand, the slave-holders South, and their pro-slavery adherents in the North demanded the most abject obedience from all parties, regardless of conscience or obligation to God. In order to compel such obedience, as well as to prove the practicability of the law, unbounded zeal daily marked the attempt on the part of slave-holders and slave-catchers to refasten the fetters on the limbs of fugitives in different parts of the North, whither they had escaped.</p><p>In this dark hour, when colored men&#39;s rights were so insecure, as a matter of self-defence, they felt called upon to arm themselves and resist all kidnapping intruders, although clothed with the authority of wicked law. Among the most exciting cases tending to justify this course, the following may be named:</p><p>James Hamlet was the first slave case who was summarily arrested under the Fugitive Slave Law, and sent back to bondage from New York.</p><p>William and Ellen Craft were hotly pursued to Boston by hunters from Georgia.</p><p>Adam Gibson, a free colored man, residing in Philadelphia, was arrested, delivered into the hands of his alleged claimants, by commissioner Edward D. Ingraham, and hurried into Slavery.</p><p>Euphemia Williams (the mother of six living children),--her case excited much interest and sympathy.</p><p>Shadrach was arrested and rescued in Boston.</p><p>Hannah Dellum and her child were returned to Slavery from Philadelphia.</p><p>Thomas Hall and his wife were pounced upon at midnight in Chester county, beaten and dragged off to Slavery, etc.</p><p>And, as if gloating over their repeated successes, and utterly regardless of all caution, about one year after the passage of this nefarious bill, a party of slave-hunters arranged for a grand capture at Christiana.</p><p>One year from the passage of the law, at a time when alarm and excitement were running high, the most decided stand was taken at Christiana, in the State of Pennsylvania, to defeat the law, and defend freedom. Fortunately for the fugitives the plans of the slave-hunters and officials leaked out while arrangements were making in Philadelphia for the capture, and, information being sent to the Anti-slavery office, a messenger was at once dispatched to Christiana to put all persons supposed to be in danger on their guard.</p><p>Among those thus notified, were brave hearts, who did not believe in running away from slave-catchers. They resolved to stand up for the right of self-defence. They loved liberty and hated Slavery, and when the slave-catchers arrived, they were prepared for them. Of the contest, on that bloody morning, we have copied a report, carefully written at the time, by C.M. Burleigh, editor of the &quot;Pennsylvania Freeman,&quot; who visited the scene of battle, immediately after it was over, and doubtless obtained as faithful an account of all the facts in the case, as could then be had.</p><pre><code>&quot;Last Thursday morning, (the 11th inst,), a peaceful
neighborhood in the borders of Lancaster county, was made the
scene of a bloody battle, resulting from an attempt to capture
seven colored men as fugitive slaves. As the reports of the
affray which came to us were contradictory, and having good
reason to believe that those of the daily press were grossly
one-sided and unfair, we repaired to the scene of the tragedy,
and, by patient inquiry and careful examination, endeavored to
learn the real facts. To do this, from the varying and
conflicting statements which we encountered, scarcely two of
which agreed in every point, was not easy; but we believe the
account we give below, as the result of these inquiries, is
substantially correct.

Very early on the 11th inst. a party of slave-hunters went into
a neighborhood about two miles west of Christiana, near the
eastern border of Lancaster county, in pursuit of fugitive
slaves. The party consisted of Edward Gorsuch, his son,
Dickerson Gorsuch, his nephew, Dr. Pearce, Nicholas Hutchins,
and others, all from Baltimore county, Md., and one Henry H.
Kline, a notorious slave-catching constable from Philadelphia,
who had been deputized by Commissioner Ingraham for this
business. At about day-dawn they were discovered lying in an
ambush near the house of one William Parker, a colored man, by
an inmate of the house, who had started for his work. He fled
back to the house, pursued by the slave-hunters, who entered the
lower part of the house, but were unable to force their way into
the upper part, to which the family had retired. A horn was
blown from an upper window; two shots were fired, both, as we
believe, though we are not certain, by the assailants, one at
the colored man who fled into the house, and the other at the
inmates, through the window. No one was wounded by either. A
parley ensued. The slave-holder demanded his slaves, who he said
were concealed in the house. The colored men presented
themselves successively at the window, and asked if they were
the slaves claimed; Gorsuch said, that neither of them was his
slave. They told him that they were the only colored men in the
house, and were determined never to be taken alive as slaves.
Soon the colored people of the neighborhood, alarmed by the
horn, began to gather, armed with guns, axes, corn-cutters, or
clubs. Mutual threatenings were uttered by the two parties. The
slave-holders told the blacks that resistance would be useless,
as they had a party of thirty men in the woods near by. The
blacks warned them again to leave, as they would die before they
would go into Slavery.

From an hour to an hour and a half passed in these parleyings,
angry conversations, and threats; the blacks increasing by new
arrivals, until they probably numbered from thirty to fifty,
most of them armed in some way. About this time, Castner
Hanaway, a white man, and a Friend, who resided in the
neighborhood, rode up, and was soon followed by Elijah Lewis,
another Friend, a merchant, in Cooperville, both gentlemen
highly esteemed as worthy and peaceable citizens. As they came
up, Kline, the deputy marshal, ordered them to aid him, as a
United States officer, to capture the fugitive slaves. They
refused of course, as would any man not utterly destitute of
honor, humanity, and moral principle, and warned the assailants
that it was madness for them to attempt to capture fugitive
slaves there, or even to remain, and begged them if they wished
to save their own lives, to leave the ground. Kline replied, &quot;Do
you really think so?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; was the answer, &quot;the sooner you
leave, the better, if you would prevent bloodshed.&quot; Kline then
left the ground, retiring into a very safe distance into a
cornfield, and toward the woods. The blacks were so exasperated
by his threats, that, but for the interposition of the two white
Friends, it is very doubtful whether he would have escaped
without injury. Messrs. Hanaway and Lewis both exerted their
influence to dissuade the colored people from violence, and
would probably have succeeded in restraining them, had not the
assailing party fired upon them. Young Gorsuch asked his father
to leave, but the old man refused, declaring, as it is said and
believed, that he would &quot;go to hell, or have his slaves.&quot;

Finding they could do nothing further, Hanaway and Lewis both
started to leave, again counselling the slave-hunters to go
away, and the colored people to peace, but had gone but a few
rods, when one of the inmates of the house attempted to come out
at the door. Gorsuch presented his revolver, ordering him back.
The colored man replied, &quot;You had better go away, if you don&#39;t
want to get hurt,&quot; and at the same time pushed him aside and
passed out. Maddened at this, and stimulated by the question of
his nephew, whether he would &quot;take such an insult from a d----d
nigger,&quot; Gorsuch fired at the colored man, and was followed by
his son and nephew, who both fired their revolvers. The fire was
returned by the blacks, who made a rush upon them at the same
time. Gorsuch and his son fell, the one dead the other wounded.
The rest of the party after firing their revolvers, fled
precipitately through the corn and to the woods, pursued by some
of the blacks. One was wounded, the rest escaped unhurt. Kline,
the deputy marshal, who now boasts of his miraculous escape from
a volley of musket-balls, had kept at a safe distance, though
urged by young Gorsuch to stand by his father and protect him,
when he refused to leave the ground. He of course came off
unscathed. Several colored men were wounded, but none severely.
Some had their hats or their clothes perforated with bullets;
others had flesh wounds. They said that the Lord protected them,
and they shook the
