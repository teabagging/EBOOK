Long engagements are irksome to both man and woman, and a man is generally not supposed to ask a girl to marry him until he is able to provide a home for her. This, however, does not prevent long friendships between young couples or a sentimental understanding growing up between them, and it is during this period that they learn to know each other and find out if they are suited for a life&#39;s partnership.</p><p>When a &quot;young man goes a-courting&quot; it generally means that he has some particular girl in mind whom he has singled out as the object of his devotion. A man a-courting is generally on his best behavior, and many a happily married wife looks back on her courting days as the most delightful of her life. At that time the woman is the object of a devotion to which she has as yet conceded nothing. She is still at liberty to weigh and choose, to compare her lover to other men, while the knowledge that she is the ultimate girl that some man is trying to win gives her a pretty sense of self-importance and a feeling that she has come into the heritage of womanhood.</p><p>Whether it is one of the fictions about courtship or not, it is generally assumed that a young woman is longer in making up her mind than is the young man. When a man finds the right girl he is pretty apt to know it, and it is his business then to start out and persuade her to his point of view. &quot;Neither willing nor reluctant&quot; is the attitude of the young girl.</p><p>Gifts and Attention.</p><p>Just what attention a man is privileged to show a young woman to whom he is not engaged, and yet to whom he wishes to express his devotion, is a point a little difficult to define.</p><p>If she is a bookish girl she will be pleased with gifts of books or the suggestion that they may read the same books so they may talk them over together. She will probably feel complimented if a man discusses with her his business affairs and the problems that are interesting men in their life work. When a man begins to call often and regularly on a girl it is best to have some topic of conversation aside from personalities.</p><p>When a man is led to spend more money than he can afford in entertaining a girl it is a bad preparation for matrimony. Courtship is a time when a man desires to bring gifts, and it is quite right and fitting that he should do so within reasonable limits. A girl of refined feelings does not like to accept valuable presents from a man at this period of their acquaintance. Flowers, books, music, if the girl plays or sings, and boxes of candy are always permissible offerings which neither engage the man who offers them nor the girl who receives them. This is the time when a man invites a girl to the theater, to concerts and lectures, and may offer to escort her to church. The pleasure of her society is supposed to be a full return for the trouble and expense incurred in showing these small attentions.</p><p>The Claims of Companionship.</p><p>A man cannot justly complain if a girl accepts similar favors from other men, for until he has proposed and been accepted he has no claim on her undivided companionship. An attitude of proprietorship on his part, particularly if it is exercised in public, is as bad manners as it is unwise, and a high-spirited girl, although she may find her feelings becoming engaged, is prone to resent it. It should be remembered that a man is free to cease his attentions, and until he has finally surrendered his liberty he should not expect her to devote all her time to him.</p><p>At this period it is a wise man who makes a friend of a girl&#39;s mother, and if he does this he will generally be repaid in a twofold manner. No matter how willful a girl may be, her mother&#39;s opinion of her friends always has weight with her.</p><p>Moreover, what the mother is the girl will in all probability become, and a man has no better opportunity of learning a girl&#39;s mental and moral qualities than by knowing the woman who bore and reared her.</p><p>Engagement and Wedding Rings.</p><p>The form and material of &quot;the mystic ring of marriage&quot; change but little, and innovations on the plain gold band are rarely successful. The very broad, flat band is now out of date and replaced by a much narrower ring, sufficiently thick, however, to stand the usage of a lifetime. It is generally engraved on the concealed side with the initials of the giver and the date of the marriage. The gold in the ring should be as pure as possible, and the color, which depends on the alloy used, should be unobtrusive, the pale gold being better liked now than the red gold. Many women never remove their wedding ring after it has been put on and believe it is bad luck to do so.</p><p>There is but one choice for an engagement ring, a solitaire diamond, and clusters or colored stones are not considered in this connection. As after the wedding the engagement ring is used as a guard to the wedding ring, it should be as handsome as possible, and a small, pure stone is a far better choice than a more showy one that may be a little off in color or possess a flaw.</p><p>Correct Form in Jewelry.</p><p>On the wedding day the groom often makes the bride a wedding present of some piece of jewelry, and if this is to be worn during the ceremony it should consist of white stones in a thin gold or platinum setting, such as a pendant, bracelet or pin of pearls and diamonds. If a colored stone is preferred--and a turquoise, for instance, adds the touch of blue which is supposed to bring a bride good luck--it should be concealed inside the dress during the services.</p><p>As a memento of the event a groom often presents his ushers with a scarf pin or watch or cigarette case ornamented with the initials of the bride and groom, and the bride generally makes a similar present to her bridesmaids of some dainty piece of jewelry. Whether this takes the form of a pin, bracelet or one of the novelties that up-to-date jewelers are always showing, it should be the best of its kind. Imitation stones or &quot;silver gilt&quot; have no place as wedding gifts.</p><p>Wedding Customs.</p><p>There is no time in a woman&#39;s life when ceremonies seem so important as when a wedding in the family is imminent. Whether the wedding is to be a simple home ceremony or an elaborate church affair followed by a reception, the formalities which etiquette prescribes for these functions should be carefully studied and followed. Only by doing so can there be the proper dignity, and above all the absence of confusion that should mark the most important episode in the life of a man or woman.</p><p>Wedding customs have undergone some changes of late years, mostly in the direction of simplicity. Meaningless display and ostentation should be avoided, and, if a girl is marrying into a family much better endowed in worldly goods than her own, she should have no false pride in insisting on simple festivities and in preventing her family from incurring expense that they cannot afford. The entire expenses of a wedding, with the exception of the clergyman&#39;s fee and the carriage which takes the bride and groom away for their honeymoon, are met by the bride&#39;s family, and there is no worse impropriety than in allowing the groom to meet or share any of these obligations. Rather than allow this a girl would show more self-respect in choosing to do away with the social side of the function and be content with the marriage ceremony read by her clergyman under his own roof.</p><p>Invitations and Announcements.</p><p>In the case of a private wedding announcement cards should be mailed the following day to all relatives and acquaintances of both the contracting parties.</p><p>Evening weddings are no longer the custom, and the fashionable hour is now high noon, although in many cases three o&#39;clock in the afternoon is the hour chosen. Whether the wedding is to be followed by a reception or not, the invitations to it should be sent out not less than two weeks before the event, and these should be promptly accepted or declined by those receiving them. The acceptance of a wedding invitation by no means implies that the recipient is obliged to give a present. These are only expected of relatives and near friends of the bride and groom, and in all cases the presents should be addressed and sent to the bride, who should acknowledge them by a prettily worded note of thanks as soon as the gifts are received or, at the latest, a few days after the marriage ceremony.</p><p>Silver and Linen.</p><p>The usual rule followed in the engraving of silver or the marking of linen is to use the initials of the bride&#39;s maiden name. The question of duplicate gifts is as annoying to the sender as it is to the young couple who are ultimately to enjoy the gifts. Theoretically, it is bad form to exchange a gift after it has been received, but, in truth, this is often done when a great deal of silver is given by close friends or members of the family it is a comparatively easy matter to find out what has already been sent and to learn the bride&#39;s wishes in this matter.</p><p>Prenuptial Functions.</p><p>After the wedding invitations are out it is not customary for a girl to attend any social functions or to be much seen in public. This gives her the necessary time to devote to the finishing of her trousseau and for making any necessary arrangements for the new life she is to take up after the honeymoon is over. Family dinners are quite proper at this time, and it is expected of her to give a lunch to her bridesmaids. The wedding presents may be shown at this occasion, but any more public and general display of them is now rarely indulged in and is, in fact, not considered in good taste.</p><p>The groom, as a prenuptial celebration, is supposed to give a supper to his intimate bachelor friends and the men who are to act as ushers at the marriage ceremony. The ushers are generally recruited from the friends of the groom rather than those of the bride, but if she has a grown brother he is always asked to act in this capacity. Ushers, like bridesmaids, are chosen among the unmarried friends of the young couple, although a matron of honor is often included in the bridal party.</p><p>The Bride&#39;s Trousseau.</p><p>The bride&#39;s trousseau should be finished well before the fortnight preceding the wedding. Fashions change so quickly now that it is rarely advisable for a bride to provide gowns for more than a season ahead. If the check her father furnishes her for her trousseau is a generous one it is a wise provision to put a part of it aside for later use, and in so doing she has the equivalent of a wardrobe that will last her for a year or more.</p><p>Custom has decreed that the bride&#39;s wedding dress shall be of pure white, and, as the marriage ceremony is a religious one, whether it takes place in a church or in a private house, that it shall be made high in the neck and with long sleeves. Orange blossoms, the natural flowers, form the trimming to the corsage and a coronet to fasten the veil. A bride&#39;s ornaments include only one gift of white jewelry, pearls or diamonds, from her future husband, and the bouquet he presents her.</p><p>So many awkward moments have been occasioned in wedding ceremonies by removing the glove that brides are dispensing with wearing gloves at this time. The bride&#39;s appearance is by no means affected by this custom, and the slipping of the ring on the third finger of the left hand is made simpler and thereby more graceful. The engagement ring, which up to the time of the wedding ceremony has been worn on this finger, afterwards serves as a guard for the wedding ring.</p><p>The Bridesmaids.</p><p>Millinery is a most important question in discussing a wedding, and we cannot dismiss the question with the gown worn by the bride. A most serious consideration is what the bridesmaids are to wear, and this is generally only settled after long and serious consultation with the bride.</p><p>It is generally agreed that all of these gowns shall be made by the same dressmaker so that they may conform to the colors and styles decided on, the gown of the maid or matron of honor differing slightly from the general scheme. At a church wedding bridesmaids wear hats and carry baskets or bouquets of flowers, but, if bouquets are carried, they should be quite unlike the one borne by the bride. It is customary for the bride to give her bridesmaids some souvenir of the occasion, and it is expected that the groom provide the gloves and ties for the ushers.</p><p>Duties of the &quot;Best Man.&quot;</p><p>The duties of the &quot;best man&quot; are arduous, and it is indeed wise, as it is general, for a man to ask his best and most devoted friend to serve in this capacity. The best man is supposed to relieve the groom of all the details of the ceremony and to take on his shoulders all the worry incident to its success as a social function. It is he who purchases the gloves and ties for the other ushers and sees that they are coached in their duties; he procures the marriage license, if that is necessary, and has the ring ready for the groom at the critical moment. After the ceremony he is supposed to hand the clergyman his fee, and at the same time be in readiness to conduct the line of bridesmaids and ushers to their carriages. He must be at the bride&#39;s home, in case there is a wedding reception, before the principal actors in the ceremony are there. It is he who sends the notices of the event to the newspapers, and, if there is a formal breakfast with speech-making, it is the best man who proposes the health of the newly-married pair and replies to the toast in behalf of the bridesmaids. He is the one member of the wedding party who sees the happy couple off at the station and bids them the last farewell as they depart on their honeymoon. This is perhaps the time and moment when his good sense and social tact is the most needed, The foolish custom of decorating bridal baggage with white ribbon, and of throwing a superabundance of old shoes and a rain of rice after the departing pair, may be mitigated by a little care on his part.</p><p>MOURNING CUSTOMS.</p><p>There has been of late years a healthy revolt against the excessive use of crepe or the wearing of mourning for an undue period. Mourning is first of all a protection, for in these busy days and in a large city a death affecting our acquaintances is not always known to us. If we meet a friend wearing black we are instantly apprised that she has suffered the loss of a near member of her family. It is easy to say under such circumstances, &quot;I am very sorry to see you in black,&quot; or &quot;I am afraid I have not heard of your loss.&quot;</p><p>For a father or mother full mourning, that is, black unrelieved by any touch of white, is worn for a year, and at the end of that period half mourning, consisting first of white with black, and then violet and gray, is worn for the second year. For a brother or sister or grandparent black is worn for six months, and then half mourning for the six months preceding the wearing of ordinary colors. What is called complimentary mourning, put on at the death of a relative by marriage, consists of the wearing of black for a period of from six weeks to a year, depending on the closeness of the personal relationship. For instance, in the case of the death of a mother-in-law residing in a distant city, it would only be necessary for a woman to wear black for a few weeks following the funeral. If, on the other hand, she resides in the same place and is a great deal in the company of her husband&#39;s family, it would show more tact and affection on her part to refrain from wearing colors for a longer period.</p><p>Crepe is no longer obligatory in even first mourning. Many widows only wear the crepe-bordered veil hanging from the conventional bonnet for the funeral services and for a few weeks afterward, when it is replaced by an ordinary hat and veil of plain black net bordered with thin black silk. Widows wear neck and cuff bands of unstarched white book muslin, this being the only sort of white permitted during the first period of mourning. Young widows, especially those who must lead an active life, often lighten their mourning during the second year and discard it at the end of the second year. Of course the conventional period of mourning for a widow is three years, but, if there should be any indication that a second marriage is contemplated, black should gradually be put aside.</p><p>However, the discarding of mourning is no indication that a woman is about to change her name, and the wearing of black is so much a matter of personal feeling that a woman should not be criticised for curtailing the conventional period.</p><p>In this country it is not the custom for young children to wear mourning, and with men the wearing of a black band about the hat or on the left arm is all that is deemed necessary.</p><p>A woman wearing full mourning refrains from attending the theater or any large functions. She may properly be seen at concerts, club meetings or lectures, and she may receive and visit her friends informally.</p><p>ETIQUETTE OF THE VISITING CARD.</p><p>The prevailing shape for a woman&#39;s card is nearly square (about 2-1/2 by 3 inches), while the correct form for a man&#39;s card is slightly smaller. The color should be pure white with a dull finish, while the engraving, plain script or more elaborate text, is a matter of choice and fashion varying from time to time. It is safe to trust the opinion of a first-class stationer in this matter, for styles fluctuate, and he should be constantly informed of what polite usage demands.</p><p>A woman&#39;s card should always bear the prefix &quot;Miss&quot; or &quot;Mrs.&quot; There is no exception to this rule save in the case of women who have regularly graduated in medicine or theology and who are allowed therefore the use of &quot;Dr.&quot; or &quot;Rev.&quot; before the name. &quot;Miss&quot; or &quot;Mrs.&quot; should not be used in addition to either of these titles.</p><p>The card of a married woman is engraved with her husband&#39;s full name, such as Mrs. William Eaton Brown, but she has no right to any titles he may bear. If he is a judge or colonel she is still Mrs. James Eaton Brown and not Mrs. Judge or Mrs. Colonel Brown.</p><p>A widow may with propriety retain the same visiting card that she used during the lifetime of her husband, especially if she has no grown son who bears his father&#39;s name. In that case she generally has her cards engraved with a part of her full maiden name before her husband&#39;s name, such as Mrs. Mary Baker Brown. In this country a divorced woman, if she has children, does not discard her husband&#39;s family name, neither does she retain his given name. For social purposes she becomes Mrs. Mary Baker Brown or, if she wishes, Mrs. Baker Brown.</p><p>The address is engraved in the lower right corner of the visiting-card, and, if a woman has any particular day for receiving her friends, that fact is announced in the lower left corner. As a rule even informal notes should not be written on a visiting-card, although when a card accompanies a gift it is quite proper to write &quot;Best wishes&quot; or &quot;Greetings&quot; on it. This is even done when a card does not accompany a gift, but it should be borne in mind that a card message should not take the place of a note of thanks or be used when a more formal letter is necessary.</p><p>A man&#39;s visiting-card should bear his full name with the prefix &quot;Mr.&quot; unless he has a military title above the grade of lieutenant or is a doctor or clergyman. In these cases the proper title should be used in place of &quot;Mr.&quot; Courtesy titles, although they may be common usage in conversation and a man may be known by them, are best abandoned on the visiting-card.</p><p>During the first year of marriage cards are engraved thus:</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. William Eaton Brown</p><p>and this card may be used in sending presents, returning wedding civilities or making calls, even when the bride is not accompanied by her husband. After the first year these cards are discarded, and husband and wife have separate visiting-cards.</p><p>In some communities it is not the custom for a young girl to make formal calls without her mother. To meet this requirement the girl&#39;s name with the prefix &quot;Miss&quot; is engraved on her mother&#39;s card, below her mother&#39;s name.</p><p>It is no longer considered necessary to leave a number of cards at the same house when calling in person or sending cards. If there are several women members of the family one card suffices. If a woman wishes to leave her husband&#39;s card she should leave two, one for the mistress and one for the man of the house. A woman never leaves a card for a man unless she has called on him on a matter of business and wishes him to be reminded of the fact.</p><p>At a tea or large afternoon reception a card should be left in the hall as a guest departs, so as to enable the hostess to preserve a record of those who have called on her. If she is not able to attend she should send her visiting-card so that it may arrive on the day of the function. After a dinner or any formal function she should make a personal call or leave her card in person.</p><p>When making an ordinary call it is not necessary to send one&#39;s visiting-card to the hostess by the servant who opens the door. Pronouncing the name distinctly is sufficient, but, if it is a first call, and there is danger that the hostess may not be familiar with the caller&#39;s address, it is best to leave a card on the hall table when leaving, no matter if the hostess herself conducts her visitor to the door.</p><p>When one is invited but unable to attend a church wedding it is necessary to send, on the day of the ceremony, cards to those who issue the invitations. An invitation to a wedding reception or breakfast demands a more formal acceptance sent immediately on receipt of the invitation and couched in the same manner in which the invitation reads.</p><p>A newcomer in town or a young married woman may receive a card from an older woman indicating her receiving days and hours. This is a polite invitation to call, and if she is unable to make a call at the time indicated she should send a card on that day.</p><p>Cards of condolence are left as soon as possible after learning of the affliction. It is not necessary to write anything on the card; in fact, it is better not to do so, for, if the acquaintance warrants a personal message, it should take the form of a letter. On the other hand it is quite proper in felicitating a friend on a happy event, such as the announcement of an engagement in the family or the arrival of a new baby, to send a visiting-card with &quot;Congratulations&quot; written on it.</p><p>There are times when it seems necessary to send cards to practically all one&#39;s acquaintances, This is wise after a long absence or a change of residence, and when one is leaving town for a long period it is proper to send cards with the French expression, &quot;Pour prendre conge.&quot;</p><p>FORMALITIES IN DRESS AND ETIQUETTE.</p><p>&quot;Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy&quot; was old Polonius&#39; advice to his son, and he counseled suitability as well. It is this question of suitability that is the hall mark of correct dressing. A safe rule to follow, especially in the case of a young woman, is not to be conspicuous in attire and to conform to the standards of dress as set down by older women of recognized standing in the town in which she lives and the community in which her social or business life is spent.</p><p>A young girl needs little adorning. Her school or college dresses should be characterized by their neatness, freshness, correctness of cut and utility rather than by elaborate trimmings or costly materials. Her party gowns are simpler than those of a girl who has left school, and she wears less jewelry. At the end of school life, if her parents are able and willing to give her a coming-out party, she begins her social career under the pleasantest auspices, and this is the opportunity for her first elaborate gown.</p><p>The Debutante.</p><p>The character of this gown depends largely on the nature of the entertainment given her.</p><p>It most commonly takes the form of an afternoon tea or reception to which her mother invites all of her friends as well as the younger set. The debutante receives with her mother and wears an elaborate frock of light material and color, made high in the neck and with elbow sleeves. Long white gloves are worn, and her hair is more elaborately arranged than it was during her school-girl period. In fact, she is now a full- fledged young lady and is dressed accordingly. Such a gown may serve later as an informal evening gown, or, if it is made with a detachable yoke, it may be worn as a dancing-frock or for any evening occasion for which a full evening gown is expected.</p><p>The receiving party at an afternoon function generally includes near relatives of the debutante, and a number of her intimate girl friends are asked to assist in various ways. These receive with her and her mother in the early part of the afternoon and later assist at the tea table or mingle among the guests. The ladies assisting do not wear hats, and the young girls in the party are gowned much like the debutante, except that their gowns may be less elaborate if they choose, and they do not carry flowers.</p><p>A popular girl or one with many family connections may count on a good many floral offerings on the occasion of her coming-out party. These are scattered about the room, either left in bunches or arranged in vases. One large bunch she generally carries in her left hand, and it is a wise girl who avoids singling out anyone of her men friends by carrying his flowers. A gift from her father or brother or the flowers sent by some friend of the family is the better choice. The success a girl makes during her first year in society depends more on her general popularity than on the devotion of any one man.</p><p>Afternoon Reception.</p><p>For an afternoon reception light refreshments, consisting of tea, coffee, chocolate, perhaps a light claret cup, with cakes and delicate sandwiches, are sufficient, and these are set out on a long table in a room adjoining the reception parlors.</p><p>If a large number of guests are expected it is necessary to have a maid or two in attendance to remove cups and saucers, keep the tea urn replenished with hot water and to bring additional cakes and sandwiches if the supply on the table is in danger of running short. Two women friends are generally asked to preside at the refreshment table, one at each end to pour tea and chocolate, and, as this task is an arduous one and much of the success of the entertainment depends on its being well done, it is advisable to relieve the ladies in charge during the afternoon. This, however, like every other feature of the entertainment, should be arranged beforehand. The charm of an afternoon reception lies in its apparent informality, but every detail should be considered in advance and all contingencies provided for. The debutante, and especially her mother, should be relieved from all such responsibilities before the guests begin to come.</p><p>The mother&#39;s duties consist in welcoming her guests and presenting her daughter to them. If many people are arriving the guests are quickly passed on to some one of the ladies assisting, whose duty it is to see that they meet some of those who are already in the room and are eventually asked to the tea table. A part of the receiving party, and certainly the hostess and her daughter, should remain together in a place where they may be easily found as the guests enter the room.</p><p>No more sympathetic act of friendship can be shown a debutante than to contribute toward the success of her party. Girls who are asked to assist should remember that their first duty is not to entertain their own friends who may happen to be present, but to see that everyone is welcome and that especially those who are not acquainted with many in the room have an opportunity to become so. Anyone asked to assist at a function of this sort is in a sense a hostess, and it is quite within her province to enter into conversation with any unoccupied guest whether she has been introduced or not.</p><p>The usual hours for an afternoon tea are from four to six, but in the case of a coming-out reception the hour is often prolonged to seven so as to allow more men to be present than would be the case if the time were restricted to the early afternoon. In these busy days few men are at liberty to make afternoon calls, and it is always a compliment to a girl if her tea includes a sprinkling of black coats. Whatever hours are decided on, they should be engraved on the cards sent out two weeks before the tea. These are of the form and size of an ordinary visiting-card and include the daughter&#39;s name below that of her mother&#39;s. If she is the eldest unmarried daughter or the only girl in the family the card reads as follows:</p><pre><code>                         Mrs. Geo. Baker Blank
                         Miss Blank
</code></pre><p>December 9, 1911 4 to 7 o&#39;clock</p><p>The daughter&#39;s given name is only used in case she has an older unmarried sister.</p><p>Ball and Evening Reception.</p><p>A more elaborate form of coming-out party consists of a ball or of an evening reception followed by dancing, and in this case the card contains the word &quot;Dancing&quot; below the date of the entertainment and the hours at which it is given. Few homes are large enough to provide for even a small dance, and so a party of this sort is generally given at a hotel. The guests as well as the receiving party wear evening gowns without hats, and men are expected to come in full evening clothes, which means the long-tailed coats and not the popular Tuxedo, white gloves, and, although this is not obligatory, white waistcoats.</p><p>After a girl has been introduced into society she has her individual visiting-cards, makes her own calls and is allowed to receive her own friends. Social customs differ with locality, and the chaperon is less customary in the West than in the East. In many cities girls are allowed to go to the theater and to evening parties with a man friend without a married woman being included in the party. A wise girl, however, is careful that any man she meets shall be introduced as soon as possible to some older member of her family and to introduce a young man calling for the first time to either her mother or father. Also when she accepts an invitation to an evening&#39;s entertainment she insists that her escort shall call for her at her own home and bring her directly home at the close of it. Dining or supping at a restaurant alone with a young man is sure to expose a girl to criticism.</p><p>A Woman&#39;s Lunch.</p><p>There are many pleasant forms of entertainment offered to a young girl entering society in which men are not included, and the most popular of these is a woman&#39;s lunch. This is a favorite form of entertainment for a young married woman to give in honor of some girl friend who has just come out in society or whose engagement has just been announced. One o&#39;clock or half after is the usual hour, and the meal is served in courses and is as elaborate as the household resources may allow. The decorations of the table are important, and three courses are sufficient if they are carefully arranged. Handsome street costumes are worn for a function of this sort, and the guest of honor, if there is one, dresses as the others do. Outer wraps are left in the hall or in a room put aside for this purpose, and, as a rule, hats are retained and gloves removed when the guests sit down at table.</p><p>The custom of wearing a hat during lunch is not an arbitrary one, and it is not universal. In France, for example, where social customs are most carefully observed, it is the custom to wear handsome afternoon gowns if invited for the noon meal and to remove hats. The noon meal there is a social function, and certain formalities are observed. In London, on the contrary, no matter if a number of guests are expected, lunch is an informal occasion, and women dress for lunch as they would for an afternoon tea.</p><p>Hats are worn and women are prepared to rush off afterwards to meet other engagements. The English custom prevails now in the large cities in America, and, moreover, women seem disinclined to remove their hats after they are once dressed for the round of the day&#39;s social obligations.</p><p>It is simpler and really quite conventional to leave the wearing of hats to the individual. The hostess should ask her guest if she wishes to take her hat off or retain it, and she can at the same time intimate to her guest, if she is a stranger in the town, what the others will probably do in this connection. True hospitality on the part of the hostess is to make her guests at ease, and true politeness on the part of the visitor is to conform to the rules governing the community that she is visiting.</p><p>PROPER APPAREL FOR MEN.</p><p>American gentlemen are no longer dependent on English tailors or on English fashions as they were some years ago. The American type of physique is a distinct one, and London tailors have never been able to fit American men as well as they do their own clients. Moreover social life is so different in the United States from what it is in England that men really need different clothes.</p><p>Practically all American men are business men for the working hours of the day, and few of them have any time or inclination for anything save business clothes while daylight lasts. For dinner or for the evening what are generally called evening clothes are permissible, and in fact obligatory in large cities for anything beyond the most informal home functions.</p><p>For the evening there is the informal and formal dress suit. The former consists of the long-tailed coat worn with either a white or black waistcoat. For a dancing party or formal dinner the white waistcoat is generally preferred, and, if it is worn, it must be accompanied by a white lawn tie. A made-up bow is considered incorrect. The accompaniments to a suit of this sort are patent-leather shoes and white kid gloves if dancing is a part of the evening programme.</p><p>The informal evening suit includes the shorter dinner jacket or Tuxedo, as it was formerly called, and, strictly speaking, this is only considered proper for the club or for parties where ladies are not expected to be present. However, men who commonly dress for dinner in the home circle generally prefer the dinner jacket to the long coat, and well-dressed men are often seen wearing it at small dinner parties, at the theater or at any informal evening event. This coat is always worn with a black tie and waistcoat, and it is not a suitable apparel for a dance or any large formal evening affair.</p><p>The correct dress for a daytime wedding is a black frock coat with light trousers, light fancy waistcoat and gray gloves and gray Ascot or four-in-hand tie, and the frock coat with black waistcoat proper for church or when making afternoon calls. Many young men are adopting for afternoon wear the English morning suit, which consists of a cutaway coat with trousers and waistcoat to match and made of some other color save black.</p><p>WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES.</p><p>First Anniversary Cotton Wedding Second Anniversary Paper Wedding Third Anniversary Leather Wedding Fifth Anniversary Wooden Wedding Seventh Anniversary Woolen Wedding Tenth Anniversary Tin Wedding Twelfth Anniversary Silk and Fine Linen Wedding Fifteenth Anniversary Crystal Wedding Twentieth Anniversary China Wedding Twenty-fifth Anniversary Silver Wedding Thirtieth Anniversary Pearl Wedding Fortieth Anniversary Ruby Wedding Fiftieth Anniversary Golden Wedding Seventy-fifth Anniversary Diamond Wedding</p><p>HOW TO SELECT COLORS</p><p>The Natural Laws of Tints, Tones, Shades and Hues.</p><p>Some combinations of color are pleasing to the eye, and some are discordant. The reasons for this are based on natural laws and are explained in a very simple manner in a learned article by Dr. W. K. Carr which originally appeared in Shop Notes Quarterly. Impressions continue upon the retina of the eye, says Dr. Carr, about one-sixth of a second after the object has been moved. For this reason a point of light or flame whirled swiftly around appears as a continuous ring. Or take a piece or red ribbon, place it on white paper, look intently at it for thirty seconds and suddenly remove the ribbon. The portion of the paper which was covered by the ribbon will then appear green. The explanation is that the color sensation in the eye is caused by the almost unthinkably rapid whirling of electrons around their atoms, and that the retina, becoming fatigued by the vibration of the red, is therefore less sensitive to them. When the ribbon is suddenly removed, the eye sees, not the blue, yellow and red which produce the white surface of the paper, but, because of the fatigue of the eye to the red, it sees only the blue and yellow constituents of the white light. But blue and yellow produce green; hence the tendency at the eye to see the complementary of a color. This may be referred to as the &quot;successive contrast of colors.&quot;</p><p>Colors for Blondes and for Brunettes.</p><p>Now, for a practical application of this knowledge.</p><p>The hair of the blond is a mixture of red, yellow and brown. As a rule the skin is lighter, that is, it contains not so much orange, and the tinges of red are lighter. Nature, therefore, very properly made the blond&#39;s eyes blue, since the blue is complementary to the orange of her hair.</p><p>The brunette&#39;s skin, on the other hand, has more orange in it, and hence a color favorable to one would not be becoming to the other.</p><p>What would be the effect of green upon a complexion deficient in red? It would certainly heighten the rose tints in the cheeks, but the greatest care should be exercised in the selection of the proper shade of green, because the brunette&#39;s complexion contains a great deal of orange, and the green, acting upon the red of the orange, could readily produce a brick-dust appearance. Green, therefore, is a risky color for a brunette, and so is violet, which would neutralize the yellow of the orange and heighten the red. But if the orange complexion had more yellow than red, then the association of violet would produce pallor. Yellow, of course, is her color, since its complementary violet neutralizes the yellow of the orange complexion and leaves the red.</p><p>But with the yellow-haired blond the conditions are very different. The complementary of blue is orange, which improves the hair and freshens the light flesh tints. A blond, therefore can wear blue, just as a brunette can wear yellow.</p><p>In arranging flowers the same law holds. Complementary colors should be placed side by side; blue with orange, yellow with violet, red and rose with green leaves. And anyone who successfully selects his wall paper and house furnishings is drawing unconsciously, perhaps, on an intuitive knowledge of these fundamental facts. Dark papers are bad, especially in rooms with a northern exposure, because they absorb too much light. The complementaries of red and violet are exceedingly trying to most complexions, and orange and orange-yellow are fatiguing to the eye. The most pleasing effects are to be had with yellow, light blue and light green, for the latter freshens the red in pale skins, and the blue heightens blond complexions, and goes well with gilding and with mahogany and cherry furniture.</p><p>COLOR CONTRAST AND HARMONY.</p><p>The following tables will be found useful in selecting colors for dress, decoration, or any other purpose in which the proper application of the true laws of contrast and harmony in color is desirable:</p><p>Contrasts in Color.</p><p>Yellow contrasts with-- Purple, russet, and auburn. Red contrasts with-- Green, olive, and drab. Blue contrasts with-- Orange, citrine, and buff.</p><p>Harmonies in Color.</p><p>Yellow harmonizes with-- Orange, green, citrine, russet, buff, and drab. Red harmonizes with-- Orange, purple, russet, citrine, auburn, and buff. Blue harmonizes with-- Purple, green, olive, citrine, drab, and auburn.</p><p>THE CARE OF THE TEETH.</p><p>Decay of the teeth, or caries, commences externally, appearing upon the enamel or bony structure of the teeth. Usually it is the result of chemical action produced by decomposition of food. Acids found in some fruits will cause decay if allowed to remain in contact with the teeth. Then there are the natural mouth acids, which, although not strong, are none the less effective if allowed to remain long enough around the teeth. Microscopical examinations have shown that the secretions of almost every person&#39;s month contain more or less vegetable and animal life that will withstand the application of acids and astringents and will only succumb to alkalies. A dentifrice or mouth wash should be alkaline.</p><p>Toothache.</p><p>Toothache is not always due to an exposed nerve, for in the majority of teeth extracted because they are painful the nerve is dead. Inflammation is often the cause of the trouble.</p><p>A toothache due to inflammation is a steady, aggravating pain, overspreading the affected side of the face, sometimes even the neck and shoulder. As there is no nerve to kill in a case of this kind, the tooth should be treated until cured, or removed upon the first symptom of trouble. Its extraction would be unattended by any danger and would afford welcome relief.</p><p>Tartar, a creamy, calcareous deposit, supposed to be from the saliva, will sometimes cause toothache. It accumulates around the necks of the teeth and eventually becomes hard and dark-colored. It also causes foul breath and loosens the gums from the teeth, causing them to present an unsightly appearance.</p><p>The Teeth of Children.</p><p>Children have twenty temporary teeth, which begin making their appearance about the sixth or seventh month. The time varies in different children. This is the most dangerous and troublesome period of the child&#39;s existence, and every parent will do well to consult a reputable dentist. About the second or third year the temporary teeth are fully developed. They require the same care to preserve them as is exercised toward the permanent set.</p><p>About the sixth year, or soon after, four permanent molars, or double teeth, make their appearance. Some parents mistakenly suppose these belong to the first set. It is a serious error. They are permanent teeth, and if lost will be lost forever. No teeth that come after the sixth year are ever shed. Let every parent remember this.</p><p>At twelve years the second set is usually complete, with the exception of the wisdom teeth, which appear anywhere from the eighteenth to the twenty-fourth year. When the second set is coming in the beauty and character of the child&#39;s countenance is completed or forever spoiled. Everything depends upon proper care at this time to see that the teeth come with regularity and are not crowded together. The teeth cannot have too much room. When a little separated they are less liable to decay.</p><p>Dentifrices--Useful and Injurious.</p><p>The habit of caring for the teeth daily, and if possible after each meal, should be established early in life.</p><p>Those who have neglected to do so should lose no time in consulting a reputable dentist, and then persistently caring for their teeth day by day. Children especially should be taught to use the tooth-brush and some reliable dentifrice. The more pleasant the preparation the easier it will be to teach them its daily use. A fragrant, refreshing liquid is recommended, as it is a mouth wash as well as a tooth cleanser. The habit thus formed, neglected for even a single day, will make the mouth feel decidedly uncomfortable.</p><p>Cleansing the Teeth.</p><p>Preparations for cleansing the teeth and purifying the mouth should be free from all acids, and should be saponaceous or soapy, containing as one of the principal ingredients an alkali to neutralize the acids and destroy the animal and vegetable parasites which, as the microscope would show us, are in the secretions of almost every person&#39;s mouth.</p><p>A finely triturated powder having slight abrasive properties, but free from dangerous grit, should be used as the complement of a liquid. One way to use both is to pour on the wet brush or into the palm of the hand a sufficient quantity of powder and moisten it with the liquid. Occasionally the powder or the liquid alone could be employed. Be careful to use a liquid and powder of established reputation.</p><p>Beware of thy teeth. Take good care of thy teeth, And they will take good care of thee.</p><p>THE PERFECT FEMALE FIGURE.</p><p>According to the Chicago Tribune, Miss Helen Loewe, a student at the Chicago Art Institute, is credited by art critics with closely approaching the standard of physical perfection set by statues of the goddess Venus. Miss Loewe was posed as a model for a series of photographs issued for the benefit of the playground fund of Oak Park.</p><p>Aside from the artistic nature of Miss Loewe, a comparison of measurements with those of the typically perfect figure explains part of the success of these photographic studies.</p><p>Miss Loewe. Perfect figure. 5 ft. 7 in Height. 5 ft. 8 in. 138 Weight 140 13-1/2 Neck 13 32 Chest 33 36 Bust 37 22 Waist 23 36 Hips 39 22 Thigh 24 10 Upper arm 11 8-1/2 Forearm 9 14 Calf 15</p><p>MEN AND COMPLEXIONS.</p><p>Dr. Katherine Blackford, of Boston, speaking of men&#39;s complexions, arrives at the following conclusions. There are, of course, exceptions to all rules: &quot;As a general rule, the blonds are inconstant. They change their minds too often. They get angry one moment and forgive the next. They are impulsive, and when they do commit crimes they are done on the impulse of the moment. A blond radiates his personality about him. The brunette, on the other hand as a rule, likes to concentrate on one subject. He is a specialist. He prefers his home and family, and his pleasures are more often lectures and kindred entertainments than those of a lighter order. He learns slowly, but he retains what he knows far better than does the blond.&quot;</p><p>HOW THE BABY&#39;S MIND DEVELOPS.</p><p>In his book on &quot;The Development of the Intellect,&quot; Mr. H. W. Brown presents a conspectus of the observations of Prof. Preyer on the mind of the child which shows chronologically the gradual development of the senses, intellect and will of the growing child and presents in a condensed form the result of a great number of careful observations.</p><p>It is recorded that sensibility to light, touch, temperature, smell and taste are present on the first day of infant life. Hearing, therefore, is the only special sense which is not active at this time. The child hears by the third or fourth day. Taste and smell are senses at the first most active, but they are differentiated. General organic sensations of well being or discomfiture are felt from the first, but pain and pleasure as mental states are not noted till at or near the second month.</p><p>The first sign of speech in the shape of utterance of consonant sounds is heard about the end of the second month, these consonants being generally &quot;m,&quot; &quot;r,&quot; &quot;g,&quot; or &quot;t.&quot; All the movements of the eyes become co-ordinate by the fourth month, and by this time the child begins to have the &quot;feeling of self,&quot; that is, he looks at his own hands and looks at himself in the mirror. The study of the child&#39;s mind during the first year shows conclusively that ideas develop and reasoning processes occur before there is any knowledge of words or of language; though it may be assumed that the child thinks in symbols, visual or auditory, which are clumsy equivalents for words. By the end of the year the child begins to express itself by sounds--that is, speech begins. The development of this speech capacity is, according to Preyer, in accordance with the development of the intellectual powers. By the end of the second year the child&#39;s power of speech is practically acquired.</p><p>THE WONDERFUL HUMAN BRAIN.</p><p>According to the novel computations of a renowned histologist, who has been calculating the aggregate cell forces of the human brain, the cerebral mass is composed of at least 300,000,000 of nerve cells, each an independent body, organism, and microscopic brain so far as concerns its vital functions, but subordinate to a higher purpose in relation to the functions of the organ; each living a separate life individually, though socially subject to a higher law of function.</p><p>The lifetime of a nerve cell he estimates to be about sixty days, so that 5,000,000 die every day, about 200,000 every hour, and nearly 3,500 every minute, to be succeeded by an equal number of their progeny; while once in every sixty days a man has a new brain.</p><p>MOURNING COLORS THE WORLD OVER.</p><p>Black is by no means the only color used by man to express grief or mourning for the dead. In the South Sea Islands the natives express sorrow and hope by stripes of black and white. Grayish brown, the color of the earth to which the dead return, is used in Ethiopia. Pale brown, the color of withered leaves, is the mourning of Persia. Sky-blue, to express the assured hope that the deceased has gone to heaven, is the mourning of Syria, Cappadocia, and Armenia. Deep blue in Bokhara. Purple and violet, to express &quot;kings and queens to God,&quot; was the color of mourning for cardinals and kings of France. The color of mourning in Turkey is violet. White (emblem of hope) is the color of mourning in China. Henry VIII. wore white for Anne Boleyn. The ladies of ancient Rome and Sparta wore white. It was the color of mourning in Spain till 1498. Yellow is the color of mourning in Egypt and in Burmah. Anne Boleyn wore yellow mourning for Catharine of Aragon.</p><p>CURIOUS FACTS ABOUT HAIR.</p><p>The hair of men is finer than that of women.</p><p>The average weight of a head of hair is from 5 to 12 ounces.</p><p>On an average head there are about 1,000 hairs to the square inch.</p><p>Hair will stretch about one-fourth of its length and retract nearly to its original length.</p><p>Four hairs of good strength will hold suspended a one-pound weight. A single head of hair, of average growth, would therefore hold suspended an entire audience of 200 people.</p><p>THINGS THAT ARE MISNAMED</p><p>Catgut is gut of sheep.</p><p>Baffin&#39;s Bay is no bay at all.</p><p>Arabic figures were invented by the Indians.</p><p>Turkish baths are not of Turkish origin.</p><p>Blacklead is a compound of carbon and iron.</p><p>Slave by derivation should mean noble, illustrious.</p><p>Turkeys do not come from Turkey, but North America.</p><p>Titmouse is not a mouse, but a little hedge sparrow.</p><p>Dutch clocks are of German (Deutsch), not Dutch manufacture.</p><p>Salt (that is table salt) is not a salt at all, but &quot;chloride of sodium.&quot;</p><p>Galvanized iron is not galvanized--simply iron coated with zinc.</p><p>Ventriloquism is not voice from the stomach, but from the mouth.</p><p>Kid gloves are not kid at all, but are made of lambskin or sheepskin.</p><p>Pompey&#39;s Pillar, in Alexandria, was erected neither by nor to Pompey.</p><p>Tonquin beans come from Tonka, in Guinea, not Tonquin, in Asia.</p><p>Fire, air, earth, and water, called the four elements, are not elements at all.</p><p>Rice paper is not made from rice, but from the pith of Tungtsau, or hollowplant.</p><p>Japan lacquer contains no lac at all, but is made from the resin of a kind of nut tree.</p><p>Pen means a feather.

Always be kind to me. Pet me sometimes, that I may serve you the more gladly and learn to love you. Do not jerk the reins, and do not whip me when going up hill. Never strike, beat or kick me when I do not understand what you want, but give me a chance to understand you. Watch me, and if I fail to do your bidding, see if something is not wrong with my harness or feet.</p><p>Do not overload me or hitch me where water will drip on me. Keep me well shod. Examine my teeth when I do not eat; I may have an ulcerated tooth, and that, you know, is painful. Do not tie or check my head in an unnatural position or take away my best defence against flies and mosquitoes by cutting off my mane or tail.</p><p>I cannot tell you when I am thirsty, so give me clean, cool water often. I cannot tell you in words when I am sick, so watch me and by signs you may know my condition. Give me all possible shelter from the hot sun, and put a blanket on me not when I am working, but when I am standing in the cold. Never put a frosty bit in my mouth; first warm it by holding it in your hands.</p><p>I try to carry you and your burdens without a murmur, and wait patiently for you long hours of the day or night. Without the power to choose my shoes or path, I sometimes fall on the hard pavements, and I must be ready at any moment to lose my life in your service.</p><p>And finally, O, my master, when my useful strength is gone, do not turn me out to starve or freeze, nor sell me to some human brute to be slowly tortured and starved to death, but do thou, my master, take my life in the kindest way, and your God will reward you here and hereafter. Amen.</p><p>A LADY&#39;S CHANCE OF MARRYING.</p><p>Every woman has some chance to marry. It may be one to fifty, or it may be ten to one that she will.

Rub well into the face with the brush, then with the fingers. The longer you lather and the more you rub, the easier the shave.</p><p>The hair usually grows downward. Shave with the grain, not against it. Use a sliding motion, as well as downward.</p><p>If you get a &quot;nick,&quot; wash with cold water. Rubbing the cut with a piece of lump alum will stop the bleeding at once and help to heal.</p><p>Hold the razor properly. Lay it as flat as possible--the back of razor nearly touching the skin. Have it under easy control. Don&#39;t grab it--an easy position means an easy shave.</p><p>A poor strop will spoil the best razor ever made.</p><p>To buy a good razor and a cheap strop is pour economy.</p><p>If you prefer a swing strop, pull it as tightly as you can. Better use a stiff strop--cushion or solid--if in doubt.</p><p>A serious mistake made by a number of self-shavers is to hold the strop loose. This bends the invisible teeth and rounds the edge.</p><p>Strop your razor before and after shaving. This keeps the edge free from rust.</p><p>Dip your razor in hot water before stropping and shaving. This dissolves the accumulation in the invisible teeth.</p><p>Press as hard as you like on the back of the blade, but very lightly on the edge.</p><p>As you reach the end of the strop, turn the razor on the back of the blade to strop the other side, pulling toward you.</p><p>Keep rust away from your strop, and remember that a cut in the strop will ruin your razor. Don&#39;t use a strop that is cut.</p><p>FACTS TO SETTLE ARGUMENTS</p><p>Telephone invented. 1861.</p><p>There are 2,750 languages.</p><p>Sound moves 743 miles per hour.</p><p>Hawks can fly 150 miles an hour.</p><p>Chinese invented paper, 170 B.

Ten years later, in 1785, there were seven published in the English language in Philadelphia alone, of which one was a daily. The oldest newspaper published in Philadelphia at the time of the Federal convention was the Pennsylvania Gazette, established by Samuel Keimer, in 1728. The second newspaper in point of age was the Pennsylvania Journal, established in 1742 by William Bradford, whose uncle, Andrew Bradford, established the first newspaper in Pennsylvania, the American Weekly Mercury, in 1719. Next in age, but the first in importance, was the Pennsylvania Packet, established by John Dunlap, in 1771. In 1784 it became a daily, being the first daily newspaper printed on this continent.</p><p>&quot;Liberty,&quot; Bartholdi&#39;s statue, presented to the United States by the French people in 1885, is the largest statue ever built. Its conception is due to the great French sculptor whose name it bears. It is said to be a likeness of his mother. Eight years of time were consumed in the construction of this gigantic brazen image. Its weight is 440,000 pounds, of which 146,000 pounds are copper, the remainder iron and steel. The major part of the iron and steel was used in constructing the skeleton frame work for the inside. The mammoth electric light held in the hands of the giantess is 305 feet above tide-water. The height of the figure is 152-1/2 feet; the pedestal 91 feet, and the foundation 52 feet and 10 inches. Forty persons can find standing-room within the mighty head, which is 14-1/2 feet in diameter. A six-foot man standing on the lower lip could hardly reach the eyes. The index finger is 8 feet in length and the nose 3-3/4 feet. The Colossus of Rhodes was a pigmy compared with this latter-day wonder.</p><p>The largest and grandest temple of worship in the world is St. Peter&#39;s Cathedral at Rome. It stands on the site of Nero&#39;s circus, in the northwest part of the city, and is built in form of a Latin cross. The total length of the interior is 612-1/2 English feet; transept, 446-1/2 feet; height of nave, 152-1/2 feet; diameter of cupola, 193 feet; height of dome from pavement to top of cross, 448 feet. The great bell alone, without the hammer or clapper, weighs 18,600 pounds, or over 9-1/4 tons. The foundation was laid in 1450 A. D. Forty-three Popes lived and died during the time the work was in progress. It was dedicated in the year 1826, but not entirely finished until the year 1880. The cost, in round numbers, is set down at $70,000,000.</p><p>The great pyramid of Cheops is the largest structure of any kind ever erected by the hand of man. Its original dimensions at the base were 764 feet square, and its perpendicular height in the highest point 488 feet; it covers four acres, one rood and twenty-two perches of ground and has been estimated by an eminent English architect to have cost not less than 30,000,000 pounds, which in United States currency would be about $145,200,000. Internal evidence proves that the great pyramid was begun about the year 2170 B. c., about the time of the birth of Abraham. It is estimated that about 5,000,000 tons of hewn stone were used in its construction, and the evidence points to the fact that these stones were brought a distance of about 700 miles from quarries in Arabia.</p><p>The largest body of fresh water in the world is Lake Superior. It is 400 miles long and 180 miles wide; its circumference, including the winding of its various bays, has been estimated at 1,800 miles. Its area in square miles is 32,000, which is greater than the whole of New England, leaving out Maine. The greatest depth of this inland sea is 200 fathoms, or 1,200 feet. Its average depth is about 160 fathoms. It is 636 feet above the sea level.</p><p>The corner stone of the Washington monument, the highest in the United States, and until 1889 the highest structure in the world, was laid July 4, 1848. Robert E. Winthrop, then Speaker of the House, delivered the oration. Work progressed steadily for about six years, until the funds of the monumental society became exhausted. At that time the monument was about 175 feet high. From 1854 until 1879 nothing to speak of was done on the building. In the year last above named Congress voted an appropriation of $200,000 to complete the work. From that time forward work progressed at a rapid rate until December 6th, 1884, when the aluminum apex was set at 555 feet 5-1/2 inches from the foundation and the work declared finished. The foundation is 146-1/2 feet square; number of stones used above the 130-foot level, 19,163; total weight stone used in work, 81,120 tons.</p><p>The largest State in our grand republic is Texas, which contains 274,350 square miles, capable of sustaining 20,000,000 people, and then it would not be more crowded than Scotland is at present. It has been estimated that the entire population of the globe could be seated upon chairs within the boundary of Texas and each have four feet of elbow room.</p><p>The Mississippi River, from the source of the Missouri to the Eads jetties, is the longest river in the world. It is 4,300 miles in length and drains an area of 1,726,000 square miles. The Amazon, which is without doubt the widest river in the world, including the Beni, is 4,000 miles in length and drains 2,330,000 square miles of territory.</p><p>THE SINGLE TAX.</p><p>This idea was first formulated by Mr. Henry George in 1879, and has grown steadily in favor. Single-tax men assert as a fundamental principle that all men are equally entitled to the use of the earth; therefore, no one should be allowed to hold valuable land without paying to the community the value of the privilege. They hold that this is the only rightful source of public revenue, and they would therefore abolish all taxation--local, state and national--except a tax upon the rental value of land exclusive of its improvements, the revenue thus raised to be divided among local, state and general governments, as the revenue from certain direct taxes is now divided between local and state governments.</p><p>The single tax would not fall on all land, but only on valuable land, and on that in proportion to its value. It would thus be a tax, not on use or improvements, but on ownership of land, taking what would otherwise go to the landlord as owner.</p><p>In accordance with the principle that all men are equally entitled to the use of the earth, they would solve the transportation problem by public ownership and control of all highways, including the roadbeds of railroads, leaving their use equally free to all.</p><p>The single-tax system would, they claim, dispense with a horde of tax-gatherers, simplify government, and greatly reduce its cost; give us with all the world that absolute free trade which now exists between the States of the Union: abolish all taxes on private issues of money; take the weight of taxation from agricultural districts, where land has little or no value apart from improvements, and put it upon valuable land, such as city lots and mineral deposits. It would call upon men to contribute for public expenses in proportion to the natural opportunities they monopolize, and make it unprofitable for speculators to hold land unused or only partly used, thus opening to labor unlimited fields of employment, solving the labor problem and abolishing involuntary poverty.</p><p>THE MYSTERIES OF HYPNOTISM.</p><p>A Compend of the General Claims Made by Professional Hypnotists.</p><p>Animal magnetism is the nerve-force of all human and animal bodies, and is common to every person in a greater or less degree. It may be transmitted from one person to another. The transmitting force is the concentrated effort of will-power, which sends the magnetic current through the nerves of the operator to the different parts of the body of his subject. It may be transmitted by and through the eyes, as well as the finger tips, and the application of the whole open hands, to different regions of the body of the subject, as well as to the mind. The effect of this force upon the subject will depend very much upon the health, mental capacity and general character of the operator. Its action in general should be soothing and quieting upon the nervous system; stimulating to the circulation of the blood, the brain and other vital organs of the body of the subject. It is the use and application of this power or force that constitutes hypnotism.</p><p>Magnetism is a quality that inheres in every human being, and it may be cultivated like any other physical or mental force of which men and women are constituted. From the intelligent operator using it to overcome disease, a patient experiences a soothing influence that causes a relaxation of the muscles, followed by a pleasant, drowsy feeling which soon terminates in refreshing sleep. On waking, the patient feels rested; all his troubles have vanished from consciousness and he is as if he had a new lease of life.</p><p>In the true hypnotic condition, when a patient voluntarily submits to the operator, any attempt to make suggestions against the interests of the patient can invariably be frustrated by the patient. Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and some of the best known operators who have recorded their experiments assert that suggestions not in accord with the best interest of the patient could not be carried out. No one was ever induced to commit any crime under hypnosis, that could not have been induced to do the same thing much easier without hypnosis.</p><p>The hypnotic state is a condition of mind that extends from a comparatively wakeful state, with slight drowsiness, to complete somnambulism, no two subjects, as a rule, ever presenting the same characteristics.</p><p>The operator, to be successful, must have control of his own mind, be in perfect health and have the ability to keep his mind concentrated upon the object he desires to accomplish with his subject.</p><p>HOW TO CARE FOR A PIANO. By William H. Damon</p><p>The most important thing in the preservation of a piano is to avoid atmospheric changes and extremes and sudden changes of temperature. Where the summer condition of the atmosphere is damp all precautions possible should be taken to avoid an entirely dry condition in winter, such as that given by steam or furnace heat. In all cases should the air in the home contain moisture enough to permit a heavy frost on the windows in zero weather. The absence of frost under such conditions is positive proof of an entirely dry atmosphere, and this is a piano&#39;s most dangerous enemy, causing the sounding board to crack, shrinking up the bridges, and consequently putting the piano seriously out of tune, also causing an undue dryness in all the action parts and often a loosening of the glue joints, thus producing clicks and rattles. To obviate this difficulty is by no means an easy task and will require considerable attention. Permit all the fresh air possible during winter, being careful to keep the piano out of cold drafts, as this will cause a sudden contraction of the varnish and cause it to check or crack. Plants in the room are desirable and vessels of water of any kind will be of assistance. The most potent means of avoiding extreme dryness is to place a single-loaf bread-pan half full of water in the lower part of the piano, taking out the lower panel and placing it on either side of the pedals inside. This should be refilled about once a month during artificial heat, care being taken to remove the vessel as soon as the heat is discontinued in the spring. In cases where stove heat is used these precautions are not necessary.</p><p>The action of a piano, like any other delicate piece of machinery, should be carefully examined, and, if necessary, adjusted each time it is tuned. The hammers need occasional and careful attention to preserve original tone quality and elasticity. Never allow the piano to be beaten or played hard upon. This is ruinous to both the action and tuning. When not in use the music rack and top should be closed to exclude dust. The keyboard need never be closed, as the ivory needs both light and ventilation and will eventually turn yellow unless left open.</p><p>The case demands careful treatment to preserve its beauty and polish, Never use anything other than a soft piece of cotton cloth or cheese cloth to dust it with. Never wipe it with a dry chamois skin or silk cloth. Silk is not as soft as cotton and will scratch. A dry chamois skin picks up the dust and grit and gradually scours off the fine finish. In dusting never use a feather duster, nor rub the piano hard with anything. The dust should be whipped off, and not rubbed into the varnish. If the piano is dingy, smoky or dirty looking, it should be washed carefully with lukewarm water with a little ammonia in it to soften it. Never use soap. Use nothing but a small, soft sponge and a chamois skin. Wipe over a small part at a time with the sponge, following quickly with the wet chamois skin wrung out of the same water. This will dry it immediately and leave it as beautiful and clean as new. Never use patent polishes. If your piano needs polishing employ a competent polisher to give it a hand-rubbing friction polish.</p><p>The highest mountain on the globe is not, as is generally supposed, Mt. Everest, that honor belonging to a lofty peak named Mt. Hercules on the Isle of Papua, New Guinea, discovered by Capt. Lawson in 1881, According to Lawson, this monster is 32,763 feet in height, being 3,781 feet higher than Mt. Everest, which is only 29,002 feet above the level of the Indian Ocean.</p><p>[Transcriber&#39;s Note: The highest point in New Guinea is Puncak Jaya (Mount Carstensz or the Carstensz Pyramid), at 16,023 feet.]</p><p>SALT-RISING BREAD.</p><p>The real formula for making salt-rising bread, as set down by the daughter of Governor Stubbs, of Kansas, and by him communicated to Theodore Roosevelt, is as follows, according to the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;:</p><p>&quot;On the night before you contemplate this masterpiece of baking take half a cupful of corn meal and a pinch each of salt and sugar. Scald this with new milk heated to the boiling point and mix to the thickness of mush. This can be made in a cup. Wrap in a clean cloth and put in a warm place overnight.</p><p>&quot;In the morning, when all is ready, take a one-gallon stone jar and into this put one scant cupful of new milk. Add a level teaspoonful of salt and one of sugar. Scald this with three cupfuls of water heated to the boiling point. Reduce to a temperature of one hundred and eight degrees with cold water, using a milk thermometer to enable you to get exactly the right temperature. Then add flour and mix to a good batter; after the batter is made, mix in your starter that was made the night before. Cover the stone jar with a plate and put the jar in a large kettle of water and keep this water at a temperature of one hundred and eight degrees until the sponge rises. It should rise at least an inch and a half. When it has raised mix to a stiff dough, make into loaves and put into pans. Do not let the heat get out of the dough while working. Grease the loaves well on top and set your bread where it will be warm and rise. After the loaves rise bake in a medium oven for one hour and ten minutes. When you take the loaves from the oven wrap them in a bread-cloth.&quot;</p><p>A CURE FOR LOVE.</p><p>Take twelve ounces of dislike, one pound of resolution, two grains of common sense, two ounces of experience, a large sprig of time, and three quarts of cooling water of consideration. Set them over a gentle fire of love, sweeten it with sugar of forgetfulness, skim it with the spoon of melancholy, put it in the bottom of your heart, cork it with the cork of clean conscience. Let it remain and you will quickly find ease and be restored to your senses again.</p><p>These things can be had of the apothecary at the house of Understanding next door to Reason, on Prudent street.</p><p>DOING BUSINESS WITH A BANK</p><p>In opening your account with a bank it is proper that you should first be introduced to the cashier, or some other official. If you are engaged in business, that officer will inquire as to your particular business or calling, your address, etc., and unless he is already satisfied on this point, he may make inquiries as to your business standing. This being satisfactory, he will hand you a passbook, and some deposit tickets, whereupon you make your first deposit, entering the amount on the ticket. You will then be asked to write your signature in a book provided for that purpose, or upon a card to be filed away for reference.</p><p>The Signature.</p><p>This signature should be just as you intend to use it in all your dealings with the bank. If, for instance, your name is John Henry Smith, you may write it J. H. Smith, J. Henry Smith. John H. Smith or John Henry Smith, but whatever form you adopt should be used all the time. Once having adopted the form, it should be maintained in exactly that way. The only excuse for variation from your usual signature is when presenting checks or other paper made payable to you. In that case, supposing you had adopted the form J. Henry Smith for your regular signature, and the check is made payable to John H. Smith, you should first write on the back of that check &quot;John H. Smith,&quot; and immediately under this you should place your regular signature.</p><p>Depositing Money.</p><p>When making a deposit, always use the deposit ticket provided by the bank, filling it out yourself in ink. From this ticket, which is first checked up by the receiving teller, the amount of your deposit is placed to your credit. Do not ask the teller to fill our your deposit ticket. No doubt he would be glad to accommodate you, but to do so would violate a rule which protects both the bank and the depositor, Deposit tickets are preserved by the bank, and often serve to correct mistakes.</p><p>How to Avoid Mistakes.</p><p>Consider for a moment the vast aggregate of bank transactions, and you will see that perfect system on the part of the banks and bank officials is required to insure accuracy and avoid mistakes. Sometimes the requirements of the banks may seem arbitrary and troublesome, but reflection will show that they safeguard the depositor as well as the bank. The simple rules here laid down will enable anyone who has business with a bank to do so with the least trouble and with absolute safety.</p><p>How to Make Out a Check.</p><p>Checks are the most satisfactory and most convenient method of paying a debt or making any ordinary remittance. The stub of your check book will furnish a permanent memorandum, and when the check is canceled and returned to you by the bank, it is an indisputable evidence that the debt has been paid, or that the remittance has been made. The making of a check is a simple matter, but even the best business men make mistakes sometimes which are as difficult to remedy as they are easy to avoid. The hints here given and the facsimiles of checks printed in illustration will repay careful study.</p><p>[Illustration: A Check Properly Drawn. The name and amount are against the left side of their fields.]</p><p>The first facsimile shows a check properly made. It will be seen, in the first place, that this check is written very plainly, and that there is no room for the insertion of extra figures or words. The writing of the amount commences as nearly as possible to the extreme left of the check. The figures are written close together and there is no space between the first figure and the dollar mark.</p><p>All erasures in checks should be avoided. If you have made a mistake, tear a blank check from the back of your check book and use that in place of the one spoiled.</p><p>Some business men allow their clerks to fill out checks on the typewriter. This is ill-advised for two reasons: First, it is much easier to alter a typewritten check than one filled in with a pen; in the second place, a teller, in passing on the genuineness of a check, takes into consideration the character of the handwriting in the body of the check as well as in the signature. The typewritten characters offer no clue to individuality.</p><p>Never mail a check drawn to &quot;Bearer.&quot; Remember that if your check is made payable to &quot;Bearer&quot; or to &quot;John Smith or Bearer&quot; it may be cashed by anybody who happens to have it. Unless it is for a large amount the paying teller of your bank will look only to see whether your signature is correct, and, that being right, the bank cannot be held responsible if the check should have come into the wrong hands.</p><p>A check drawn to order can be cashed only when the person to whose order it has been drawn has indorsed it by writing his or her name on the back and the bank will be responsible for the correctness of the indorsement.</p><p>If you make your check payable say, to William Armstrong or order, nobody but William Armstrong, or some one to whom he indorses the check, can collect the amount, and if through fraud or otherwise some one not entitled to it gets the money which the check calls for, the responsibility is not yours, but the bank&#39;s. It is for that reason that bankers and business men use such great care in accepting checks.</p><p>[Illustration: A Check Carelessly Drawn. The text and numbers for the amount is in the center of their fields, leaving of space for extra text.]</p><p>[Illustration: The Same Check &quot;Raised&quot;. The amount has been changed from One Hundred/100.00 to Eighty-One Hundred/$8100.00.]</p><p>For the same reason you should never accept a check from anybody whom you do not know as responsible, and you should not be surprised or angered if some one else should hesitate to take a check from you.</p><p>Checks or drafts received by you should be deposited as soon as possible. Should you receive a check for a considerable amount and have no convenient bank account, you should go to the bank on which the check is drawn and have the cashier certify it by stamping &quot;Accepted&quot; or &quot;Certified&quot; across the face over his signature. That formality makes the paper as good as money so long as the bank accepting it is solvent.</p><p>It sometimes happens that a check drawn in good faith by a responsible party is withheld so long by the person receiving it that there is no money to the account when the check is finally presented.</p><p>Paying Notes and Acceptances.</p><p>Make your notes and accepted drafts payable at the bank where you do business. Whether it or other banks hold them for collection, they will be presented to your bank when due.</p><p>Pay your notes, etc., on the day they fall due, and early in the day if convenient, or leave a check for the amount with your bank on the day before your paper matures. Banks will not pay notes or drafts without instructions.</p><p>Keep a careful record of the days of maturity of all your paper. Banks usually notify all payers a few days beforehand when their paper matures, but this is only courtesy on their part and not an obligation.</p><p>Exchange.</p><p>&quot;Exchange&quot; means funds in other cities made available by bankers&#39; drafts on such places. These drafts afford the safest and cheapest means for remitting money. Drafts on New York are worth their face value practically all over the United States in settlement of accounts.</p><p>Collections.</p><p>A draft is sometimes the most convenient form for collecting an account. The prevalence of the custom is due to the fact that most men will wait to be asked to pay a debt. If a draft is a time draft it is accepted by the person on whom it is drawn by writing his name and date across the face. This makes it practically a note, to be paid at maturity.</p><p>Notes or drafts that you desire to have collected for you by your bank should be left at the bank several days before they are due, so as to give ample time to notify the payers.</p><p>Borrowing.</p><p>Banks are always willing to loan their funds to responsible persons within reasonable limits. That is what they exist for. There is, of course, a limit to the amount a bank may loan, even on the best known security, but the customer of the bank is entitled to and will receive the first consideration.</p><p>The customer should not hesitate, when occasion requires, to offer to the bank for discount such paper as may come into his hands in the course of business, if, in his opinion, the paper is good. At the same time he should not be offended if his bank refuses to take it even without giving reasons.</p><p>Indorsing Checks, Etc.</p><p>When depositing checks, drafts, etc., see that they are dated properly and that the written amounts and figures correspond. The proper way to indorse a check or draft--this also applies to notes and other negotiable paper--is to write your name upon the back about one inch from the top. The proper end may be determined in this way: As you read the check, holding one end in each hand, draw the right hand toward you, and turn the check over. The end which is then farthest from you is the top. If, however, the check, draft or note has already been indorsed by another person, you should write your name directly under the other indorsement, even if that is on the wrong end. If your own name on the face of the check, draft or note is misspelled, or has the wrong initials, but if the paper is clearly intended for you, you should first write your name as it appears on the face, and under it your regular signature. You should indorse every check you deposit, even though it be payable to bearer.</p><p>Mistakes in Banking.</p><p>Mr. Samuel Woods, a member of the American Institute of Bank Clerks, recently contributed to Munsey&#39;s Magazine an interesting article on the subject of &quot;Mistakes in Banking.&quot; From this we are permitted by the courtesy of the publishers of Munsey&#39;s to reproduce two of the facsimiles shown.</p><p>One wrong word, or figure, or letter--the right thing in the wrong way or the wrong place--the scratch of an eraser or the alteration of a word--or any one of these things, in the making or cashing of a check, is liable to become as expensive as a racing automobile.</p><p>The paying teller of a bank, says Mr. Woods, must keep his eyes open for new dangers as well as old ones. The cleverest crooks in the country are pitting their brains against his. After he has learned the proper guard for all the well-known tricks and forgeries it is still possible that an entirely new combination may leave him minus cash and plus experience.</p><p>But it is not the unique and novel swindle that is most dangerous, either to a bank or an individual. It is the simple, ordinary mistake or the time-worn trick that makes continuous trouble. Apparently, every new generation contains a number of dishonest people who lay the same traps, and a number of careless people who fall into these traps in the same old way.</p><p>Check-Raising Made Easy.</p><p>One of the first lessons, for instance, that a depositor should learn before he is qualified to own a check-book is to commence writing the amount as near as possible to the extreme left of the check. Those who forget this are often reminded of it in a costly way. Some one &quot;raises&quot; their checks by writing another figure in front of the proper amount. &quot;Five hundred&quot; might be &quot;raised&quot; to &quot;twenty-five hundred&quot; in this way, even by an unskilled forger.</p><p>The highest court has recently decided that a bank cannot be held responsible, when it pays a &quot;raised&quot; check, if the maker of the check failed in the first place to write it out correctly. The treasurer of the Bath Electric Company, of Bath, Maine, had written a check for one hundred dollars, which was raised to eighty-one hundred dollars and cashed. The court held that the company, and not the bank, should lose the eight thousand dollars, because of the &quot;gross carelessness&quot; in drawing up the check. Facsimiles showing the check as originally written and as it looked when paid are here reproduced.</p><p>Altered Words and Figures.</p><p>The altered check is the bane of the paying teller&#39;s profession, and it is the general practice in conservative banks to accept no checks or other paper which shows signs of erasure or alteration in either words or figures.</p><p>THE NAMES OF THE STATES.</p><p>Alabama--Indian; meaning &quot;Here we rest.&quot;</p><p>Arkansas&quot;--Kansas,&quot; the Indian name for &quot;smoky water,&quot; with the French prefix &quot;arc,&quot; bow or bend in the principal river.</p><p>California--Caliente Fornala, Spanish for &quot;hot furnace,&quot; in allusion to the climate.</p><p>Colorado--Spanish; meaning &quot;colored,&quot; from the red color of the Colorado river.</p><p>Connecticut--Indian; meaning &quot;long river.&quot;</p><p>Delaware--Named in honor of Lord De La Ware.</p><p>Florida--Named by Ponce de Leon, who discovered it in 1512, on Easter Day, the Spanish Pascua de Flores, or &quot;Feast of Flowers.&quot;</p><p>Georgia--In honor of George II. of England.</p><p>Illinois--From the Indian &quot;illini,&quot; men, and the French suffix &quot;ois,&quot; together signifying &quot;tribe of men.&quot;</p><p>Indiana--Indian land.

It is not a philosophy, for it will have nothing to do with philosophical methods; it might be called a religion, though it has never had a following large enough to make a very strong impression on the world&#39;s religious history. The name is from the Greek word theosophia--divine wisdom--and the object of theosophical study is professedly to understand the nature of divine things. It differs, however, from both philosophy and theology even when these have the same object of investigation. For, in seeking to learn the divine nature and attributes, philosophy employs the methods and principles of natural reasoning; theology uses these, adding to them certain principles derived from revelation. Theosophy, on the other hand, professes to exclude all reasoning processes as imperfect, and to derive its knowledge from direct communication with God himself. It does not, therefore, accept the truths of recorded revelation as immutable, but as subject to modification by later and personal revelations. The theosophical idea has had followers from the earliest times. Since the Christian era we may class among theosophists such sects as Neo-Platonists, the Hesychasts of the Greek Church, the Mystics of mediaeval times, and, in later times, the disciples of Paracelsus, Thalhauser, Bohme, Swedenborg and others. Recently a small sect has arisen, which has taken the name of Theosophists. Its leader was an English gentleman who had become fascinated with the doctrine of Buddhism. Taking a few of his followers to India, they have been prosecuting their studies there, certain individuals attracting considerable attention by a claim to miraculous powers. It need hardly be said that the revelations they have claimed to receive have been, thus far, without element of benefit to the human race.</p><p>THE EVOLUTION THEORY.</p><p>The evolution or development theory declares the universe as it now exists to be the result of a long series of changes which were so far related to each other as to form a series of growths analogous to the evolving of the parts of a growing organism. Herbert Spencer defines evolution as a progress from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, from general to special, from the simple to the complex elements of life, and it is believed that this process can be traced in the formation of worlds in space, in the multiplication of types and species among animals and plants, in the origin and changes of languages and literature and the arts, and also in all the changes of human institutions and society. Asserting the general fact of progress in nature, the evolution theory shows that the method of this progress has been (1) by the multiplication of organs and functions; (2) according to a defined unity of plan, although with (3) intervention of transitional forms, and (4) with modifications dependent upon surrounding conditions. Ancient writers occasionally seemed to have a glimmering knowledge of the fact of progress in nature, but as a theory &quot;evolution&quot; belongs to the enlightenment of the nineteenth century. Leibnitz, in the latter part of the seventeenth century first uttered the opinion that the earth was once in a fluid condition and Kant about the middle of the eighteenth century, definitely propounded the nebular hypothesis, which was enlarged as a theory by the Herschels. The first writer to suggest the transmutation of species among animals was Buffon, about 1750, and other writers followed out the idea. The eccentric Lord Monboddo was the first to suggest the possible descent of man from the ape, about 1774. In 1813 Dr. W. C. Wells first proposed to apply the principle of natural selection to the natural history of man, and in 1822 Professor Herbert first asserted the probable transmutation of species of plants. In 1844 a book appeared called &quot;Vestiges of Creation,&quot; which, though evidently not written by a scientific student, yet attracted great attention by its bold and ingenious theories. The authorship of this book was never revealed until after the death of Robert Chambers, a few years since, it became known that this publisher, whom no one would ever have suspected of holding such heterodox theories, had actually written it. But the two great apostles of the evolution theory were Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. The latter began his great work, the &quot;First Principles of Philosophy,&quot; showing the application of evolution in the facts of life, in 1852. In 1859 appeared Darwin&#39;s &quot;Origin of Species.&quot; The hypothesis of the latter was that different species originated in spontaneous variation, and the survival of the fittest through natural selection and the struggle for existence. This theory was further elaborated and applied by Spencer, Darwin, Huxley, and other writers in Europe and America, and though to-day by no means all the ideas upheld by these early advocates of the theory are still accepted, evolution as a principle is now acknowledged by nearly all scientists. It is taken to be an established fact in nature, a valid induction from man&#39;s knowledge of natural order.</p><p>THE ENGLISH SPARROW.</p><p>The first English sparrow was brought to the United States in 1850, but it was not until 1870 that the species can be said to have firmly established itself. Since then it has taken possession of the country. Its fecundity is amazing. In the latitude of New York and southward it hatches, as a rule, five or six broods in a season, with from four to six young in a brood. Assuming the average annual product of a pair to be twenty-four young, of which half are females and half males, and assuming further, for the sake of computation, that all live, together with their offspring, it will be seen that in ten years the progeny of a single pair would be 275,716,983,698.</p><p>FEMININE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT.</p><p>It is often asked how stout a woman ought to be in proportion to her height. A very young girl may becomingly be thinner than a matron, but the following table gives a fair indication of proper proportions:</p><p>Height Pounds Height Pounds Five feet about 100 Five feet 7 inches. about 150 Five feet 1 inch about 106 Five feet 8 inches. about 155 Five feet 2 inches about 113 Five feet 10 inches. about 163 Five feet 3 inches about 119 Five feet 10 inches. about 169 Five feet 4 inches about 130 Five feet 11 inches. about 176 Five feet 5 inches about 138 Six feet about 180 Five feet 6 inches about 144 Six feet 1 inch about 186</p><p>WHEN A MAN BECOMES OF AGE.</p><p>The question sometimes arises whether it man is entitled to vote at an election held on the day preceding the twenty-first anniversary of his birth. Blackstone, in his Commentaries, book 1, page 463, says: &quot;Full age in male or female is 21 years, which age is completed on the day preceding the anniversary of a person&#39;s birth, who, till that time, is an infant, and so styled in law.&quot; The late Chief Justice Sharswood, in his edition of Blackstone&#39;s Commentaries, quotes Christian&#39;s note on the above as follows: &quot;If he is born on the 16th day of February, 1608, he is of age to do any legal act on the morning of the 15th of February, 1629, though he may not have lived twenty-one years by nearly forty-eight hours. The reason assigned is that in law there is no fraction of a day; and if the birth were on the last second of one day and the act on the first second of the preceding day twenty-one years after, then twenty-one years would be complete, and in the law it is the same whether a thing is done upon one moment of the day or another.&quot;</p><p>DREAMS AND THEIR MEANING</p><p>The Bible speaks of dreams as being sometimes prophetic, or suggestive of future events.</p><p>This belief has prevailed in all ages and countries, and there are numerous modern examples, apparently authenticated, which would appear to favor this hypothesis.</p><p>The interpretation of dreams was a part of the business of the soothsayers at the royal courts of Egypt, Babylon and other ancient nations.</p><p>Dreams and visions have attracted the attention of mankind of every age and nation. It has been claimed by all nations, both enlightened and heathen, that dreams are spiritual revelations to men; so much so, that their modes of worship have been founded upon the interpretation of dreams and visions. Why should we discard the interpretation of dreams while our mode of worship, faith and knowledge of Deity are founded upon the interpretation of the dreams and visions of the prophets and seers of old.</p><p>Dreams vividly impressed upon the mind are sure to be followed by some event.</p><p>We read in the Holy Scripture the revelation of the Deity to His chosen people, through the prophet Joel: &quot;And it shall come to pass, afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions, and also upon the servants and the handmaids in those days will I pour out My Spirit.&quot; (Joel ii, 28.)</p><p>Both sacred and profane history contain so many examples of the fulfilment of dreams that he who has no faith in them must be very skeptical indeed.</p><p>Hippocrates says that when the body is asleep the soul is awake, and transports itself everywhere the body would be able to go; knows and sees all that the body could see or know were it awake; that it touches all that the body could touch. In a word, it performs all the actions that the body of a sleeping man could do were he awake.</p><p>A dream, to have a significance, must occur to the sleeper while in healthy and tranquil sleep. Those dreams of which we have not a vivid conception, or clear remembrance, have no significance.</p><p>Those of which we have a clear remembrance must have formed in the mind in the latter part of the night, for up to that time the faculties of the body have been employed in digesting the events of the day.</p><p>DICTIONARY OF DREAMS.</p><p>(Note.--If you do not find the word you want, look for a word of identical or closely similar meaning.)</p><p>A</p><p>Abundance--Deceitful security.</p><p>Accident--Unexpected meeting.</p><p>Acorn--Irreparable fault.</p><p>Account--(Of possessions) bankruptcy.</p><p>Adultery--(That you commit) scandal, misfortune and disgrace.</p><p>Air--(Clear and serene) reconciliation;

Labor faithfully. Be patient.--Elizabeth Stuart Phelps.</p><p>Cultivate accuracy in words and things; amass sound knowledge; avoid all affectation; write all topics which interest you.--F. W. Newman.</p><p>Don&#39;t be afraid. Fight right along. Hope right along.--S.L. Clemens.</p><p>Every good writer has much idiom; it is the life and spirit of Language.--W. S. Landor.</p><p>Follow this: If you write from the heart, you will write to the heart.--Beaconsfield</p><p>Genius may begin great works, but only continued labor completes them.--Joubert.</p><p>Half the writer&#39;s art consists in learning what to leave in the ink-pot.--Stevenson.</p><p>It is by suggestion, not cumulation, that profound impressions are made on the imagination.--Lowell.</p><p>Joy in one&#39;s work is an asset beyond the valuing in mere dollars.--C. D. Warner.</p><p>Keep writing--and profit by criticism. Use for a motto Michael Angelo&#39;s wise words: &quot;Genius is infinite patience.&quot;--L. M. Alcott.</p><p>Lord, let me never tag a moral to a story, nor tell a story without a meaning.--Van Dyke.</p><p>More failures come from vanity than carelessness.--Joseph Jefferson.</p><p>Never do a &quot;pot-boiler.&quot; Let one of your best things go to boil the pot.--&quot;O. Henry.&quot;</p><p>Originality does not mean oddity, but freshness. It means vitality, not novelty.--Norman Hapgood.</p><p>Pluck feathers from the wings of your imagination, and stick them in the tail of your judgment.--Horace Greeley.</p><p>Quintessence approximates genius. Gather much though into few words. --Schopenhauer.</p><p>Revise. Revise. Revise.--E. E. Hale.</p><p>Simplicity has been held a mark of truth: it is also it mark of genius.--Carlyle.</p><p>The first principle of composition of whatever sort is that it should be natural and appear to have happened so.--Frederick Macmonnies.</p><p>Utilize your enthusiasms. Get the habit of happiness in work.--Beveridge.</p><p>Very few voices but sound repellent under violent exertion.--Lessing.</p><p>Whatever in this world one has to say, there is a word, and just one word, to express it. Seek that out and use it.--De Maupassant.</p><p>Yes, yes; believe me, you must draw your pen Not once, nor twice, but o&#39;er and o&#39;er again Through what you&#39;ve written, if you would entice The man who reads you once to read you twice. -Horace (Conington, Tr.)</p><p>Zeal with scanty capacity often accomplishes more than capacity with no zeal at all.--George Eliot.</p><p>WHAT DIFFERENT EYES INDICATE.</p><p>The long, almond-shaped eye with thick eyelids covering nearly half of the pupil, when taken in connection with the full brow, is indicative of genius, and is often found in artists, literary and scientific men. It is the eye of talent, or impressibility. The large, open, transparent eye, of whatever color, is indicative of elegance, of taste, of refinement, of wit, of intelligence. Weakly marked eyebrows indicate a feeble constitution and a tendency to melancholia, Deep sunken eyes are selfish, while eyes in which the whole iris shows indicate erraticism, if not lunacy. Round eyes are indicative of innocence; strongly protuberant eyes of weakness of both mind and body. Eyes small and close together typify cunning, while those far apart and open indicate frankness. The normal distance between the eyes is the width of one eye; a distance greater or less than this intensifies the character supposed to be symbolized. Sharp angles, turning down at the corners of the eyes, are seen in persons of acute judgment and penetration. Well-opened steady eyes belong to the sincere; wide staring eyes to the impertinent.</p><p>THE MYSTERIES OF PALMISTRY</p><p>[Illustration: Various Forms of Fingers and Hands. Nine hands with various markings and eleven fingers.]</p><p>The following points, upon which the Science of Palmistry is based, explain its mysteries, and will be found very interesting, amusing and instructive:</p><p>Form of the Hand.</p><p>Hands are classed into seven types, each of which is illustrated by the cuts on the preceding page, and described as follows:</p><p>Plate I--The Elementary or Bilious Hand, indicating brutal instinct instead of reason as the governing power of the character.</p><p>Plate II--The Square or Jupiter Hand, indicating a practical, stubborn, methodical, and conventional character; one apt to be suspicious of strangers and radical in views.</p><p>Plate III--The Spatulate or Nervous Hand, so named because of its imagined resemblance to a spatula. It is broad at the base of the fingers, and indicates great energy and push to discover; also, courage and fearlessness.</p><p>Plate IV--The Philosophic or Venus Hand, has a long, thin, muscular palm, with long, knotty fingers; indicates a student of nature and searcher after truth.</p><p>Plate V--The Mercury or Artistic Hand, indicates quick temper, impulsiveness; a character that is light-hearted, gay and charitable, to-day; and to-morrow, sad, tearful and uncharitable.</p><p>Plate VI--The Lunar or Idealistic Hand, indicates an extremely sensitive nature.</p><p>Plate VII--The Harmonic or Solar Hand, indicates a character of great versatility, brilliant in conversation, and an adept in diplomacy.</p><p>The Fingers.</p><p>For fortune-telling the fingers from first to fourth are designated as Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo and Mercury.</p><p>Note the cut on preceding page, representing the different types of fingers, numbered from one to eleven.</p><p>1--Large fingers indicate a person of vulgar tastes and a cruel, selfish disposition.</p><p>2--Small, thin fingers indicate a keen, quick acting mind and a person not very particular about personal appearance.</p><p>3--Long, lean fingers indicate an inquiring disposition; love of details in narrative; short fingers imply simple tastes and selfishness.</p><p>4--Fat fingers, largely developed at base, indicate sensualness; if small at base, the reverse.</p><p>5--Smooth fingers indicate artistic ability.</p><p>6--Knotty fingers indicate truthfulness and good order in business affairs.</p><p>7--Pointed fingers indicate a very magnetic and enthusiastic personality.</p><p>8--Square fingers indicate a strong mind, regularity and love of good order.</p><p>9--Spatulate fingers indicate a character of positiveness in opinions and lacking in gentleness.</p><p>10--Fingers of mixed shape indicate a harmonious disposition, with ability to easily adapt oneself to all conditions.</p><p>11--Obtuse fingers indicate coarse and cruel sensibilities.</p><p>The Phalanges of the Fingers.</p><p>See plate VIII, 1, 2, 3--The Phalanges of the Thumb: 4, 5, 6--Repeated on each finger, indicate the phalanges of the four fingers.</p><p>The Mounts of the Hands.</p><p>See plate IX--A, Mount Venus; B, Mount Jupiter; C, Mount Saturn; D, Mount Apollo; E. Mount Mercury; F, Mount Luna; G, Mount Mars.</p><p>The Shape and Length of the Phalanges represent certain qualities and features of character, as presented in the following:</p><p>Jupiter, the first finger; if the first phalange is longer than the second, it indicates ability to control others, direct and maintain order; if the second phalange is long and well developed, it indicates leadership; if short and thin, intellectual weakness; if the third phalange is long, it indicates love of power in material things.</p><p>Saturn, second finger; if the first phalange is longer than the second, it indicates ability for mastering scientific subjects; if the second phalange is long, it indicates great interest in subjects requiring deep study; if the third phalange is long, it indicates a love of metaphysics and money.</p><p>Apollo, third finger; if the first phalange is longer than the second, it indicates love of the arts; if the second phalange is long, it indicates success and love of riches; if the third phalange is thick, it indicates an inherited talent of the arts.</p><p>Mercury, fourth finger; if the first phalange is longer than the second, it indicates a taste for and love of research; if the second phalange is long and well developed, it indicates industrious habits; if the third phalange is long and fat, it indicates a desire for the comforts of life.</p><p>The Mountains.</p><p>These are points or elevations on the palm.</p><p>Mount Venus, if prominent, indicates a person of strong passions, great energy in business, and admiration of physical beauty in the opposite sex; it also indicates love of children, home and wife, or husband. When not well developed there is a lack of love for home, children, wife or husband; and in a man, it indicates egotism and laziness,--in a woman, hysteria.</p><p>Mount Jupiter, if prominent, indicates a person who is generous, loves power, and is brilliant in conversation; if a woman, she desires to shine and be a social leader. When not well developed, it indicates lack of self-esteem, slovenliness and indifference to personal appearance.</p><p>Mount Saturn, if prominent, indicates a serious-minded person, religiously inclined, slow to reach a conclusion, very prudent, free in the expression of opinions, but inclined to be pessimistic.</p><p>Mount Apollo, if prominent, indicates ability as an artist, generosity, courageousness, and a poetical nature, apt to be a spendthrift. When not well developed, it indicates cautiousness and prudence.</p><p>Mount Mercury, if prominent, indicates keen perceptions, cleverness in conversation, a talent for the sciences, industry, and deceitfulness. If not well developed, it indicates a phlegmatic, stupid disposition.</p><p>Mount Luna, if prominent, indicates a dreamy, changeable, capricious, enthusiastic, and inventive nature. When not well developed, it indicates constancy, love of home, and ability to imitate others.</p><p>Mount Mars, if prominent, indicates self-respect, coolness, and control of self under trying circumstances, courage, venturesomeness and confidence in one&#39;s ability for anything undertaken. When not well developed, it indicates the opposite of these characteristics.</p><p>Lines On the Hand.</p><p>If the lines of the hand are not well defined, this fact indicates poor health.</p><p>Deep red lines indicate good, robust health. Yellow lines indicate excessive biliousness.</p><p>Dark-colored lines indicate a melancholy and reserved disposition.</p><p>The Life Line extends from the outer base of Mount Jupiter, entirely around the base of Mount Venus. If chained under Jupiter, it indicates bad health in early life. Hair lines extending from it imply weakness, and if cut by small lines from Mount Venus, misplaced affections and domestic broils. If arising from Mount Jupiter, an ambition to be wealthy and learned. If it is joined by the Line of the Head at its beginning, prudence and wisdom are indicated. If it joins Heart and Head line&#39;s at its commencement, a great catastrophe will be experienced by the person so marked. A square on it denotes success. All lines that follow it give it strength. Lines that cut the Life Line extending through the Heart Line denote interference in a love affair. If it is crossed by small lines, illness is indicated. Short and badly drawn lines, unequal in size, imply bad blood and a tendency to fevers.</p><p>The Heart Line, if it extends across the hand at the base of the finger mounts, and is deep and well defined, indicates purity and devotion; if well defined from Mount Jupiter only, a jealous and tyrannical disposition is indicated; if it begins at Mount Saturn and is without branches, it is a fatal sign; if short and well defined in the Harmonic type of hand it indicates intense affection when it is reciprocated; if short on the Mercury type of hand, it implies deep interest in intellectual pursuits; it short and deep in the Elementary type of hand, it implies the disposition to satisfy desire by brutal force, instead of by love.</p><p>The Head Line is parallel to Heart Line and forms the second branch of letter M, generally very plain in most hands; if long and deep it indicates ability to care for one&#39;s self; if hair lines are attached to it, mental worry; if it divides toward Mount Mercury love affairs will be first, and business secondary; if well defined its whole length, it implies a well-balanced brain; a line from it extending into a star on Mount Jupiter, great versatility, pride and love for knowledge are indicated; if it extend to Mount Luna interest in occult studies is implied; separated from the Life Line, indicates aggressiveness; if it is broken, death is indicated from an injury in the head.</p><p>The Rascettes are lines across the wrist where the palm joins it.</p><p>It is claimed they indicate length of life; if straight it is a good sign. One Rascette indicates thirty years of life; two lines, sixty; three lines, ninety.</p><p>The Fate Line commences at Rascettes, and if it extends straight to Mount Saturn, uninterrupted, and alike in both hands, good luck and success are realized without personal exertion. If not in one hand and interrupted in the other, success will be experienced only by great effort. If well defined at the wrist the early life is bright and promising; if broken in the center, misery for middle life is indicated. If this line touches Mounts Luna and Venus, it indicates a good disposition and wealth; if inclined toward any mount, it implies success in that line for which the mount stands. If it is made up of disconnected links, it indicates serious physical and moral struggles. Should it end at Heart Line, the life has been ruined by unrequited love. If it runs through a square, the life has been in danger and saved. Should it merge into the Heart Line and continue to Mount Jupiter, it denotes distinction and power secured through love.</p><p>The Girdle of Venus is a curved line extending from Mount Jupiter to Mercury, encircling Saturn and Apollo. It appears on few hands, but it indicates superior intellect, a sensitive and capricious nature; if it extends to base of Jupiter it denotes divorce; ending in Mercury, implies great energy; should it be cut by parallel lines in a man, it indicates a hard drinker and gambler.</p><p>Lines of Reputation, commencing in the middle of the hand, at the Head Line, Mount Luna or Mount Mars, indicate financial success from intellectual pursuits after years of struggling with adversity. If from Heart Line, real love of occupation and success; if from Head Line, success from selfishness. An island on this line denotes loss of character, a start on it near Apollo implies that success will be permanent, and a square, brilliant success. The absence of this line implies a struggle for recognition of one&#39;s abilities.</p><p>Line of Intuition, beginning at base of Mount Mercury, extends around Mars and Luna; it is frequently found in the Venus, Mercury and Lunar types of hands; when deeply dented with a triangle on Mount Saturn it denotes clairvoyant power; if it forms a triangle with Fate Line, or Life Line, a voyage will be taken.</p><p>Health Line commences at center of the Rascettes, takes an oblique course from Fate Line, ending toward Mount Mercury. If straight and well defined, there is little liability to constitutional diseases; when it does not extend to Head Line, steady mental labor cannot be performed; when it is broad and deep on Mount Mercury, diminishing as it enters the Life Line, death from heart disease is indicated; small lines cutting it denote sickness from biliousness. When joined to Heart Line, health and business are neglected for Love; if made up of short, fine lines, there is suffering from stomach catarrh; if it is checked by islands there is a constitutional tendency to lung disease.</p><p>Marriage Lines extend straight across Mount Mercury; if short, affairs of the heart without marriage are denoted. When near Heart Line early marriage is indicated; if it turns directly to Heart Line, marriage will occur between the ages of 16 and 21; if close to the top of the mount, marriage will not take place before the 35th year; if it curves upward it indicates a single life; when pronged and running toward the center or to Mount Mars, divorce will occur. If the end at this line droops the subject will outlive wife or husband; if broken, divorce is implied; if it ends in a cross, the wife or husband will die from an accident. A branch from this line upward implies a high position attained by marriage. A black spot on this line means widowhood.</p><p>Children&#39;s Lines are small and upright, extending from the end of Marriage Lines. If broad and well defined, males; if fine and narrow, females are indicated. A line of this order that is deep and well defined denotes prominence for that child.</p><p>Small Lines have a signification depending upon their position and number.</p><p>A single line on Jupiter signifies success; on Saturn, happiness; on Apollo, fame and talent.</p><p>Ascending small lines are favorable, while descending lines are unfavorable signs.</p><p>Several small lines on Mars indicate warfare constantly.</p><p>Cross lines, failure.</p><p>RIDDLES, OLD AND NEW.</p><p>Feet have they, but they walk not--stoves.</p><p>Eyes have they, but they see not--potatoes.</p><p>Noses have they, but they smell not--tea-pots.</p><p>Mouths have they, but they taste not--rivers.</p><p>Hands have they, but they handle not--clocks.</p><p>Ears have they, but they hear not--corn stalks.</p><p>Tongues have they, but they talk not--wagons.</p><p>What thing is that which is lengthened by being cut at both ends?

Thus, a person wishing to express his intention of going to a given place says, &quot;I propose going,&quot; when, in fact, he purposes going. The following affords an amusing illustration of this class of error: A venerable matron was speaking of her son, who, she said, was quite stage-struck: &quot;In fact,&quot; remarked the old lady, &quot;he is going to a premature performance this evening!&quot; Considering that most amateur performances are premature, it cannot be said that this word was altogether misapplied, though, evidently, the maternal intention was to convey quite another meaning.</p><p>Other errors arise from the substitution of sounds similar to the words which should be employed; that is, spurious words instead of genuine ones. Thus, some people say &quot;renumerative,&quot; when they mean &quot;remunerative.&quot; A nurse, recommending her mistress to have a perambulator for her child, advised her to purchase a preamputator!</p><p>Other errors are occasioned by imperfect knowledge of English grammar; thus, many people say, &quot;Between you and I,&quot; instead of &quot;Between you and me.&quot; And there are numerous other departures from the rules of grammar, which will be pointed out hereafter.</p><p>Misuse of the Adjective--&quot;What beautiful butter!&quot; &quot;What a nice landscape!&quot; They should say, &quot;What a beautiful landscape!&quot; &quot;What nice butter!&quot; Again, errors are frequently occasioned by the following causes:</p><p>Mispronunciation of Words--Many persons say pronoun-ciation instead of pronunciation; others say pro-nun-ce-a-shun, instead of pro-nun-she-a-shun.</p><p>Misdivision of Words and Syllables--This defect makes the words an ambassador sound like a nambassador, or an adder like a nadder.</p><p>Imperfect Enunciation--As when a person says hebben for heaven, ebber for ever, jocholate for chocolate.</p><p>To correct these errors by a systematic course of study would involve a closer application than most persons could afford, but the simple and concise rules and hints here given, founded upon usage and the authority of scholars, will be of great assistance to inquirers.</p><p>ENGLISH GRAMMAR IN A NUTSHELL.</p><p>Who and whom are used in relation to persons, and which in relation to things. But it was once common to say, &quot;the man which.&quot; This should now be avoided. It is now usual to say, &quot;Our Father who art in heaven,&quot; instead of &quot;which art in heaven.&quot;</p><p>Whose is, however, sometimes applied to things as well as to persons. We may therefore say, &quot;The country whose inhabitants are free.&quot;</p><p>Thou is employed in solemn discourse, and you in common language. Ye (plural) is also used in serious addresses, and you in familiar language.</p><p>The uses of the word it are various, and very perplexing to the uneducated. It is not only used to imply persons, but things, and even ideas, and therefore in speaking or writing, its assistance is constantly required. The perplexity respecting this word arises from the fact that in using it in the construction of a long sentence, sufficient care is not taken to insure that when it is employed it really points out or refers to the object intended. For instance, &quot;It was raining when John set out in his cart to go to market, and he was delayed so long that it was over before he arrived.&quot; Now what is to be understood by this sentence: Was the rain over? or the market? Either or both might be inferred from the construction of the sentence, which, therefore, should be written thus: &quot;It was raining when John set out in his cart to go to market, and he was delayed so long that the market was over before he arrived.&quot;</p><p>Rule--After writing a sentence always look through it, and see that wherever the word it is employed, it refers to or carries the mind back to the object which it is intended to point out.</p><p>The general distinction between this and that may be thus defined: this denotes an object present or near, in time or place; that something which is absent.</p><p>These refers, in the same manner, to present objects, while those refers to things that are remote.</p><p>Who changes, under certain conditions, into whose and whom; but that and which always remain the same, with the exception of the possessive case, as noted above.</p><p>That may be applied to nouns or subjects of all sorts; as, the girl that went to school, the dog that bit me, the opinion that he entertains.</p><p>The misuse of these pronouns gives rise to more errors in speaking and writing than any other cause.</p><p>When you wish to distinguish between two or more persons, say: &quot;Which is the happy man?&quot; not who--&quot;Which of those ladies to you admire?&quot;</p><p>Instead of &quot;Whom do you think him to be?&quot; say, &quot;Who do you think him to be?&quot;</p><p>Whom should I see.</p><p>To whom do you speak?</p><p>Who said so?</p><p>Who gave it to you?</p><p>Of whom did you procure them?</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>Who do men say that I am?</p><p>Self should never be added to his, their, mine or thine.</p><p>Each is used to denote every individual of a number.</p><p>Every denotes all the individuals of a number.</p><p>Either and or denote an alternative: &quot;I will take either road, at your pleasure;&quot; &quot;I will take this or that.&quot;</p><p>Neither means not either, and nor means not the other. Either is sometimes used for each--&quot;Two thieves were crucified, on either side one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let each esteem others as good as themselves,&quot; should be, &quot;Let each esteem others as good as himself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are bodies each of which are so small,&quot; should be, &quot;each of which is so small.&quot;</p><p>Do not use double superlatives, such as most straightest, most highest, most finest.</p><p>The term worser has gone out of use; but lesser is stilt retained.</p><p>The use of such words as chiefest, extreamest, etc., has become obsolete, because they do not give any superior force to the meanings of the primary words, chief, extreme, etc.</p><p>Such expressions as more impossible, more indispensable, more universal, more uncontrollable, more unlimited, etc., are objectionable, as they really enfeeble the meaning which it is the object of the speaker or writer to strengthen. For instance, impossible gains no strength by rendering it more impossible. This class of error is common with persons who say, &quot;A great large house,&quot; &quot;A great big animal,&quot; &quot;A little small foot,&quot; &quot;A tiny little hand.&quot;</p><p>Here, there and where, originally denoting place, may now, by common consent, be used to denote other meanings, such as, &quot;There I agree with you,&quot; &quot;Where we differ,&quot; &quot;We find pain where we expected pleasure,&quot; &quot;Here you mistake me.&quot;</p><p>Hence, whence and thence, denoting departure, etc., may be used without the word from. The idea of from is included in the word whence--therefore it is unnecessary to say &quot;From whence.&quot;</p><p>Hither, thither and whither, denoting to a place, have generally been superseded by here, there and where. But there is no good reason why they should not be employed. If, however, they are used, it is unnecessary to add the word to, because that is implied--&quot;Whither are you going?&quot; &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Each of these sentences is complete. To say, &quot;Where are you going to?&quot; is redundant.</p><p>Two negatives destroy each other, and produce an affirmative. &quot;Nor did he not observe them,&quot; conveys the idea that he did observe them.</p><p>But negative assertions are allowable. &quot;His manners are not impolite,&quot; which implies that his manners are in some degree marked by politeness.</p><p>Instead of &quot;Let you and I.&quot; say &quot;Let you and me.&quot;</p><p>Instead of &quot;I am not so tall as him,&quot; say &quot;I am not so tall as he.&quot;</p><p>When asked &quot;Who is there?&quot; do not answer &quot;Me,&quot; but &quot;I,&quot;</p><p>Instead of &quot;For you and I,&quot; say &quot;For you and me.&quot;</p><p>Instead of &quot;Says I,&quot;

This mark in printing denotes the syllable upon which the stress or force of the voice should be placed.</p><p>A word may have more than one accent. Take as an instance aspiration. In uttering the word we give a marked emphasis of the voice upon the first and third syllables, and therefore those syllables are said to be accented. The first of these accents is less distinguishable than the second, upon which we dwell longer; therefore the second accent in point of order is called the primary, or chief accent of the word.</p><p>When the full accent falls on a vowel, that vowel should have a long sound, as in vo&#39;cal; but when it falls on or after a consonant, the preceding vowel has a short sound, as in hab&#39;it.</p><p>To obtain a good knowledge of pronunciation it is advisable for the reader to listen to the examples given by good speakers, and by educated persons. We learn the pronunciation of words, to a great extent, by imitation, just as birds acquire the notes of other birds which may be near them.</p><p>But it will be very important to bear in mind that there are many words having a double meaning or application, and that the difference of meaning is indicated by the difference of the accent, Among these words, nouns are distinguished from verbs by this means: nouns are mostly accented on the first syllabic, and verbs on the last.</p><p>Noun signifies name; nouns are the names of persons and things, as well as of things not material and palpable, but of which we have a conception and knowledge, such as courage, firmness, goodness, strength; and verbs express actions, movements, etc. If the word used signifies has been done, or is being done, or is, or is to be done, then that word is a verb.</p><p>Thus when we say that anything is &quot;an in&#39;sult,&quot; that word is a noun, and is accented all the first syllable; but when we say he did it &quot;to insult&#39; another person,&quot; that word insult&#39; implies acting, and becomes a verb, and should be accented on the last syllable.</p><p>Simple Rules of Pronunciation.</p><p>C before a, o and u, and in some other situations, is a close articulation, like k. Before e, i and y, c is precisely equivalent to s in same, this; as in cedar, civil, cypress, capacity.</p><p>E final indicates that the preceding vowel is long; as in hate, mete, sire, robe, lyre, abate, recede, invite, remote, intrude.</p><p>E final indicates that c preceding has the sound of s; as in lace, lance, and that g preceding has the sound of j, as in charge, page, challenge.</p><p>E final in proper English words never forms a syllable, and in the most used words in the terminating unaccented syllables it is silent. Thus, motive, genuine, examine, granite, are pronounced motiv, genuin, examin, granit.</p><p>E final, in a few words of foreign origin, forms a syllable; as syncope, simile.</p><p>E final is silent after l in the following terminations: ble, cle, dle, fle, gle, kle, ple, tle, zle; as in able, manacle, cradle, ruffle, mangle, wrinkle, supple, rattle, puzzle, which are pronounced a&#39;bl, mana&#39;cl, cra&#39;dl, ruf&#39;fl, man&#39;gl, wrin&#39;kl, sup&#39;pl, puz&#39;zl.</p><p>E is usually silent in the termination en; as in taken, broken; pronounced takn, brokn. OUS, in the termination of adjectives and their derivatives, is pronounced us; as is gracious, pious, pompously.</p><p>CE, CI, TI, before a vowel, have the sound of sh; as in cetaceous, gracious, motion, partial, ingratiate; pronounced cetashus, grashus, moshun, parshal, ingrashiate.</p><p>SI, after an accented vowel, is pronounced like zh; as in Ephesian, coufusion; pronounced Ephezhan, confushon.</p><p>GH, both in the middle and at the end of words is silent; as in caught, bought, fright, nigh, sigh; pronounced caut, baut, frite, ni, si. In the following exceptions, however, gh is pronounced as f: cough, chough, clough, enough, laugh, rough, slough, tough, trough.</p><p>When WH begins a word, the aspirate h precedes w in pronunciation: as in what, whiff, whale; pronounced hwat, hwiff, hwale, w having precisely the sound of oo, French ou. In the following words w is silent:---who, whom, whose, whoop, whole.</p><p>H after r has no sound or use; as in rheum, rhyme; pronounced reum, ryme.</p><p>H should be sounded in the middle of words; as in forehead, abhor, behold, exhaust, inhabit, unhorse.</p><p>H should always be sounded except in the following words:--heir, herb, honest, honor, hour, humor, and humble, and all their derivatives,--such as humorously, derived from humor.</p><p>K and G are silent before n; as know, gnaw; pronounced no, naw.</p><p>W before r is silent; as in wring, wreath; pronounced ring, reath.</p><p>B after m is silent; as in dumb, numb; pronounced dum, num.</p><p>L before k is silent; as in balk, walk, talk; pronounced bauk, wauk, tauk.</p><p>PH has the sound of f; as in philosophy; pronounced filosofy.</p><p>NG has two sounds, one as in singer, the other as in fin-ger.</p><p>N after m, and closing a syllable, is silent; as in hymn, condemn.</p><p>P before s and t is mute; as in psalm, pseudo, ptarmigan; pronounced salm, sudo, tarmigan.</p><p>R has two sounds, one strong and vibrating, as at the beginning of words and syllables, such as robber, reckon, error; the other is at the termination of the words, or when succeeded by a consonant, as farmer, morn.</p><p>Common Errors in Pronunciation.</p><p>--ace, is not iss, as furnace, not furniss.</p><p>--age, not idge, as cabbage, courage, postage, village.</p><p>--ain, ane, not in, as certain, certane, not certin.</p><p>--ate, not it, as moderate, not moderit.</p><p>--ect, not ec, as aspect, not aspec; subject, not subjec.</p><p>--ed, not id, or ud, as wicked, not wickid or wickud.</p><p>--el, not l, model, not modl; novel, not novl.</p><p>--en, not n, as sudden, not suddn.--Burden, burthen, garden, lengthen, seven, strengthen, often, and a few others, have the e silent.</p><p>--ence, not unce, as influence, not influ-unce.</p><p>--es, not is, as pleases, not pleasis.</p><p>--ile should be pronounced il, as fertil, not fertile, in all words except chamomile (cam), exile, gentile, infantile, reconcile, and senile, which should be pronounced ile.</p><p>--in, not n, as Latin, not Latn.</p><p>--nd, not n, as husband, not husban; thousand, not thousan.</p><p>--ness, not niss, as carefulness, not carefulniss.</p><p>--ng, not n, as singing, not singin; speaking, not speakin.</p><p>--ngth, not nth, as strength, not strenth.</p><p>--son, the o should be silent; as in treason, tre-zn, not tre-son.</p><p>--tal, not tle, as capital, not capitle; metal, not mettle; mortal, not mortle; periodical, not periodicle.</p><p>--xt, not x, as next, not nex.</p><p>SHORT RULES FOR SPELLING.</p><p>Words ending in e drop that letter on taking a suffix beginning with a vowel. Exceptions--words ending in ge, ce, or oe.</p><p>Final e of a primitive word is retained on taking a suffix beginning with a consonant. Exceptions--words ending in dge, and truly, duly, etc.</p><p>Final y of a primitive word, when preceded by a consonant, is generally changed into i on the addition of a suffix. Exceptions--retained before ing and ish, as pitying. Words ending in ie and dropping the e by Rule 1, change the i to y, as lying. Final y is sometimes changed to e, as duteous.</p><p>Nouns ending in y, preceded by a vowel, form their plural by adding s; o as money, moneys. Y preceded by a consonant is changed to ies in the plural; as bounty, bounties.</p><p>Final y of a primitive vowel, preceded by a vowel, should not be changed into i before a suffix; as, joyless.</p><p>In words containing ei or ie, ei is used after the sound s, as ceiling, seize, except in siege and in a few words ending in cier. Inveigle, neither, leisure and weird also have ei. In other cases ie is used, as in believe, achieve.</p><p>Words ending in ceous or cious, when relating to matter, end in ceous; all others in cious.</p><p>Words of one syllable, ending in a consonant; with a single vowel before it, double the consonant in derivatives; as, ship, shipping, etc. But if ending in a consonant with a double vowel before it, they do not double the consonant in derivatives; as troop, trooper, etc.</p><p>Words of more than one syllable, ending in a consonant preceded by a single vowel, and accented on the last syllable, double that consonant in derivatives; as commit, committed; but except chagrin, chagrined; kidnap, kidnaped.</p><p>All words of one syllable ending in l, with a single vowel before it, have ll at the close; as mill, sell.</p><p>All words of one syllable ending in l, with a double vowel before it, have only one l at the close: as mail, sail.</p><p>The words foretell, distill, instill and fulfill retain the double ll of their primitives. Derivatives of dull, skill, will and full also retain the double ll when the accent falls on these words; as dullness, skillful, willful, fullness.</p><p>PUNCTUATION.</p><p>A period (.) after every declarative and every imperative sentence; as, It is true. Do right.</p><p>A period is also used after every abbreviation; as, Dr., Mr., Capt.</p><p>An interrogation point (?) after every question.</p><p>The exclamation point (!) after exclamations; as, Alas!

By Albert Hart.</p><p>Sponges belong to the animal kingdom, and the principal varieties used commercially are obtained off the coasts of Florida and the West Indies; the higher grades are from the Mediterranean Sea, and are numerous in variety.</p><p>A sponge in its natural state is a different-looking object from what we see in commerce, resembling somewhat the appearance of the jelly fish, or a mass of liver, the entire surface being covered with a thin, slimy skin, usually of a dark color, and perforated to correspond with the apertures of the canals commonly called &quot;holes of the sponge.&quot; The sponge of commerce is, in reality, only the skeleton of a sponge. The composition of this skeleton varies in the different kinds of sponges, but in the commercial grades it consists of interwoven horny fibers, among and supporting which are epiculae of silicious matter in greater or less numbers, and having a variety of forms. The fibers consist of a network of fibriles, whose softness and elasticity determine the commercial quality of a given sponge. The horny framework is perforated externally by very minute pores, and by a less number of larger openings. These are parts of an interesting double canal system, an external and an internal, or a centripetal and a centrifugal. At the smaller openings on the sponge&#39;s surface channels begin, which lead into dilated spaces. In these, in turn, channels arise, which eventually terminate in the large openings. Through these channels or canals definite currents are constantly maintained, which are essential to the life of the sponge. The currents enter through the small apertures and emerge through the large ones.</p><p>The active part of the sponge, that is, the part concerned in nutrition and growth, is a soft, fleshy mass, partly filling the meshes and lining the canals. It consists largely of cells having different functions; some utilized in the formation of the framework, some in digestion and others in reproduction. Lining the dilated spaces into which different canals lead are cells surmounted by whip-like processes. The motion of these processes produces and maintains the water currents, which carry the minute food products to the digestive cells in the same cavities. Sponges multiply by the union of sexual product. Certain cells of the fleshy pulp assume the character of ova, and others that of spermatozoa. Fertilization takes place within the sponge. The fertilized eggs, which are called larvae, pass out into the currents of the water, and, in the course of twenty-four to forty-eight hours, they settle and become attached to rocks and other hard substances, and in time develop into mature sponges. The depth of the water in which sponges grow varies from 10 to 50 feet in Florida, but considerably more in the Mediterranean Sea, the finer grades being found in the deepest water, having a temperature of 50 to 57 degrees.</p><p>DON&#39;T BE BURIED ALIVE.</p><p>From time to time we are horrified by learning that some person has been buried alive, after assurances have been given of death. Under these circumstances the opinion of a rising French physician upon the subject becomes of world-wide interest, for since the tests which have been in use for years have been found unreliable no means should be left untried to prove beyond a doubt that life is actually extinct before conveying our loved ones to the grave.</p><p>Dr. Martinot, as reported in the New York Journal, asserts that an unfailing test may be made by producing a blister on the hand or foot of the body by holding the flame of a candle to the same for a few seconds, or until the blister is formed which will always occur. If the blister contains any fluid it is evidence of life, and the blister only that produced by an ordinary burn. If, on the contrary, the blister contains only steam, it may be asserted that life is extinct. The explanation is as follows:</p><p>A corpse, says Dr. Martinot, is nothing more than inert matter, under the immediate control of physical laws which cause all liquid heated to a certain temperature to become steam; the epidermis is raised, the blister produced; it breaks with a little noise, and the steam escapes. But if, in spite of all appearances, there is any remnant of life, the organic mechanism continues to be governed by physiological laws, and the blister will contain serous matter, as in the case of any ordinary burns.</p><p>The test is as simple as the proof is conclusive. Dry blister: death. Liquid blister: life. Any one may try it; there is no error possible.</p><p>HOW TO SERVE WINE.</p><p>A fine dinner may be spoiled by not serving the proper wine at the proper time and at the proper temperature.</p><p>A white wine (Sauterne, Riesling, Moselle, etc.) should be used from the beginning of the meal to the time the roast or game comes on. With the roast serve red wine, either claret or Burgundy.</p><p>Use sparkling wines after the roast.</p><p>With dessert, serve apricot cordial.</p><p>Never serve red wine with soup or fish, and never a white wine with game.</p><p>Storage, Temperature, Etc.</p><p>Store your wines in the cellar at 50 to 60 degrees.</p><p>All bottles should lie flat so that the cork is continually moist.</p><p>This rule should be specially observed with sparkling wines. Sparkling wine should be served ice cold.</p><p>Put the wine on the ice--not ice in the wine.</p><p>Serve red wine at only about 5 degrees cooler than the dining-room.</p><p>White wine should be about 15 degrees cooler than the temperature of the room.</p><p>THE STEPS IN THE GROWTH OF AMERICAN LIBERTY.</p><p>MAGNA CHARTA.</p><p>About seven hundred years ago there was organized a movement which resulted in the great charter of English liberty--a movement which foreshadowed the battle of our American forefathers for political independence. On the 25th of August, 1213, the prelates and Barons, tiring of the tyranny and vacillation of King John, formed a council and passed measures to secure their rights. After two years of contest, with many vicissitudes, the Barons entered London and the King fled into Hampshire. By agreement both parties met at Runnymede on the 9th of June, 1215, and after several days&#39; debate, on June 15, Magna Charta (the Great Charter), the glory of England, was signed and sealed by the sovereign. The Magna Charta is a comprehensive bill of rights, and, though crude in form, and with many clauses of merely local value, its spirit still lives and will live. Clear and prominent we find the motto, &quot;No tax without representation.&quot; The original document is in Latin and contains sixty-one articles, of which the 39th and 40th, embodying the very marrow of our own State constitutions, are here given as translated in the English statutes:</p><p>&quot;39. No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or be disseised of his freehold, or liberties or free customs, or be otherwise destroped [damaged], nor will be press upon him nor seize upon him [condemn him] but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.</p><p>&quot;40. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man, either right or justice.&quot;</p><p>The Great Charter recognizes a popular tribunal as a check on the official judges and may be looked upon as the foundation of the writ of Habeas Corpus. It provides that no one is to be condemned on rumor or suspicion, but only on the evidence of witnesses. It affords protection against excessive emercements, illegal distresses and various processes for debts and service due to the crown. Fines are in all cases to be proportionate to the magnitude of the offense, and even the villein or rustic is not to be deprived of his necessary chattels. There are provisions regarding the forfeiture of land for felony. The testamentary power of the subject is recognized over part of his personal estate, and the rest to be divided between his widow and children. The independence of the church is also provided for. These are the most important features of the Great Charter, which, exacted by men with arms in their hands from a resisting king, occupies so conspicuous a place in history, which establishes the supremacy of the law of England over the will of the monarch, and which still forms the basis of English liberties.</p><p>THE MECKLENBURG DECLARATION</p><p>More than a year before the signing of the Declaration of Independence a document was drawn up that was almost a model in phraseology and sentiment of the great charter of American freedom. There are various accounts of this matter, but the most trustworthy is this:</p><p>At a public meeting of the residents of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, held at Charlotte on the 20th of May, 1775, it was</p><p>&quot;Resolved, That whenever directly or indirectly abetted, or in any way, form or manner countenanced, the unchartered and dangerous invasion of our rights, as claimed by Great Britain, is an enemy to our country--to America--and to the inherent and inalienable rights of man.</p><p>&quot;Resolved, That we, the citizens of Mecklenburg County, do hereby dissolve the political bonds which have connected us to the mother country, and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British crown, and abjure all political connection, contract or association with that nation, which has wantonly trampled on our rights and liberties, and inhumanly shed the blood of American patriots at Lexington.</p><p>&quot;Resolved, That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and independent people; are and of right ought to be a sovereign and self-governing association, under the control of no power other than that of our God and the general government of the Congress. To the maintenance of which independence we solemnly pledge to each other our mutual cooperation, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.&quot;</p><p>There are two other resolutions, concerning the militia and the administration of the law, but these, having no present value, are here omitted.</p><p>THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. In Congress, July 4, 1776.</p><p>When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of Nature and Nature&#39;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p><p>We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.</p><p>He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p><p>He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p><p>He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature--a right inestimable to them, formidable to tyrants only.</p><p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p><p>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p><p>He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large, for their exercise, the state remaining, in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p><p>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising conditions of new appropriation of lands. He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws establishing judiciary powers.</p><p>He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p><p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers, to harass our people, and to eat out their substance.</p><p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.</p><p>He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.</p><p>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:</p><p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us. For protecting them, by mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States.</p><p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world. For imposing taxes on us without our consent.</p><p>For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury.</p><p>For transporting us beyond the seas to be tried for pretended offenses.</p><p>For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies.</p><p>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the forms of our governments.</p><p>For suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p><p>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.</p><p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p><p>He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries, to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p><p>He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.</p><p>He has excited domestic insurrection among us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p><p>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be ruler of a free people.</p><p>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connection and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.

His disease was chronic diarrhoea, superinduced by old age, and his physician said the too free use of the waters of the white sulphur springs.</p><p>James Madison also died of old age, and peacefully, on June 28, 1836. His faculties were undimmed to the last. He was eighty-five.</p><p>James Monroe&#39;s demise, which occurred in the seventy-third year of his age, on July 4, 1831, was assigned to enfeebled health.</p><p>John Quincy Adams was stricken with paralysis on Feb. 21, 1848, while addressing the Speaker of the House of Representatives, being at the time a member of Congress.

He was eighty years of age.</p><p>William Henry Harrison&#39;s death was caused by pleurisy, the result of a cold, which he caught on the day of his inauguration. This was accompanied with severe diarrhoea, which would not yield to medical treatment. He died on April 4, 1841, a month after his inauguration. He was sixty-eight years of age.</p><p>John Tyler died on Jan. 17, 1862, at the age of seventy-two. Cause of death, bilious colic.</p><p>James K.

Loisette, however, is not an inventor, but an introducer. He stands in the same relation to Dr. Pick that the retail dealer holds to the manufacturer: the one produced the article, the other brings it to the public. Even this statement is not quite fair to Loisette, for he has brought much practical common sense to bear upon Pick&#39;s system, and, in preparing the new art of mnemonics for the market, in many ways he has made it his own.</p><p>If each man would reflect upon the method by which he himself remembers things, he would find his hand upon the key of the whole mystery. For instance, I was once trying to remember the word &quot;Blythe.&quot; There occurred to my mind the words &quot;Bellman,&quot; &quot;Belle,&quot; and the verse:</p><p>&quot;---- the peasant upward climbing Hears the bells of Buloss chiming.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Barcarole,&quot; &quot;Barrack,&quot; and so on, until finally the word &quot;Blythe&quot; presented itself with a strange insistence, long after I had ceased trying to recall it.</p><p>On another occasion, when trying to recall the name &quot;Richardson,&quot; I got the words &quot;hay-rick,&quot; &quot;Robertson,&quot; &quot;Randallstown,&quot; and finally &quot;wealthy,&quot; from which, naturally, I got &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;Richardson&quot; almost in a breath.</p><p>Still another example: Trying to recall the name of an old schoolmate, &quot;Grady,&quot; I got &quot;Brady,&quot; &quot;grave,&quot; &quot;gaseous,&quot; &quot;gastronome,&quot; &quot;gracious,&quot; and I finally abandoned the attempt, simply saying to myself that it began with a &quot;G,&quot; and there was an &quot;a&quot; sound after it. The next morning when thinking of something entirely different, this name &quot;Grady&quot; came up in my mind with as much distinctness as though someone had whispered it in my ear. This remembering was done without any conscious effort on my part, and was evidently the result of the exertion made the day before when the mnemonic processes were put to work. Every reader must have had a similar experience which he can recall, and which will fall in line with the examples given.</p><p>It follows, then, that when we endeavor, without the aid of any system, to recall a forgotten fact or name, our memory presents to us words of similar sound or meaning in its journey toward the goal to which we have started it. This goes to show that our ideas are arranged in groups in whatever secret cavity or recess of the brain they occupy, and that the arrangement is not an alphabetical one exactly, and not entirely by meaning, but after some fashion partaking of both.</p><p>If you are looking for the word &quot;meadow&quot; you may reach &quot;middle&quot; before you come to it, or &quot;Mexico,&quot; or many, words beginning with the &quot;m&quot; sound, or containing the &quot;dow&quot;, as window, or &quot;dough,&quot; or you may get &quot;field&quot; or &quot;farm&quot;--but you are on the right track, and if you do not interfere with your intellectual process you will finally come to the idea which you are seeking.</p><p>How often have you heard people say, &quot;I forget his name, it is something like Beadle or Beagle--at any rate it begins with a B.&quot; Each and all of these were unconscious Loisettians, and they were practicing blindly, and without proper method or direction, the excellent system which he teaches. The thing, then, to do--and it is the final and simple truth which Loisette teaches--is to travel over this ground in the other direction--to cement the fact which you wish to remember to some other fact or word which you know will be brought out by the implied conditions--and thus you will always be able to travel from your given starting-point to the thing which you wish to call to mind.</p><p>It seems as though a channel were cut in our mind-stuff along which the memory flows. How to construct an easy channel for any event or series of events or facts which one wishes to remember, along which the mind will ever afterward travel, is the secret of mnemonics.</p><p>Loisette, in common with all the mnemonic teachers, uses the old device of representing numbers by letters--and as this is the first and easiest step in the art, this seems to be the most logical place to introduce the accepted equivalents of the Arabic numerals:</p><p>0 is always represented by s, z or c soft.</p><p>1 is always represented by t, th or d.</p><p>2 is always represented by n.</p><p>3 is always represented by m.</p><p>4 is always represented by r.</p><p>5 is always represented by l.</p><p>6 is always represented by sh, j, ch soft or g soft.</p><p>7 is always represented by g hard, k, c hard, q or final ng.</p><p>8 is always represented by f or v.</p><p>9 is always represented by p or b.</p><p>All the other letters are used simply to fill up. Double letters in a word count only as one. In fact, the system goes by sound, not by spelling, For instance, &quot;this&quot; or &quot;dizzy&quot; would stand for ten; &quot;catch&quot; or &quot;gush&quot; would stand for 76, and the only difficulty is to make some word or phrase which will contain only the significant letters in the proper order, filled out with non-significants into some guise of meaning or intelligibility.</p><p>You can remember the equivalents given above by noting that z is the first letter of &quot;zero,&quot; and c of &quot;cipher,&quot; t has but one stroke, n has two, m three; the script f is very like 8; the script p like 9; r is the last letter of &quot;four;&quot; l is the Roman numeral for 50, which suggests 5. The others may be retained by memorizing these nonsense lines:</p><p>Six shy Jewesses chase George. Seven great kings came quarreling.</p><p>Suppose you wished to get some phrase or word that would express the number 3,685, you arrange the letters this way:</p><pre><code>3   ..   6   ..   8   ..   5
</code></pre><p>a m a sh a f a 1 e e j e v e i i ch i i o o g o o u u u u h h h h w w w w x x x x y y y y</p><p>You can make out &quot;image of law,&quot; &quot;my shuffle,&quot; &quot;matchville,&quot; etc., etc., as far as you like to work it out.</p><p>Now, suppose you wished to memorize the fact that $1,000,000 in gold weighs 3,685 pounds, you go about it in this way, and here is the kernel and crux of Loisette&#39;s system: &quot;How much does $1,000,000 in gold weigh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Weigh-scales.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Scales--statue of justice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Statue of Justice--image of law.&quot;</p><p>The process is simplicity itself. The thing you wish to recall, and that you fear to forget, is the weight; consequently you cement your chain of suggestion to the idea which is most prominent in your mental question. What do you weigh with? Scales. What does the mental picture of scales suggest? The statue of Justice, blindfolded and weighing out award and punishment to man. Finally, what is this statue of Justice but the image of law? And the words &quot;image of law,&quot; translated back from the significant letters m, g soft, f and 1, give you 3--6--8--5, the number of pounds in $1,000,000 in gold. You bind together in your mind each separate step in the journey, the one suggests the other, and you will find a year from now that the fact will be as fresh in your memory as it is today. You cannot lose it. It is chained to you by an unbreakable mnemonic tie. Mark that it is not claimed that &quot;weight&quot; will of itself suggest &quot;scales,&quot; and &quot;scales&quot; &quot;statue of Justice,&quot; etc., but that, having once passed your attention up and down that ladder of ideas, your mental tendency will be to take the same route, and get to the same goal again and again. Indeed, beginning with the weight of $1,000,000, &quot;image of law&quot; will turn up in your mind without your consciousness of any intermediate station on the way, after some iteration and reiteration of the original chain.</p><p>Again, so as to fasten the process in the reader&#39;s mind even more firmly, suppose that it were desired to fix the date of the battle of Hastings (A. D. 1066) in the memory; 1066 may be represented by the words &quot;the wise judge&quot; (th--1, s--0, j--6, dg--6; the others are non-significants); a chain might be made thus:</p><p>Battle of Hastings--arbitrament of war.</p><p>Arbitrament of war--arbitration.</p><p>Arbitration--judgment.</p><p>Judgment--the wise judge.</p><p>Make mental pictures, connect ideas, repeat words and sounds, go about it any way you please, so that you will form a mental habit of connecting the &quot;battle of Hastings&quot; with the idea of &quot;arbitrament of war,&quot; and so on for the other links in the chain, and the work is done.</p><p>Loisette makes the beginning of his system unnecessarily difficult, to say nothing of his illogical arrangement in the grammar of the art of memory, which he makes the first of his lessons. He analyzes suggestion into--</p><ol><li><p>Inclusion.</p></li><li><p>Exclusion.</p></li><li><p>Concurrence.</p></li></ol><p>All of which looks very scientific and orderly, but is really misleading and badly named. The truth is that one idea will suggest another:</p><ol><li><p>By likeness or opposition of meaning, as &quot;house&quot; suggests &quot;room&quot; or &quot;door,&quot; etc.; or, &quot;white&quot; suggests &quot;black&quot;; &quot;cruel,&quot; &quot;kind,&quot; etc.</p></li><li><p>By likeness of sound, as &quot;harrow&quot; and &quot;barrow&quot;; &quot;Henry&quot; and &quot;Hennepin.&quot;</p></li><li><p>By mental juxtaposition, a peculiarity different in each person, and depending upon each one&#39;s own experiences. Thus, &quot;St. Charles&quot; suggests &quot;railway bridge&quot; to me, because I was vividly impressed by the breaking of the Wabash bridge at that point. &quot;Stable&quot; and &quot;broken leg&quot; come near each other in my experience, as do &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;shot-gun&quot; and &quot;licking.&quot;</p></li></ol><p>Out of these three sorts of suggestion it is possible to get from anyone fact to another in a chain certain and safe, along which the mind may be depended upon afterwards always to follow.</p><p>The chain is, of course, by no means all. Its making and its binding must be accompanied by a vivid, methodically directed attention, which turns all the mental light gettable in a focus upon the subject passing across the mind&#39;s screen. Before Loisette was thought of this was known. In the old times in England, in order to impress upon the mind of the rising generation the parish boundaries in the rural districts, the boys were taken to each of the landmarks in succession, the position and bearing of each pointed out carefully, and, in order to deepen the impression, the young people were then and there vigorously thrashed--a mechanical method of attracting the attention which was said never to have failed. This system has had its supporters in many of the old-fashioned schools, and there are men who will read these lines who can recall, with an itching sense of vivid impression, the 144 lickings which were said to go with the multiplication table.</p><p>In default of a thrashing, however, the student must cultivate as best he can an intense fixity of perception upon every fact or word or date that he wishes to make permanently his own. It is easy. It is a matter of habit. If you will, you can photograph an idea upon your cerebral gelatine so that neither years nor events will blot it out or overlay it. You must be clearly and distinctly aware of the thing you are putting into your mental treasure-house, and drastically certain of the cord by which you have tied it to some other thing of which you are sure. Unless it is worth your while to do this, you might as well abandon any hope of mnemonic improvement, which will not come without the hardest kind of hard work, although it is work that will grow constantly easier with practice and reiteration. You need, then:</p><ol><li><p>Methodic suggestion.</p></li><li><p>Methodic attention.</p></li><li><p>Methodic reiteration.</p></li></ol><p>And this is all there is to Loisette, and a great deal it is. Two of them will not do without the third. You do not know how many steps there are from your hall door to your bedroom, though you have attended to and often reiterated the journey. But if there are twenty of them, and you have once bound the word &quot;nice,&quot; or &quot;nose,&quot; or &quot;news&quot; or &quot;hyenas,&quot; to the fact of the stairway, you can never forget it.</p><p>The Professor makes a point, and very wisely, of the importance of working through some established chain, so that the whole may be carried away in the mind--not alone for the value of the facts so bound together, but for the mental discipline so afforded.</p><p>Here, then, is the &quot;President Series,&quot; which contains the name and date of inauguration of each President from Washington to Cleveland. The manner in which it is to be mastered is this: Beginning at the top, try to find in your mind some connection between each word and the one following it. See how you can at some future time make one suggest the next, either by suggestion of sound or sense, or by mental juxtaposition. When you have found this dwell on it attentively for a moment or two. Pass it backward and forward before you, and then go on to the next step.</p><p>The chain runs thus, the names of the President being in capitals, the date words or date phrases being inclosed in parentheses:</p><p>President Chosen for the first word as the one most apt to occur to the mind of anyone wishing to repeat the names of the Presidents.</p><p>Dentist President and dentist.</p><p>Draw What does a dentist do?</p><p>(To give up) When something is drawn from one it is given up.

If the reader has learned the series so that he can say it down from President to Taft, he can with no effort, and without any further preparation, say it backwards from Taft up to the commencement!

If it is a book that is to be learned as one would prepare for an examination, each chapter is to be considered separately. Of each an epitome is to be written in which the writer must exercise all of his ingenuity to reduce the matter in hand to its final skeleton of fact. This he is to commit to memory both by the use of the chain and the old system of interrogation. Suppose after much labor through a wide space of language one boils a chapter or an event down to the final irreducible sediment: &quot;Magna Charta was exacted by the barons from King John at Runnymede.&quot;</p><p>You must now turn this statement this way and that way; asking yourself about it every possible and impossible question, gravely considering the answers, and, if you find any part of it especially difficult to remember, chaining it to the question which will bring it out. Thus, &quot;What was exacted by the barons from King John at Runnymede?&quot; &quot;Magna Charta.&quot; &quot;By whom was Magna Charta exacted from King John at Runnymede?&quot; &quot;By the barons.&quot; &quot;From whom was,&quot; etc., etc.? &quot;King John.&quot; &quot;From what king,&quot; etc., etc.? &quot;King John.&quot; &quot;Where was Magna Charta,&quot; etc., etc.? &quot;At Runnymede.&quot;</p><p>And so on and so on, as long as your ingenuity can suggest questions to ask, or points of view from which to consider the statement. Your mind will be finally saturated with the information, and prepared to spill it out at the first squeeze of the examiner. This, however, is not new. It was taught in the schools hundreds of years before Loisette was born. Old newspaper men will recall in connection with it Horace Greeley&#39;s statement that the test of a news item was the clear and satisfactory manner in which a report answered the interrogatories, &quot;What?&quot; &quot;When?&quot; &quot;Where?&quot; &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>In the same way Loisette advises the learning of poetry, e. g.:</p><p>&quot;The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who came down?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How did the Assyian come down?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like what animal did?&quot; etc.</p><p>And so on and so on, until the verses are exhausted of every scrap of information to be had out of them by the most assiduous cross-examination.</p><p>Whatever the reader may think of the availability or value of this part of the system, there are so many easily applicable tests of the worth of much that Loisette has done, that it may be taken with the rest.</p><p>Few people, to give an easy example, can remember the value of the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of the circle beyond four places of decimals, or at most six--3.141592. Here is the value to 108 decimal places:</p><p>3.14159265.3589793238.4626433832.7950288419.7169399375.1058209749.- 4459230781.6406286208.9986280348.2534211706.7982148086 plus.</p><p>By a very simple application of the numerical letter values these 108 decimal places can be carried in the mind and recalled about as fast as you can write them down. All that is to be done is to memorize these nonsense lines:</p><p>Mother Day will buy any shawl. My love pick up my new muff. A Russian jeer may move a woman. Cables enough for Utopia. Get a cheap ham pie by my cooley. The slave knows a bigger ape. I rarely hop on my sick foot. Cheer a sage in a fashion safe. A baby fish now views my wharf. Annually Mary Ann did kiss a jay, A cabby found a rough savage.</p><p>Now translate each significant into its proper value and you have the task accomplished. &quot;Mother Day,&quot; m--3, th--l, r--4, d--l, and so on. Learn the lines one at a time by the method of interrogatories. &quot;Who will buy any shawl?&quot; &quot;Which Mrs. Day will buy a shawl?&quot; &quot;Is Mother Day particular about the sort of shawl she will buy?&quot; &quot;Has she bought a shawl?&quot; etc., etc. Then cement the end of each line to the beginning of the next one, thus, &quot;Shawl&quot;--&quot;warm garment&quot;--&quot;warmth&quot;--&quot;love&quot;--&quot;my love,&quot; and go on as before. Stupid as the work may seem to you, you can memorize the figures in fifteen minutes this way so that you will not forget them in fifteen years. Similarly you can take Haydn&#39;s Dictionary of Dates and turn fact after fact into nonsense lines like these which you cannot lose.</p><p>And this ought to be enough to show anybody the whole art. If you look back across the sands of time and find out that it is that ridiculous old &quot;Thirty days hath September&quot; which comes to you when you are trying to think of the length of October--if you can quote your old prosody,</p><p>&quot;O datur ambiguis,&quot; etc.,</p><p>with much more certainty than you can serve up your Horace; if, in fine, jingles and alliterations, wise and otherwise, have stayed with you, while solid and serviceable information has faded away, you may be certain that here is the key to the enigma of memory.</p><p>You can apply it yourself in a hundred ways.

They are, in idea, the same as the more familiar lines:</p><p>Monday&#39;s child is fair of face, Tuesday&#39;s child is full of grace; Wednesday&#39;s child is merry and glad, Thursday&#39;s child is sorry and sad; Friday&#39;s child is loving and giving; Saturday&#39;s child must work for its living; While the child that is born on the Sabbath day Is blithe and bonny and good and gay.</p><p>Short Grammar.</p><p>Three little words you often see Are Articles, a, an, and the.

Instead of Nouns the Pronouns stand-- His head, her face, your arm, my hand. Verbs tell something to be done-- To read, count, laugh, sing, jump or run. How things are done the Adverbs tell-- As slowly, quickly, ill or well. Conjunctions join the words together-- As men and women, wind or weather. The Preposition stands before The noun, as in or through the door. The Interjection shows surprise-- As Oh! how pretty, Ah! how wise.

Distances that Stun the Mind and Baffle Comprehension.</p><p>&quot;The stars,&quot; though appearing small to us because of their immense distance, are in reality great and shining suns. If we were to escape from the earth into space, the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and eventually the sun would become invisible. Mizar, the middle star in the tail of the Great Bear, is forty times as heavy as the sun. To the naked eye there are five or six thousand of these heavenly bodies visible.</p><p>Cygni is the nearest star to us in this part of the sky. Alpha Centauri, in the constellation of Centaur, in the Southern Hemisphere, is the nearest of all the stars. The sun is off 93,000,000 miles; multiply this by 200,000, and the result is, roughly speaking, 20,000,000,000,000; and this is the distance we are from Alpha Centauri. At the speed of an electric current, 180,000 miles per second, a message to be sent from a point on the earth&#39;s surface would go seven times around the earth in one second. Let it be supposed that messages were sent off to the different heavenly bodies. To reach the moon at this rate it would take about one second. In eight minutes a message would get to the sun, and allowing for a couple of minutes&#39; delay, one could send a message to the sun and get an answer all within twenty minutes. But to reach Alpha Centauri it would take three years; and as this is the nearest of the stars, what time must it take to get to the others? If, when Wellington won the battle of Waterloo, in 1815, the news had been telegraphed off immediately, there are some stars so remote that it would not yet have reached them. To go a step further, if in 1066 the result of the Norman Conquest had been wired to some of these stars, the message would still be on its way.</p><p>SENATOR VEST&#39;S EULOGY ON THE DOG.</p><p>&quot;Gentlemen of the Jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son and daughter that he has reared with loving care may become ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has he may lose. It flies away from him when he may need it most. Man&#39;s reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees and do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our head. The one absolutely unselfish friend a man may have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous, is the dog.</p><p>&quot;Gentlemen of the jury, A man&#39;s dog stands by him in prosperity and poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, when the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master&#39;s side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince.</p><p>&quot;When all other friends desert, he remains, when riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens. If fortune drives the master forth an outcast into the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes and death takes his master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws and his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.&quot;</p><p>HEALTH AND BEAUTY</p><p>WOULD YOU BE BEAUTIFUL?</p><p>In womanly beauty the excellences expected and looked for are faultless symmetry of form and feature and a complexion varying in hue as the mind is affected by internal emotion, but with an expression of purity, gentleness, sensibility, refinement and intelligence.</p><p>Moore, the poet, has given expression to his ideal of beauty in the following lines:</p><p>&quot;This was not the beauty--Oh, nothing like this, That to young Nourmahal gave such magic bliss; But that loveliness, ever in motion, which plays Like the light upon autumn&#39;s shadowy days.</p><p>&quot;Now here and now there, giving warmth as it flies From the lips to the cheek, from the cheek to the eyes; Now melting in mist, and now breaking in gleams Like the glimpses a saint has of heavenly dreams.&quot;</p><p>Wordsworth expressed himself in the following lines:</p><p>&quot;He was among the prime in worth, An object beauteous to behold; Well born, well bred; I sent him forth Ingenuous, innocent, and bold.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps you ask how you can attain beauty if you do not possess it; or, if you have some of its qualities, how you may get those you are lacking. If you will practice the following rules you will grow more and more beautiful in the eyes of others, even if age does bring gray hair and a wrinkled skin:</p><p>First.--Cleanliness is next to godliness. Practice it in every feature of your daily life.</p><p>Second.--Have some purpose to achieve and steadfastly work to attain it.</p><p>Third--Cultivate self-discipline; be master of your passions, under all circumstances.</p><p>Fourth.--Study to know the laws of life that yield harmony and good health and obey them. Look on the bright side of life always.</p><p>Fifth.--Avoid intemperance in all things.</p><p>Sixth.--Cultivate every mental and bodily quality that will make you firm in goodness, strong and physically able to be useful to your kind, generous and broad-minded, self-sacrificing, and you will daily and hourly be lovely and grow into the beautiful.</p><p>CARE OF THE SCALP AND HAIR.</p><p>Beautiful hair, beautiful skin and a beautiful form are the three graces which are the birthright of every woman, but which, through lack of good judgment and common sense, or through thoughtlessness on the part of mothers of growing children, comparatively few possess.</p><p>Beautiful hair is one of nature&#39;s greatest gifts, and yet we never seem to appreciate it until there is danger of losing it, or until it becomes faded and lusterless because we have not used the right means for preserving it.</p><p>The beauty and continuance of the hair depend upon its proper nourishment, gained by the circulation of blood through the scalp, and this must be maintained to keep the hair in good condition.</p><p>The structure of the hair is very beautiful, and each hair is contained in a delicate sheath which fits into a slight depression in the skin called the follicle, and around the base of the hair nature has provided glands to secrete oily matter, the purpose of which is to keep the hair glossy.</p><p>In early maturity the hair reaches the state of greatest beauty, and at this time the greatest care should be given it, feeding and nourishing it as we would a plant--giving it plenty of air and sunlight, carefully shampooing at least once in ten days. Massage the scalp to keep it loose and flexible. Use electricity, a good tonic, and occasionally singe the split ends.</p><p>If this process is commenced at the right time, the result will be fewer cases of baldness in men and thin, poor hair in women.</p><p>The hair should also be worn loosely, forming a soft frame for the face, which is always more becoming than tightly drawn hair. Many women drag their hair out by the roots by tying back too firmly.</p><p>CARE OF THE SKIN.</p><p>A beautiful skin is smooth, soft and clear; the color varies in different individuals. In perfect health it is moist and with the delicate shading of a flower--climate, hair and eyes, of course, determining the color, and the continued beauty of it depending upon pure blood, fresh air and sunlight, also perfect cleanliness and care.</p><p>The pores should always be kept free from obstruction and extremes of heat and cold avoided as much as possible. In health, the care of the skin is a simple matter, massage being a great factor, assisted always by the use of pure creams. A good cleansing cream is a great necessity, as it enters the pores and frees them from dirt, leaving the skin soft and pliable, in which condition it is ready to absorb the skin food when the finger massage is given, making it possible for the gentle electric current to force the ointment into the deeper layers of the skin, thus effecting the removal of moth patches, tan, freckles and other discolorations and imperfections. The vibratory massage should follow, the purpose of which is to stimulate the tissues, throwing off worn-out particles and increasing the circulation of the blood by giving proper exercise to the facial muscles, thereby restoring and preserving the color and contour, making the skin beautiful, clear, eradicating and preventing wrinkles.</p><p>The use of a pure face powder is absolutely necessary. Best results are obtained by using a blended powder, as the skin tint is thus assured.</p><p>TO DEVELOP THE BUST.</p><p>A beautiful bust is the desire and admiration of every woman. If nature has not been kind in this respect, any woman can develop a beautiful bust by exercise, bathing and gentle massage with a good bust ointment or skin food.</p><p>Electric massage is very beneficial, and if properly given, brings quick and sure results.</p><p>Swimming and deep breathing are great aids.</p><p>CARE OF THE HANDS.</p><p>A study of the hand is very interesting, and if mothers understood more of its beautiful construction many of the little accidents which result in deformed finger nails could be avoided. Mothers should attend most carefully to the early cultivation of their children&#39;s finger nails, as the habit of biting them is so easily formed and is sure to permanently destroy their beauty.</p><p>A perfect hand is rounded and plump, soft, white and dimpled, with tapering finger tips and filbert-shaped nails, snowing the little half-moon.</p><p>It is possible for any woman to have such a hand if she is willing to take time once a week to have the nails treated and to give them a little personal attention each day. Great care should be taken in washing the hands. A mild soap should be used, and particular attention paid to the thorough drying of them, after which a good cuticle cream should be applied and well rubbed in. The same cream may be used to loosen the cuticle at the base of the nail, when it can be gently pushed back, thus keeping the half-moon exposed. An orange-wood stick should always be used to clean the nails.</p><p>Massaging the hands at least once a month aids wonderfully in making them symmetrical and keeping the joints flexible and the skin free from dark spots and wrinkles.</p><p>INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT.</p><p>It is of prime importance in feeding an infant to do this at regular intervals, since during the first three months of its life the feeding habits of the child should be established, and if care be used in this regard the child will wake of its own accord at the proper time. The last meal at night should be at 11 p. m., and if the child is healthy and will sleep it need not be fed until 3 to 5 a. m. the following morning. In both breast and artificial feeding the above applies, and the same method should be employed; namely, the child should be held in the arms during the meal, which should last from ten to fifteen minutes.</p><p>Both in breast and artificial feeding it is possible to overfeed the child. Many infants are systematically overfed. The young mother should understand how small an infant&#39;s stomach is. At birth it will hold a little more than an ounce of fluid, or two tablespoonfuls, and at the end of two months only three ounces. If, therefore, the mother persists in trying to give the child four ounces of food, the child will suffer from an excess. Many children during the first few mouths of life bring up their food, and the mother fears that there is some inherited tendency to weak digestion. It is wrong to feed a child simply because it cries, as very frequently it is not a cry of hunger, but one caused by indigestion from overfeeding.</p><p>If the child is being fed with the bottle it is important that the food be given at a temperature of 100 deg. F., or as nearly that as possible; never over; and if the child be fed out of doors in its carriage it is well to have a flannel bag of some kind to slip over the bottle to keep it at the same temperature until the meal is finished. Many cases of colic are caused by inattention to this point.</p><p>It is a common mistake that when a child cries it needs additional food. There are many cases where a little drink of water is the prime need of the child, and great care should be taken that this is heated to the proper temperature, and especially that no water be given to the child except that which has been boiled. A few teaspoonfuls should be given to the child, therefore, several times a day, but aside from that he should have nothing but his regular food until he is at least a year old. For the same reason, therefore, if a child be fed by the bottle, the water used in preparing the food should have been previously boiled, and care should be exercised not to expose the food to the air during or after its preparation. It should be remembered that the food of a child must be nutritious, and that in this food, especially when at the proper temperature for the infant, bacteria from the air will flourish wonderfully fast, and therefore the food should not be exposed to possible contamination.</p><p>It is of very great importance that the feeding-bottles be always clean and sweet. It is an advantage to have several bottles on hand, and also two or three brushes for cleaning. Keep a special vessel, with water in which there is a little bicarbonate of soda, so that the moment the bottle is used it may be thoroughly washed and kept in the water. Do not use a nipple with a rubber tube, but the short, black rubber nipples, which fit over the mouth of the bottle. Do not enlarge the hole in the nipple, so as to make it too easy for the baby to draw its food, otherwise the food being taken so rapidly into the stomach will often cause pain or vomiting. In washing the nipples turn them inside out and see that they are as thoroughly cleaned as possible, and keep them for use in a bottle filled with boiled water with a pinch of boric acid added.</p><p>The First Nursing.</p><p>It is very important that the child should be put to the breast immediately after it is washed. This is very necessary, both for the mother and the child, and prevents subsequent troubles. The fluid contained in the breast is at this stage called colostrum, and is intended by Nature to act upon the child as a laxative. This first nursing stimulates the secretion of the milk and causes uterine contraction, which is very much needed at this time. It is well to wash the infant&#39;s mouth out with sterilized water every time it feeds. For this purpose use clean water which has been boiled and allowed to cool, or a solution of boric acid in boiled water--5 grains to the ounce of water.</p><p>Infants, as a rule, should be bathed once a day, but never immediately after being nursed or fed. In very warm weather a child may be sponged in the evening as well as in the morning. The water for the bath of a young baby should be warm, and the temperature can be judged by testing it with the elbow, which is more sensitive than the hand. Lay a small blanket on the lap, cover the child with a flannel and sponge it under the clothes. This prevents it from taking cold from exposure, The room should not be cooler than 68 deg. F., and the door must be kept closed to avoid drafts. Use only pure white soap, and a soft cloth is better than a sponge. The body should be carefully dried and lightly powdered to absorb any moisture that may remain.</p><p>THE NAMES OF THE MONTHS.</p><p>THE DERIVATIONS OF THE NAMES OF THE MONTHS.</p><p>January.--The Roman god Janus presided over the beginning of everything; hence the first month of the year was called after him.</p><p>February.--The Roman festival Februs was held on the 15th day of this month, in honor of Lupercus, the god of fertility.</p><p>March--Named from the Roman god of war, Mars.</p><p>April.--Latin, Aprilis, probably derived from aperire, to open; because spring generally begins, and the buds open in this month.</p><p>May.--Lat. Maius, probably derived from Maia, a feminine divinity worshiped at Rome on the first day of this month.</p><p>June.--Juno, a Roman divinity worshiped as the Queen of Heaven.</p><p>July (Julius)--Julius Caesar was born in this month.</p><p>August.--Named by the Emperor Augustus Caesar, B. C. 30, after himself, as he regarded it as a fortunate month, being that in which he had gained several victories.</p><p>September (septem, or 7).--September was the seventh month in the old Roman calendar.</p><p>October (octo, or 8).--Eighth month of the old Roman year.</p><p>November (novem, or 9).-November was the ninth month in the old Roman year.</p><p>December (decem, or 10).--December was the tenth month of the early Roman year. About the 21st of this month the sun enters the Tropic of Capricorn, and forms the winter solstice.</p><p>DAYS OF THE WEEK.</p><p>Sunday, (Saxon) Sunnandaed, day of the sun,</p><p>Monday, (German) Montag, day or the moon.</p><p>Tuesday, (Anglo-Saxon) Tiwesdaeg, from Tiw, the god of war.</p><p>Wednesday, (Anglo-Saxon) Wodnesdaeg, from Odin, the god of storms.</p><p>Thursday, (Danish) Thor, the god of thunder.</p><p>Friday, (Saxon) Frigedaeg, day of Freya, goddess of marriage.</p><p>Saturday, the day of Saturn, the god of time.</p><p>The names of the seven days of the week originated with the Egyptian astronomers. They gave them the names of the sun, moon, and five planets, viz.: Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn.</p><p>WHAT HOUSEKEEPERS SHOULD REMEMBER.</p><p>That cold rain water and soap will remove machine grease from washable fabrics.</p><p>That fish may be scaled much easier by first dipping them into boiling water for a minute.</p><p>That fresh meat beginning to sour will sweeten if placed outdoors in the cool air over night.</p><p>That milk which has changed may be sweetened or rendered fit for use again by stirring in a little soda.</p><p>That a tablespoonful of turpentine boiled with your white clothes will greatly aid the whitening process.</p><p>That kerosene will soften boots and shoes that have been hardened by water and will render them as pliable as new.</p><p>That thoroughly wetting the hair once or twice with a solution of salt and water will keep it from falling out.</p><p>That salt fish are quickest and best freshened by soaking in sour milk.</p><p>That salt will curdle new milk; hence, in preparing porridge, gravies, etc., salt should not be added until the dish is prepared.</p><p>That one teaspoonful of ammonia to a teacup of water, applied with a rag, will clean silver or gold jewelry perfectly.</p><p>That paint stains that are dry and old may be removed from cotton and woolen goods with chloroform. It is a good plan to first cover the spot with olive oil or butter.</p><p>That clear boiling water will remove tea stains. Pour the water through the stain and thus prevent it spreading over the fabric.</p><p>That charcoal is recommended as an absorbent of gases in the milk-room where foul gases are present. It should be freshly powdered and kept there continually, especially in hot weather, when unwholesome odors are most liable to infect the milk.</p><p>That applying kerosene with a rag, when you are about to put your stoves away for the summer, will prevent them from rusting. Treat your farming implements in the same way before you lay them aside for the fall.</p><p>That a teaspoonful of borax, put in the last water in which clothes are rinsed, will whiten them surprisingly. Pound the borax so it will dissolve easily. This is especially good to remove the yellow that time gives to white garments that have been laid aside for two or three years.</p><p>That a good agency for keeping the air of the cellar sweet and wholesome is whitewash made of good white lime and water only. The addition of glue or size, or anything of that kind, only furnishes organic matter to speedily putrefy. The use of lime in whitewash is not only to give a white color, but it greatly promotes the complete oxidation of effluvia in the cellar air. Any vapors that contain combined nitrogen in the unoxidized form contribute powerfully to the development of disease germs.</p><p>CHARACTER AS SEEN IN FACES.</p><p>Thick lips indicate genius and conservatism. Large dilating nostrils are a sign of poetic temperament and a sensitive nature. A long forehead denotes liberality. Arched eyebrows, good ancestry and amiability. A bold, projecting Roman nose indicates enterprise. Delicate nose, good nature. A large nose, strength of will and character. An eye that looks one cheerfully and frankly in the face shows honesty and faithfulness. Lips slightly curved upward at the ends indicate a fine sense of humor. Soft round cheeks denote gentleness and affection; dimples in the cheeks, roguery; in the chin, one who falls easily in love. A broad chin denotes firmness. Straight lips, firmly closed, resolution. Large ears denote generosity.</p><p>BELL TIME ON SHIPBOARD.</p><p>Time on shipboard is divided into periods of four hours--from midnight to midnight--and the lapse of every half hour is marked by one or more strokes of the bell--from one stroke for the end of the first half hour to eight strokes or, in nautical language, eight bells, for the end of the fourth hour. Thus 12:30 a. m. is 1 bell; 1:00 a. m., 2 bells; 1:30 a. m., 3 bells; 2:00 a. m., 4 bells; 2:30 a. m., 5 bells; 3:00 a. m., 6 bells; 3:30 a. m., 7 bells; 4:00 a. m., 8 bells. Then 4:30 a. m. is indicated by 1 bell; 5:00 a. m., 2 bells, etc.; 8 bells being sounded at 8:00 a. m., 12:00 m., 4:00 p. m., 8:00 p. m. and 12:00 p. m.</p><p>Four to 8:00 p. m. is divided into two &quot;dog watches&quot; called &quot;first dog watch&quot; and &quot;last dog watch,&quot; so as to change the watches daily; otherwise starboard or port watch would be on deck the same hours day after day.</p><p>QUEER ANALOGIES IN NATURE.</p><p>The cocoanut is, in many respects, like the human skull, although it closely resembles the skull of the monkey. A sponge may be so held as to remind one of the unfleshed face of the skeleton, and the meat of an English walnut is almost the exact representation of the brain. Plums and black cherries resemble the human eyes; almonds, and some other nuts, resemble the different varieties of the human nose, and an opened oyster and its shell are a perfect image of the human ear. The shape of almost any man&#39;s body may be found in the various kinds of mammoth pumpkins. The open hand may be discerned in the form assumed by scrub-willows and growing celery. The German turnip and the eggplant resemble the human heart. There are other striking resemblances between human organs and certain vegetable forms, The forms of many mechanical contrivances in common use may be traced back to the patterns furnished by nature. Thus, the hog suggested the plow; the butterfly, the ordinary hinge; the toadstool, the umbrella; the duck, the ship; the fungous growth on trees, the bracket. Anyone desirous of proving the oneness of the earthly system will find the resemblances in nature a most amusing study.--Scientific American.</p><p>MODERN FABLES.</p><p>Luxury.</p><p>Of two cats, one, thinking to be very fine, hunted only humming birds, and the other hunted only mice. The first had to hunt much longer than the other, because humming birds were scarce, so that it spent nearly all its life in getting food, while the other had little trouble to get all it wanted. &quot;How unfortunate it is,&quot; said the first cat, &quot;that I have formed my liking for what is so hard to get and is so little when I have it.&quot;</p><p>Fastidiousness.</p><p>A fastidious ox would not drink while standing in the water with his head turned down stream lest he should soil the water with his feet. But once when drinking with his head turned up stream he saw a whole drove of hogs washing in the water above him.</p><p>Attracting Attention.</p><p>A flea, which saw many people trying to get the attention of a king and waiting long for that purpose, said: &quot;Though I am but a little thing, I will get his attention.&quot; So he jumped up the throne until he got on the king&#39;s head. Here he received recognition from the king by a slap, and when he boasted to a dog of his success, the latter said: &quot;Some get attention by their merit, others by their demerit. In making yourself a nuisance you get recognition before the lords of the realm, but only as a flea.&quot;</p><p>Gambling.</p><p>A monkey playing with a steel trap got his tail cut off. He went back the next day to get his tail, when he got his foot cut off. &quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;I will go back and get both my foot and my tail.&quot; He went back, and the third time he got his head cut off, which ended his monkeying with the trap.</p><p>Mugwumpery.</p><p>A mule on one side of a fence was discontented because he was not on the other side. He finally jumped over, when he was equally discontented because he was not back again. &quot;Which side of the fence do you want to be on?&quot; asked a horse. &quot;It does not matter,&quot; replied the mule, &quot;provided I am on the other side.&quot;</p><p>The Non-Partisan.</p><p>A dog, running about in an irregular way, was asked where he was going. &quot;I am not going anywhere,&quot; replied the dog, &quot;but only running about to learn where to go.&quot;</p><p>Partisanship.</p><p>The swans, wishing to drive the peacocks from a park, procured a law against big feet. The peacocks retaliated by getting a counter law against big necks. Soon one side could see nothing but ugly feet, and the other nothing but long necks. At last they came to think peacocks were all feet and swans all neck.</p><p>NUMBER OF MILES BY WATER FROM NEW YORK.</p><p>To Amsterdam, 3,510; Bermudas, 660; Bombay, 11,574; Boston, 310; Buenos Ayres, 7,110; Calcutta, 12,425; Canton, 13,900; Cape Horn, 8,115; Cape of Good Hope, 6,830; Charleston, 750; Columbia River, 15,965; Constantinople, 5,140; Dublin, 3,225; Gibraltar, 3,300; Halifax, 612; Hamburg, 3,775; Havana, 1,420; Havre, 3,210; Kingston, 1,640; Lima, 11,310; Liverpool, 3,210; London, 3,375; Madras, 11,850; Naples, 4,330; New Orleans, 2,045; Panama, 2,358; Pekin, 15,325; Philadelphia, 240; Quebec, 1,400; Rio Janeiro, 3,840; Sandwich Islands, 15,300; San Francisco, 15,858; St. Petersburg, 4,420; Valparaiso, 9,750; Washington, 400; around the Globe, 25,000.</p><p>BUSINESS LAW IN BRIEF</p><p>It is a fraud to conceal a fraud.</p><p>Ignorance of the law excuses no one.</p><p>A contract made on a Sunday is void.</p><p>A contract made with a lunatic is void.</p><p>The act of one partner binds all the others.</p><p>An agreement without consideration is void.</p><p>The law compels no one to do impossibilities.</p><p>Agents are liable to their principals for errors.</p><p>Principals are liable for the acts of their agents.</p><p>A receipt for money paid is not legally conclusive.</p><p>Signatures made with a lead pencil are good in law.</p><p>The seal of a party to a written contract imports consideration.</p><p>A contract made with a minor cannot be enforced against him. A note made by a minor is voidable.</p><p>Each individual in a partnership is liable for the whole amount of the debts of the firm.</p><p>A note which does not state on its face that it bears interest, will bear interest only after due.</p><p>A lease of land for a longer term than one year is void unless in writing.</p><p>An indorser of a note is exempt from liability if notice of its dishonor is not mailed or served within twenty-four hours of its non-payment.</p><p>In case of the death of the principal maker of a note, the holder is not required to notify a surety that the note is not paid, before the settlement of the maker&#39;s estate. Notes obtained by fraud, or made by an intoxicated person, are not collectible.</p><p>If no time of payment is specified in a note it is payable on demand.</p><p>An indorser can avoid liability by writing &quot;without recourse&quot; beneath his signature.</p><p>A check indorsed by the payee is evidence of payment in the drawer&#39;s hands.</p><p>An outlawed debt is revived should the debtor make a partial payment.</p><p>If negotiable paper, pledged to a bank as security for the payment of a loan or debt, falls due, and the bank fails to demand payment and have it protested when dishonored, the bank is liable to the owner for the full amount of the paper.</p><p>Want of consideration--a common defense interposed to the payment of negotiable paper--is a good defense between the original parties to the paper; but after it has been transferred before maturity to an innocent holder for value it is not a defense.</p><p>Sometimes the holder of paper has the right to demand payment before maturity; for instance, when a draft has been protested for non-acceptance and the proper notices served, the holder may at once proceed against the drawer and indorsers.</p><p>Negotiable paper, payable to bearer or indorser in blank, which has been stolen or lost, cannot be collected by the thief or finder, but a holder who receives it in good faith before maturity, for value, can hold it against the owner&#39;s claims at the time it was lost.</p><p>If a note or draft is to be paid in the State where it is made, the contract will be governed by the laws of that State. When negotiable paper is payable in a State other than that in which it is made, the laws of that State will govern it. Marriage contracts, if valid where they are made, are valid everywhere. Contracts relating to personal property are governed by the laws of the place where made, except those relating to real estate, which are governed by the laws of the place where the land is situated.</p><p>THE RIGHT OF DOWER.</p><p>Dower is one-third of the husband&#39;s estate, and in general cannot be destroyed by the mere act of the husband. Hence, in the sale of real estate by the husband, his wife must, with the husband, sign the conveyance to make the title complete to the purchaser. In the absence of such signature, the widow can claim full dower rights after the husband&#39;s death. Creditors, also, seize the property subject to such dower rights.</p><p>The husband in his will sometimes gives his wife property in lieu of dowry. In this case, she may, after his death, elect to take either such property or her dower; but she cannot take both. While the husband lives the wife&#39;s right of dower in only inchoate; it cannot be enforced. Should he sell the land to a stranger, she has no right of action or remedy until his death.</p><p>In all cases the law of the State in which the land is situated governs it, and, as in the case of heirship, full information must be sought for in statute which is applicable.</p><p>MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.</p><p>Marriage may be entered into by any two persons, with the following exceptions: Idiots, lunatics, persons of unsound mind, persons related by blood or affinity within certain degrees prohibited by law, infants under the age of consent, which varies in the different States, and all persons already married and not legally divorced.</p><p>The causes for which a divorce may be obtained vary greatly in the different States. In South Carolina only fraud and force are recognized as invalidating the marriage tie, this State having no divorce law. In the District of Columbia and all the other States with the exception of Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Virginia, cruelty is a statutory cause, and desertion in all but New York. In most of the States neglect is also recognized as a valid cause. Imprisonment for crime is a cause in all except Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Physical inability is a cause in all the States except California, Connecticut, Idaho, North Dakota and Texas. Intemperance, in all but Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakotah, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. The time of residence required to secure a divorce varies from 6 months in Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada and Texas to 3 to 5 years in Massachusetts. In most States it is one year. Remarriage is permitted in all the States having divorce laws except Georgia, and alimony is also provided for in all these States.</p><p>RIGHTS OF MARRIED WOMEN.</p><p>Any and all property which a woman owns at her marriage, together with rents, issues and profits thereof, and the property which comes to her by descent, devise, bequest, gift or grant, or which she acquires by her trade, business, labor, or services performed on her separate account, shall, notwithstanding her marriage, remain her sole and separate property, and may be used, collected and invested by her in her own name, and shall not be subject to the interference or control of her husband, or be liable for his debts, unless for such debts as may have been contracted for the support of herself or children by her as his agent.</p><p>A married woman may likewise bargain, sell, assign, transfer and convey such property, and enter into contracts regarding the same on her separate trade, labor or business with the like effect as if she were unmarried. Her husband, however, is not liable for such contracts, and they do not render him or his property in any way liable therefor. She may also sue and be sued in all matters having relation to her sale and separate property in the same manner as if she were sole.</p><p>In the following cases a married woman&#39;s contract may be enforced against her and her separate estate: 1. When the contract is created in or respecting the carrying on of the trade or business of the wife. 2. When it relates to or is made for the sole benefit of her sole or separate estate. 3. When the intention to charge the separate estate is expressed in the contract creating the liability.</p><p>When a husband receives a principal sum of money belonging to his wife, the law presumes he receives it for her use, and he must account for it, or expend it on her account by her authority or direction, or that she gave it to him as a gift. If he receives interest or income and spends it with her knowledge and without objection, a gift will be presumed from acquiescence.</p><p>Money received by a husband from his wife and expended by him, under her direction, on his land, in improving the home of the family, is a gift, and cannot be recovered by the wife, or reclaimed, or an account demanded.</p><p>An appropriation by a wife, herself, of her separate property to the use and benefit of her husband, in the absence of all agreement to repay, or any circumstances from which such an agreement can be inferred, will not create the relation of debtor and creditor, nor render the husband liable to account.</p><p>Though no words of gift be spoken, a gift by a wife to her husband may be shown by the very nature of the transaction, or appear from the attending circumstances.</p><p>A wife who causelessly deserts her husband is not entitled to the aid of a court of equity in getting possession of such chattels as she has contributed to the furnishing and adornment of her husband&#39;s house. Her legal title remains, and she could convey her interest to a third party by sale, and said party would have a good title, unless her husband should prove a gift.</p><p>Wife&#39;s property is not liable to a lien of a sub-contractor for materials furnished to the husband for the erection of a building thereon, where it is not shown that the wife was notified of the intention to furnish the materials, or a settlement made with the contractor and given to the wife, her agent or trustee.</p><p>The common law of the United States has some curious provisions regarding the rights of married women, though in all the States there are statutory provisions essentially modifying this law. As it now stands the husband is responsible for necessaries supplied to the wife even should he not fail to supply them himself, and is held liable if he turn her from his house, or otherwise separates himself from her without good cause. He is not held liable if the wife deserts him, or if he turns her away for good cause. If she leaves him through good cause, then he is liable. If a man lives with a woman as his wife, and so represents her, even though this representation is made to one who knows she is not, he is liable the same way as if she were his wife.</p><p>THE LAW OF FINDING.</p><p>The general rule is that the finder has a clear title against every one but the owner. The proprietor of a hotel or a shop has no right to demand property of others found on his premises. Such proprietors may make regulations in regard to lost property which will bind their employes, but they cannot bind the public. The finder has been held to stand in the place of the owner, so that he was permitted to prevail in all action against a person who found an article which the plaintiff had originally found, but subsequently lost. The police have no special rights in regard to articles lost, unless those rights are conferred by statute. Receivers of articles found are trustees for the owner or finder. They have no power in the absence of special statute to keep an article against the finder, any more than the finder has to retain an article against the owner.</p><p>THE LAW OF COPYRIGHT.</p><p>The new copyright law, which went into effect July 1, 1909, differs in many respects from the law previously in force. Its main provisions are given below, but those desiring to avail themselves of its protection should write to the Register of Copyrights, Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., for full instructions and the necessary blanks. etc. The new law provides that the application for registration of any work &quot;shall specify to which of the following classes the work in which copyright is claimed belongs&quot;: (a) Books, including composite and cyclopedic works, directories, gazetteers, and other compilations; (b) periodicals, including newspapers; (c) lectures, sermons, addresses prepared for oral delivery: (d) dramatic or dramatico-musical compositions; (c) musical compositions; (f) maps; (g) works of art; models or designs for works of art; (h) reproductions of a work of art; (i) drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character: (j) photographs; (k) prints and pictorial illustrations.</p><p>Necessary Steps to Secure Copyright.</p><p>For works reproduced in copies for sale: 1. Publish the work with the copyright notice. The notice may be in the form &quot;Copyright, 19 ..... (year date of publication) by (name of copyright proprietor).&quot; 2. Promptly after publication, send to the Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., two copies of the best edition of the work, with an application for registration and a money order payable to the Register of Copyrights for the statutory registration fee of $l.</p><p>In the case of books by American authors, or permanent residents of the United States, the copies deposited must be accompanied by an affidavit, under the official seal of an officer authorized to administer oaths, stating that the typesetting, printing and binding of the book have been performed within the United States. Affidavit and application forms will be supplied on request.</p><p>Books of foreign origin in a language or languages other than English are not required to be manufactured in the United States. In the case of a book in the English language published abroad before publication in this country, an ad interim copyright for 30 days may be secured under certain conditions.</p><p>Copyright may also be had of certain classes of works (see a, b, c, below) of which copies are not reproduced for sale, by filing an application for registration, with the statutory fee of $1, sending therewith: (a) in the case of lectures or other oral addresses or of dramatic or musical compositions, one complete manuscript or typewritten copy of the work. Registration, however, does not exempt the copyright proprietor from the deposit of printed copies. (b) In the case of photographs not intended for general circulation, one photographic print. (c) In the case of works of art (paintings, drawings, sculpture), or of drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character, one photograph or other identifying reproduction of the work. In all these cases, if the work is later reproduced in copies for sale, such copies must be deposited.</p><p>Duration of Copyright.</p><p>The original term of copyright runs for twenty-eight years, and may be renewed under certain conditions for a further term of twenty-eight years, making fifty-six years in all.</p><p>Assignments.</p><p>Copyrights are assignable by any instrument of writing.</p><p>Every assignment of copyright must be recorded in the Copyright Office within three months after its execution in the United States or within six months after its execution without the limits of the United States.</p><p>LEGAL HOLIDAYS IN VARIOUS STATES.</p><p>Jan. 1, New Year&#39;s Day.

A male child born abroad of American parents has an equal chance to become President with one born on American soil.</p><p>CHAMOIS SKINS.</p><p>The animal from which the chamois skin derives its name inhabits the high mountains from the Pyrenees to the Caucasus. Chamois are most numerous in the Alps, where they dwell in small herds and feed on the herbage of the mountain sides. They are about the size of a small goat, dark chestnut-brown in color, with the exception of the forehead, the sides of the lower jaws and the muzzle, which are white. Its horns, rising above the eyes, are black, smooth and straight for two-thirds of their length, when they suddenly curve backward.</p><p>The chamois hunter, provided with a gun, a bag of provisions, an iron-shod staff to assist him in climbing and leaping, an ax to cut steps in the ice and shoes studded with iron points, traverses the mountains and follows his prey not only during the day, but also at night.</p><p>Nearly all the chamois skins now in the market are made from the skins of the lamb or sheep. This industry has been largely developed in England and France, and these countries have supplied the market of the United States almost exclusively until recent years, when the manufacture of these goods was commenced in the United States.</p><p>WHAT&#39;S IN A NAME?</p><p>ORIGIN AND MEANING OF NAMES OF MEN.</p><p>A Aaron, Hebrew, a mountain, or lofty.</p><p>Abel, Hebrew, vanity.</p><p>Abraham, Hebrew, the father of many.</p><p>Absalom, Hebrew, the father of peace.</p><p>Adam, Hebrew, red earth.</p><p>Adolphus, Saxon, happiness and help.</p><p>Adrian, Latin, one who helps.</p><p>Alan, Celtic, harmony; or Slavonic, a hound.</p><p>Albert, Saxon, all bright.</p><p>Alexander, Greek, a helper of men.</p><p>Alfred, Saxon, all peace.</p><p>Alonzo, form of Alphonso, q. v.</p><p>Alphonso.

The following compact lexicon is therefore both interesting and instructive:</p><p>Aeroplane--A generic term applied in common use to all classes of sustaining surfaces; strictly applicable only to flat surfaces.</p><p>Adjusting Surfaces--Commonly a comparatively small surface, usually at the end of a wing tip, used to adjust lateral balance; preferably restricted to surfaces capable of variable adjustment, but not of movement by controlling devices. See &quot;Stabilizer&#39;&quot; and &quot;Wing tip&quot; and compare &quot;Aileron.&quot;</p><p>Advancing Edge--The front edge of a sustaining or other surface.</p><p>Advancing Surface--A surface that precedes another through the air, as in a double monoplane.</p><p>Aerocurve--A proposed substitute for aeroplane.</p><p>Aerodrome--A substitute proposed by Langley for aeroplane. Strictly applicable to a course rather than to a vehicle.</p><p>Aileron (a&#39;ler-on)--A small hinged or separated wing tip or surface capable of independent manipulation for the purpose of maintaining lateral balance.</p><p>Aviation (a-vi-a&#39;shun)--Dynamic flight by means of heavier-than-air mechanisms.</p><p>Aviator (a&#39;vi-a-ter)--The operator or pilot of a heavier-than-air machine.</p><p>Aerofoil--Term used to indicate lifting surface,</p><p>Angle of Incidence--The angle which a line drawn from the leading to the trailing edge of the plane makes with the horizontal trailing angle between the tangent to the trailing edge of the plane and the chord or a line drawn from the leading to the trailing edge.</p><p>Arc--Any portion of a circle or other curve.</p><p>Aspect--The top or plan view of an aeroplane surface.</p><p>Automatic Stability--Applied to lateral or longitudinal stability maintained by the action of suitable elements on mechanisms independent of any control exercised by the operator. There is a tendency to restrict the term to such stability secured by automatic manipulation of controlling devices, rather than to systems in which balance is maintained by the use of dihedral arrangements.</p><p>Biplane (bi&#39;plane)--An aeroplane with two superposed main surfaces.</p><p>Balance--To maintain equilibrium by hand or automatic movement of balancing surfaces, as opposed to equilibrium maintained by stabilizing.

Still, who claims to have made the discoveries that led to the establishment of the school of Osteopathy, asserts that all diseases and lesions are the result of the luxation, dislocation, or breakage of some bone or bones; this, however, is not now maintained to any great extent by his followers. Osteopathists, though, do generally claim that all diseases arise from some maladjustment of the bones of the human body, and that treatment, therefore, must be to secure the normal adjustment of the bones and ligaments that form the skeleton. They claim that a dislocation is not always necessarily the result of external violence; it may be caused by the ulceration of bones, the elongation of ligaments, or excessive muscular action.</p><p>The constriction of an important artery or vein, which may be caused by a very slightly displaced bone, an indurated muscle, or other organ, may produce an excess of blood in one part of the body, thereby causing a deficiency in some other part. A dislocated member will generally show alteration in the form of the joint and axis of the limb; loss of power and proper motion; increased length or shortening of the limb; prominence at one point and depression at another; greatly impaired circulation, and pain due to the obstruction of nerve force in the parts involved.</p><p>The osteopathist claims that pain and disease arise mainly from some mal-adjustment in some part of the body, and that a return to good health involves treatment for the normal adjustment of the skeleton; he asserts, though any luxation may be only partial, it may cause pressure at some point upon a blood vessel, or a nerve of which the patient may be unconscious, and thus be a barrier to the restoration of good health.</p><p>Osteopathy asserts that trying to heal the body of an ailment caused by a dislocated member, be it a bone, ligament, or nerve, by which abnormal pressure is maintained upon a blood vessel or a nerve, would be like trying to operate a machine with an important cog out of gear. To cure it involves the reduction of a dislocation; the breaking up of adhesions, and the arousing of the enervated organ or organs partially or wholly failing in the performance of function.</p><p>THE LAW OF TRADEMARKS.</p><p>Any person, firm or corporation can obtain protection for any lawful trademark by complying with the following:</p><ol><li><p>By causing to be recorded in the Patent Office the name, residence and place of business of persons desiring the trademark.</p></li><li><p>The class of merchandise and description of the same.</p></li><li><p>A description of the trademark itself with facsimiles.</p></li><li><p>The length of time that the said mark has already been used.</p></li><li><p>By payment of the required fee--$6 for labels and $25 for trademarks.</p></li><li><p>By complying with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Patents.</p></li><li><p>A lawful trademark must consist of some arbitrary word (not the name of a person or place), indicating or not the use or nature of the thing to which it is applied; of some designating symbol, or of both said word and symbol.</p></li></ol><p>HOW TO OBTAIN A PATENT.</p><p>Patents are issued in the name of the United States, and under the seal of the Patent Office. A patent is a grant by the Government to the inventor, his heirs or assigns, for a limited period, of the exclusive right to make, use or sell any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, or any new, original and ornamental design for any article of manufacture.</p><p>Every patent contains a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, for the term of seventeen years, of the exclusive right to make, use and vend the invention or discovery throughout the United States and the Territories, referring to the specification for the particulars thereof.</p><p>If it appears that the inventor, at the time of making his application, believed himself to be the first inventor or discoverer, a patent will not be refused on account of the invention or discovery, or any part thereof, having been known or used in any foreign country before his invention or discovery thereof, if it had not been before patented or described in any printed publication.</p><p>Joint inventors are entitled to a joint patent; neither can claim one separately. Independent inventors of distinct and independent improvements in the same machine cannot obtain a joint patent for their separate inventions; nor does the fact that one furnishes the capital and another makes the invention entitle them to make application as joint inventors; but in such case they may become joint patentees.</p><p>Application for a patent must be made in writing to the Commissioner of Patents, from whom blanks and printed instructions can be obtained by mail.</p><p>REISSUES.--A reissue is granted to the original patentee, his legal representatives, or the assignees of the entire interest, when, by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming as his invention or discovery more than he had a right to claim as new, the original patent is inoperative or invalid, provided the error has arisen from inadvertence, accident or mistake and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention.</p><p>CAVEATS.--A caveat, under the patent law, is a notice given to the office of the caveator&#39;s claim as inventor, in order to prevent the grant of a patent to another for the same alleged invention upon an application filed during the life of the caveat without notice to the caveator.</p><p>Any citizen of the United States who has made a new invention or discovery, and desires further time to mature the same, may, on payment of a fee of $10, file in the Patent Office a caveat setting forth the object and the distinguishing characteristics of the invention, and praying protection of his right until he shall have matured his invention. Such caveat shall be filed in the confidential archives of the office and preserved in secrecy, and shall be operative for the term of one year from the filing thereof.</p><p>An alien has the same privilege, if he has resided in the United States one year next preceding the filing of his caveat, and has made oath of his intention to become a citizen.</p><p>The caveat must comprise a specification, oath, and, when the nature of the case admits of it, a drawing, and, like the application, must be limited to a single invention or improvement.</p><p>FEES.--Fees must be paid in advance, and are as follows. On filing each original application for a patent, $15. On issuing each original patent, $20. In design cases: For three years and six months, $10: for seven years, $15; for fourteen years, $30. On filing each caveat, $10.</p><p>On every application for the reissue of a patent, $30. Added to these are the usual charges of patent solicitors for preparing the application and for drawings etc.</p><p>SHAKESPEARE&#39;S COUNSEL.</p><p>(Polonius&#39; Advice to His Son Laertes.)</p><p>And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character: Give thy thoughts no tongue. Nor any unproportion&#39;d thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch&#39;d, unfledged comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in, Bear &#39;t that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; Take each man&#39;s censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy. But not express&#39;d in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man. * * * Neither a borrower nor a lender be: For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. --&quot;Hamlet,&quot; 1 :3.</p><p>POOR RICHARD&#39;S SAYINGS. (Benjamin Franklin.)</p><p>Drive thy business! Let not thy business drive thee!</p><p>Diligence is the mother of good luck.</p><p>Now I have a sheep and a cow, everybody bids me good morrow.</p><p>If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow some.</p><p>Great estates may venture more, but little boats should keep near shore.</p><p>What maintains one vice would bring up two children.</p><p>God helps them that help themselves.</p><p>Poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue, &#39;Tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright.</p><p>Beware of little expenses; a small leak will sink a great ship.</p><p>For age and want, save while you may. No morning sun lasts a whole day.</p><p>HOW TO MAKE CHANGE QUICKLY.</p><p>Always consider the amount of purchase as if that much money were already counted out, then add to amount of purchase enough small change to make an even dollar, counting out the even dollars last until full amount is made up.</p><p>If the purchase amounts to 57 cents, and you are handed $2.00 in payment, count out 43 cents first to make an even dollar. Then layout the other dollar.</p><p>Should the purchase be $3.69, to be taken out of $20.00, begin with $3.69 as the basis and make up even $4.00 by laying out 31 cents. This 31 cents with the amount of the purchase you will consider as $4.00, and count out even dollars to make up the $20.00 which the customer has handed in.</p><p>MERCHANTS&#39; COST AND PRICE MARKS.</p><p>All merchants use private cipher marks to note cost or selling price of goods. The cipher is usually made up from some short word or sentence of nine or ten letters, as:</p><p>C O R N E L I U S, A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</p><p>Five dollars, according to this key, would be eaa. But generally an extra letter is used to prevent repeating the mark for 0. If the sign for a second 0 in this case were y, we would have eay instead of eaa.</p><p>TIME IN WHICH MONEY DOUBLES.</p><p>Per Simple Compound Ct Interest.

List prices were once upon a time supposed to be retail prices, but of late a system of &quot;long&quot; list prices has come into vogue in many lines of trade--that is, the list price is made exorbitantly high, so that wholesalers can give enormous discounts. These discounts, whether large or small, are called trade discounts, and are usually deducted at a certain rate per cent from the face of invoice.</p><p>The amount of discount generally depends upon size of bill or terms of settlement, or both. Sometimes two or more discounts are allowed. Thus 30% and 5% is expressed 30 and 5 meaning first a discount of 30% and then 5% from the remainder.</p><p>30 and 5 is not 35% but 33-1/3%. 10, 5 and 3 off means three successive discounts.</p><p>A wholesale house allowing 10, 5 and 3 off gets more for its goods than it would at 18 off.</p><p>HOW TO DETECT COUNTERFEIT MONEY.</p><p>In the space at disposal here, it is impossible of course to give a complete illustrated counterfeit detector, but the following simple rules, laid down by Bank Note Examiner Geo. R. Baker, will be found extremely valuable:</p><p>Examine the form and features of all human figures: if graceful, and features distinct, examine the drapery. Notice whether the folds lie naturally, and observe whether the fine strands of the hair are plain and distinct.</p><p>Examine the lettering. In a genuine bill is absolutely perfect. There has never been a counterfeit put out but was more or less defective in the lettering.</p><p>Counterfeiters rarely, if ever, get the imprint or engraver&#39;s name perfect. The shading in the background of the vignette and over and around the letters forming the name of the bank, on a good bill, is even and perfect; on a counterfeit, it is uneven and imperfect.</p><p>The die work around the figures of the denomination should be of the same character as the ornamental work surrounding it.</p><p>Never take a bill deficient in any of these points.</p><p>Big Trees.--Of ninety-two redwood trees in Calaveras Grove, Cal., ten are over thirty feet in diameter, and eighty-two have a diameter of from fifteen to thirty feet.

In all races the male brain is about ten per cent heavier than the female. The highest class of apes has only 16 oz. of brain. A man&#39;s brain, it is estimated, consists of 300,000,000 nerve cells, of which over 3,000 are disintegrated and destroyed every minute. Everyone, therefore, has a new brain once in sixty days. But excessive labor, or lack of sleep, prevents the repair of the tissues, and the brain gradually wastes away. Diversity of occupation, by calling upon different portions of the mind or body successively, affords, in some measure, the requisite repose to each.

A queen bee produces 100,000 eggs in a season.</p><p>There are 9,000 cells in a square foot of honeycomb.</p><p>It requires 2,300 silkworms to produce one pound of silk.</p><p>It would take 27,600 spiders to produce one pound of web.</p><p>THE RULE OF THE ROAD.</p><p>The &quot;rule of the road&quot; in the United States is &quot;turn to the right&quot;; in England it is the reverse. The rule holds in this country in the case where two vehicles going in opposite directions meet. When one vehicle overtakes another the foremost gives way to the left and the other passes by on the &quot;off side&quot;; and when a vehicle is crossing the direction of another it keeps to the left and crosses in its rear. These two rules are the same in this country as in England, and why the rule concerning meeting vehicles should have been changed it is impossible to say.</p><p>CANARY BIRDS.</p><p>How to Keep Them Healthy and in Good Song.</p><p>Place the cage so that no draught of air can strike the bird.</p><p>Give nothing to healthy birds but rape, hemp, canary seed, water, cuttle-fish bone, and gravel, paper or sand on floor of cage.</p><p>A bath three times a week;</p><p>The room should not be overheated.</p><p>When moulting keep warm and avoid all draughts of air.</p><p>Give plenty of German summer rape seed. A little hard-boiled egg mixed with cracker, grated fine, once or twice a week, is excellent.</p><p>Feed at a certain hour in the morning.</p><p>Diseases and Cures.</p><p>Husk or Asthma.--The curatives are aperients, such as endive, water cresses, bread and milk, and red pepper.</p><p>Pip.--Mix red pepper, butter and garlic and swab out the throat.</p><p>Sweating.--Wash the hen in salt and water, and dry rapidly.</p><p>Costiveness.--Plenty of green food and fruit.</p><p>Obstruction of the Rump Gland--Pierce with a needle. Press the inflamed matter out, and drop fine sugar over the wound.</p><p>Lice.--Keep a saucer of fresh water in the cage and the bird will free itself.</p><p>Overgrown Claws or Beak.--Pare carefully with a sharp knife.</p><p>Moulting.--Give plenty of good food and keep warm. Saffron and a rusty nail put in the drinking water is excellent.</p><p>Loss of Voice.--Feed with paste of bread, lettuce and rape seed with yoke of egg. Whisky and sugar is an excellent remedy.</p><p>RECIPES, TRADE SECRETS ETC.</p><p>Toothache Cure.--Compound tinct. benzoin is said to be one of the most certain and speedy cures for toothache; pour a few drops on cotton, and press at once into the diseased cavity, when the pain will almost instantly cease.</p><p>Toothache Tincture.--Mix tannin, 1 scruple; mastic, 3 grains; ether, 2 drams. Apply on cotton wool, to the tooth, previously dried.</p><p>Charcoal Tooth Paste.--Chlorate of potash, 1/2 dram; mint water, 1 ounce. Dissolve and add powdered charcoal, 2 ounces; honey, 1 ounce.</p><p>Excellent Mouth Wash.--Powdered white Castile soap, 2 drams; alcohol, 3 ounces; honey, 1 ounce; essence or extract jasmine, 2 drams. Dissolve the soap in alcohol and add honey and extract.</p><p>Removing Tartar from the Teeth.--This preparation is used by dentists. Pure muriatic acid, one ounce; water, one ounce; honey, two ounces; mix thoroughly. Take a toothbrush, and wet it freely with this preparation, and briskly rub the black teeth, and in a moment&#39;s time they will be perfectly white; then immediately wash out the mouth well with water, that the acid may not act on the enamel of the teeth. This should be done only occasionally.</p><p>Test for Glue.--The following simple and easy test for glue is given: A weighed piece of glue (say one-third of an ounce) is suspended in water for twenty-four hours, the temperature of which is not above fifty degrees Fahrenheit. The coloring material sinks, and the glue swells from the absorption of the water. The glue is then taken out and weighed; the greater the increase in weight the better the glue. If it then be dried perfectly and weighed again, the weight of the coloring matter can be learned from the difference between this and the original weight.</p><p>Bad Breath.--Bad breath from catarrh, foul stomach or bad teeth may be temporarily relieved by diluting a little bromo chloralum with eight or ten parts of water, and using it as a gargle, and swallowing a few drops before going out. A pint of bromo chloralum costs fifty cents, but a small vial will last a long time.</p><p>Good Tooth Powder.--Procure, at a druggist&#39;s, half an ounce of powdered orris root, half an ounce of prepared chalk finely pulverized, and two or three small lumps of Dutch pink. Let them all be mixed in a mortar, and pounded together. The Dutch pink is to impart a pale reddish color. Keep it in a close box.</p><p>Another Tooth Powder.--Mix together, in a mortar, half an ounce of red Peruvian bark, finely powdered, a quarter of an ounce of powdered myrrh, and a quarter of an ounce of prepared chalk.</p><p>A Safe Depilatory.--Take a strong solution of sulphuret of barium, and add enough finely powdered starch to make a paste. Apply to the roots of the hair and allow it to remain on a few minutes, then scrape off with the back edge of a knife blade, and rub with sweet oil.</p><p>Quick Depilatory for Removing Hair.--Best slaked lime, 6 ounces; orpiment, fine powder, 1 ounce. Mix with a covered sieve and preserve in a dry place in closely stoppered bottles. In using mix the powder with enough water to form a paste, and apply to the hair to be removed. In about five minutes, or as soon as its caustic action is felt on the skin, remove, as in shaving, with an ivory or bone paper knife, wash with cold water freely, and apply cold cream.</p><p>Tricopherus for the Hair.--Castor oil, alcohol, each 1 pint; tinct. cantharides, 1 ounce; oil bergamot, 1/2 ounce; alkanet coloring, to color as wished. Mix and let it stand forty-eight hours, with occasional shaking, and then filter.</p><p>Liquid Shampoo.--Take bay rum. 2-1/2 pints; water, 1/2 pint; glycerine, 1 ounce; tinct. cantharides, 2 drams; carbonate of ammonia, 2 drams; borax, 1/2 ounce; or take of New England rum, 1-1/2 pints; bay rum, 1 pint; water, 1/2 pint; glycerine, 1 ounce; tinct. cantharides, 2 drams, ammon. carbonate, 2 drams; borax, 1/2 ounce; the salts to be dissolved in water and the other ingredients to be added gradually.</p><p>Cleaning Hair Brushes.--Put a teaspoonful or dessertspoonful of aqua ammonia into a basin half full of water, comb the loose hairs out of the brush, then agitate the water briskly with the brush, and rinse it well with clear water.</p><p>Hair Invigorator.--Bay rum, two pints; alcohol, one pint; castor oil, one ounce; carb. ammonia, half an ounce; tincture of cantharides, one ounce. Mix them well. This compound will promote the growth of the hair and prevent it from falling out.</p><p>For Dandruff.--Take glycerine, four ounces; tincture of cantharides, five ounces; bay rum, four ounces; water, two ounces. Mix and apply once a day, and rub well into the scalp.</p><p>Mustache Grower.--Simple cerate, 1 ounce; oil bergamot, 10 minims; saturated tinct. of cantharides, 15 minims. Rub them together thoroughly, or melt the cerate and stir in the tincture while hot, and the oil as soon as it is nearly cold, then run into molds or rolls. To be applied as a pomade, rubbing in at the roots of the hair. Care must be used not to inflame the skin by too frequent application.</p><p>Razor-strop Paste.--Wet the strop with a little sweet oil, and apply a little flour of emery evenly over the surface.</p><p>Shaving Compound.--Half a pound of plain white soap, dissolved in a small quantity of alcohol, as little as can be used; add a tablespoonful of pulverized borax. Shave the soap and put it in a small tin basin or cup; place it on the fire in a dish of boiling water; when melted, add the alcohol, and remove from the fire; stir in oil of bergamot sufficient to perfume it.</p><p>Cure for Prickly Heat.--Mix a large portion of wheat bran with either cold or lukewarm water, and use it as a bath twice or thrice a day. Children who are covered with prickly heat in warm weather will be thus effectually relieved from that tormenting eruption. As soon as it begins to appear on the neck, face or arms, commence using the bran water on these parts repeatedly through the day, and it may probably spread no farther. If it does, the bran water bath will certainly cure it, if persisted in.</p><p>To Remove Corns from Between the Toes.--These corns are generally more painful than any others, and are frequently situated as to be almost inaccessible to the usual remedies. Wetting them several times a day with hartshorn will in most cases cure them. Try it.</p><p>Superior Cologne Water.--Oil of lavender, two drams; oil of rosemary, one dram and a half; orange, lemon and bergamot, one dram each of the oil; also two drams of the essence of musk, attar of rose, ten drops, and a pint of proof spirit. Shake all together thoroughly three times a day for a week.</p><p>Inexhaustible Smelling Salts.--Sal tartar, three drams; muriate ammonia, granulated, 6 drams; oil neroli. 5 minims; oil lavender flowers, 5 minims; oil rose, 3 minims; spirits ammonia, 15 minims. Put into the pungent a small piece of sponge filling about one-fourth the space, and pour on it a due proportion of the oils, then put in the mixed salts until the bottle is three-fourths full, and pour on the spirits of ammonia in proper proportion and close the bottle.</p><p>Volatile Salts for Pungents.--Liquor ammon., 1 pint; oil lavender flowers, 1 dram; oil rosemary, fine, 1 dram; oil bergamot, 1/2 dram; oil peppermint, 10 minims. Mix thoroughly and fill pungents or keep in well stoppered bottle. Another formula is, sesqui-carbonate of ammonia, small pieces, 10 ounces; concentrated liq. ammonia, 5 ounces. Put the sesqui-carb. in a wide-mouthed jar with air-tight stopper, perfume the liquor ammonia to suit and pour over the carbonate; close tightly the lid and place in a cool place; stir with a stiff spatula every other day for a week, and then keep it closed for two weeks, or until it becomes hard, when it is ready for use.</p><p>Paste for Papering Boxes.--Boil water and stir in batter of wheat or rye flour. Let it boil one minute, take off and strain through a colander. Add, while boiling, a little glue or powdered alum. Do plenty of stirring while the paste is cooking, and make of consistency that will spread nicely.</p><p>Aromatic Spirit of Vinegar.--Acetic acid, No. 8. pure, 8 ounces; camphor, 1/2 ounce. Dissolve and add oil lemon, oil lavender flowers, each two drams; oil cassia, oil cloves, 1/2 dram each. Thoroughly mix and keep in well stoppered bottle.</p><p>Rose-Water.--Preferable to the distilled for a perfume, or for ordinary purposes. Attar of rose, twelve drops; rub it up with half an ounce of white sugar and two drams carbonate magnesia, then add gradually one quart of water and two ounces of proof spirit, and filter through paper.</p><p>Bay Rum.--French proof spirit, one gallon; extract bay, six ounces. Mix and color with caramel; needs no filtering.</p><p>Fine Lavender Water.--Mix together, in a clean bottle, a pint of inodorous spirit of wine, an ounce of oil of lavender, a teaspoonful of oil of bergamot, and a tablespoonful of oil of ambergris.</p><p>The Virtues of Turpentine.--After a housekeeper fully realizes the worth of turpentine in the household, she is never willing to be without a supply of it. It gives quick relief to burns, it is an excellent application for corns, it is good for rheumatism and sore throat, and it is the quickest remedy for convulsions or fits. Then it is a sure preventive against moths: by just dropping a trifle in the bottom of drawers, chests and cupboards, it will render the garments secure from injury during the summer. It will keep ants and bugs from closets and store-rooms by putting a few drops in the corners and upon the shelves; it is sure destruction to bedbugs, and will effectually drive them away from their haunts if thoroughly applied to all the joints of the bedstead in the spring cleaning time, and injures neither furniture nor clothing. A spoonful of it added to a pail of warm water is excellent for cleaning paint. A little in suds washing days lightens laundry labor.</p><p>A Perpetual Paste is a paste that may be made by dissolving an ounce of alum in a quart of warm water. When cold, add as much flour as will make it the consistency of cream, then stir into it half a teaspoonful of powdered resin, and two or three cloves. Boil it to a consistency of mush, stirring all the time. It will keep for twelve months, and when dry may be softened with warm water.</p><p>Paste for Scrap Books.--Take half a teaspoonful of starch, same of flour, pour on a little boiling water, let it stand a minute, add more water, stir and cook it until it is thick enough to starch a shirt bosom. It spreads smooth, sticks well and will not mold or discolor paper. Starch alone will make a very good paste.</p><p>A Strong Paste.--A paste that will neither decay nor become moldy. Mix good clean flour with cold water into a thick paste well blended together; then add boiling water, stirring well up until it is of a consistency that can be easily and smoothly spread with a brush; add to this a spoonful or two of brown sugar, a little corrosive sublimate and about half a dozen drops of oil of lavender, and you will have a paste that will hold with wonderful tenacity.</p><p>A Brilliant Paste.--A brilliant and adhesive paste, adapted to fancy articles, may be made by dissolving caseine precipitated from milk by acetic acid and washed with pure water in a saturated solution of borax.</p><p>A Sugar Paste.--In order to prevent the gum from cracking, to ten parts by weight of gum arabic and three parts of sugar add water until the desired consistency is obtained. If a very strong paste is required, add a quantity of flour equal in weight to the gum, without boiling the mixture. The paste improves in strength when it begins to ferment.</p><p>Tin Box Cement.--To fix labels to tin boxes either of the following will answer: 1. Soften good glue in water, then boil it in strong vinegar, and thicken the liquid while boiling with fine wheat flour, so that a paste results. 2. Starch paste, with which a little Venice turpentine has been incorporated while warm.</p><p>Paper and Leather Paste.--Cover four parts, by weight, of glue, with fifteen parts of cold water, and allow it to soak for several hours, then warm moderately till the solution is perfectly clear, and dilute with sixty parts of boiling water, intimately stirred in. Next prepare a solution of thirty parts of starch in two hundred parts of cold water, so as to form a thin homogeneous liquid, free from lumps, and pour the boiling glue solution into it with thorough stirring, and at the same time keep the mass boiling.</p><p>Commercial Mucilage.--The best quality of mucilage in the market is made by dissolving clear glue in equal volumes of water and strong vinegar, and adding one-fourth of an equal volume of alcohol, and a small quantity of a solution of alum in water. Some of the cheaper preparations offered for sale are merely boiled starch or flour, mixed with nitric acid to prevent their gelatinizing.</p><p>Acid-Proof Paste.--A paste formed by mixing powdered glass with a concentrated solution of silicate of soda makes an excellent acid-proof cement.</p><p>Paste to Fasten Cloth to Wood.--Take a plump pound of wheat flour, one tablespoonful of powdered resin, one tablespoonful of finely powdered alum, and rub the mixture in a suitable vessel, with water, to a uniform, smooth paste; transfer this to a small kettle over a fire, and stir until the paste is perfectly homogeneous without lumps. As soon as the mass has become so stiff that the stirrer remains upright in it, transfer it to another vessel and cover it up so that no skin may form on its surface. This paste is applied in a very thin layer to the surface of the table; the cloth, or leather, is then laid and pressed upon it, and smoothed with a roller. The ends are cut off after drying. If leather is to be fastened on, this must first be moistened with water. The paste is then applied, and the leather rubbed smooth with a cloth.</p><p>Paste for Printing Office.--Take two gallons of cold water and one quart wheat flour, rub out all the lumps, then add one-fourth pound of finely pulverized alum and boil the mixture for ten minutes, or until a thick consistency is reached. Now add one quart of hot water and, boil again, until the paste becomes a pale brown color, and thick. The paste should be well stirred during both processes of cooking. Paste thus made will keep sweet for two weeks and prove very adhesive.</p><p>To Take Smoke Stains from Walls.--An easy and sure way to remove smoke stains from common plain ceilings is to mix wood ashes with the whitewash just before applying. A pint of ashes to a small pail of whitewash is sufficient, but a little more or less will do no harm.</p><p>To Remove Stains from Broadcloth.--Take an ounce of pipe clay, which has been ground fine, mix it with twelve drops of alcohol and the same quantity of spirits of turpentine. Whenever you wish to remove any stains from cloth, moisten a little of this mixture with alcohol and rub it on the spots. Let it remain till dry, then rub it off with a woolen cloth, and the spots will disappear.</p><p>To Remove Red Stains of Fruit from Linen.--Moisten the cloth and hold it over a piece of burning sulphur; then wash thoroughly, or else the spots may reappear.</p><p>To Remove Oil Stains.--Take three ounces of spirits of turpentine and one ounce of essence of lemon, mix well, and apply it as you would any other scouring drops. It will take out all the grease.</p><p>Iron Stains may be removed by the salt of lemons. Many stains may be removed by dipping the linen in some buttermilk, and then drying it in a hot sun; wash it in cold water; repeat this three or four times.</p><p>To Remove Oil Stains from Wood.--Mix together fuller&#39;s earth and soap lees, and rub it into the boards. Let it dry and then scour it off with some strong soft soap and sand, or use lees to scour it with. It should be put on hot, which may easily be done by heating the lees.</p><p>To Remove Tea Stains.--Mix thoroughly soft soap and salt--say a tablespoonful of salt to a teacupful of soap, rub on the spots, and spread the cloth on the grass where the sun will shine on it. Let it lie two or three days, then wash. If the spots are wet occasionally while lying on the grass, it will hasten the bleaching.</p><p>To Remove Stains from Muslin.--If you have stained your muslin or gingham dress, or similar articles, with berries, before wetting with anything else, pour boiling water through the stains and they will disappear. Before fruit juice dries it can often be removed by cold water, using a sponge and towel if necessary.</p><p>To Remove Acid Stains.--Stains caused by acids may be removed by tying some pearlash up in the stained part; scrape some soap in cold, soft water, and boil the linen until the stain is gone.</p><p>To Disinfect Sinks and Drains.--Copperas dissolved in water, one-fourth of a pound to a gallon, and poured into a sink and water drain occasionally, will keep such places sweet and wholesome. A little chloride of lime, say half a pound to a gallon of water, will have the same effect, and either of these costs but a trifle.</p><p>A preparation may be made at home which will answer about as well as the chloride of lime. Dissolve a bushel of salt in a barrel of water, and with the salt water slake a barrel of lime, which should be made wet enough to form a thin paste or wash.</p><p>To Disinfect a Cellar.--A damp, musty cellar may be sweetened by sprinkling upon the floor pulverized copperas, chloride of lime, or even common lime. The most effective means I have ever used to disinfect decaying vegetable matter is chloride of lime in solution. One pound may be dissolved in two gallons of water. Plaster of Paris has also been found an excellent absorbent of noxious odors. If used one part with three parts of charcoal, it will be found still better.</p><p>How to Thaw Out a Water Pipe.--Water pipes usually freeze up when exposed, for inside the walls, where they cannot be reached, they are or should be packed to prevent freezing. To thaw out a frozen pipe, bundle a newspaper into a torch, light it, and pass it along the pipe slowly. The ice will yield to this much quicker than to hot water or wrappings or hot cloths, as is the common practice.</p><p>To Prevent Mold.--A small quantity of carbolic acid added to paste, mucilage and ink, will prevent mold. An ounce of the acid to a gallon of whitewash will keep cellars and dairies from the disagreeable odor which often taints milk and meat kept in such places.</p><p>Thawing Frozen Gas Pipe.--Mr. F. H. Shelton says: &quot;I took off from over the pipe, some four or five inches, just a crust of earth, and then put a couple of bushels of lime in the space, poured water over it, and slaked it, and then put canvas over that, and rocks on the canvas, so as to keep the wind from getting underneath. Next morning, on returning there, I found that the frost had been drawn out from the ground for nearly three feet. You can appreciate what an advantage that was, for picking through frozen ground, with the thermometer below zero, is no joke. Since then we have tried it several times. It is an excellent plan if you have time enough to let the time work. In the daytime you cannot afford to waste the time, but if you have a spare night in which to work, it is worth while to try it.&quot;</p><p>How to Test a Thermometer.--The common thermometer in a japanned iron case is usually inaccurate. To test the thermometer, bring water into the condition of active boiling, warm the thermometer gradually in the steam and then plunge it into the water. If it indicates a fixed temperature of two hundred and twelve degrees, the instrument is a good one.</p><p>Indelible Ink.--An indelible ink that cannot be erased, even with acids, can be obtained from the following recipe: To good gall ink add a strong solution of Prussian blue dissolved in distilled water. This will form a writing fluid which cannot be erased without destruction of the paper. The ink will write greenish blue, but afterward will turn black.</p><p>To Get a Broken Cork Out of a Bottle.--If, in drawing a cork, it breaks, and the lower part falls down into the liquid, tie a long loop in a bit of twine, or small cord, and put it in, holding the bottle so as to bring the piece of cork near to the lower part of the neck. Catch it in the loop, so as to hold it stationary. You can then easily extract it with a corkscrew.</p><p>A Wash for Cleaning Silver.--Mix together half an ounce of fine salt, half an ounce of powdered alum, and half an ounce of cream of tartar. Put them into a large white-ware pitcher, and pour on two ounces of water, and stir them frequently, till entirely dissolved. Then transfer the mixture to clean bottles and cork them closely. Before using it, shake the bottles well. Pour some of the liquid into a bowl, and wash the silver all over with it, using an old, soft, fine linen cloth. Let it stand about ten minutes, and then rub it dry with a buckskin. It will make the silver look like new.</p><p>To Remove the Odor from a Vial.--The odor of its last contents may be removed from a vial by filling it with cold water, and letting it stand in any airy place uncorked for three days, changing the water every day.</p><p>To Loosen a Glass Stopper.--The manner in which apothecaries loosen glass stoppers when there is difficulty in getting them out is to press the thumb of the right hand very hard against the lower part of the stopper, and then give the stopper a twist the other way, with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, keeping the bottle stiff in a steady position.</p><p>To Soften Boots and Shoes.--Kerosene will soften boots and shoes which have been hardened by water, and render them as pliable as new.</p><p>To Remove Stains, Spots, and Mildew from Furniture.--Take half a pint of ninety-eight per cent alcohol, a quarter of an ounce each of pulverized resin and gum shellac, add half a pint of linseed oil, shake well and apply with a brush or sponge. Sweet oil will remove finger marks from varnished furniture, and kerosene from oiled furniture.</p><p>To Freshen Gilt Frames.--Gilt frames may be revived by carefully dusting them, and then washing with one ounce of soda beaten up with the whites of three eggs. Scraped patches should be touched up with gold paint. Castile soap and water, with proper care, may be used to clean oil paintings. Other methods should not be employed without some skill.</p><p>To Fill Cracks in Plaster.--Use vinegar instead of water to mix your plaster of Paris. The resultant mass will be like putty, and will not &quot;set&quot; for twenty or thirty minutes, whereas if you use water the plaster will become hard almost immediately, before you have time to use it. Push it into the cracks and smooth it off nicely with a table knife.</p><p>To Toughen Lamp Chimneys and Glassware.--Immerse the article in a pot filled with cold water, to which some common salt has been added. Boil the water well, then cool slowly. Glass treated in this way will resist any sudden change of temperature.</p><p>To Remove Paint from Window-Glass.--Rub it well with hot, sharp vinegar.</p><p>To Clean Stovepipe.--A piece of zinc put on the live coals in the stove will clean out the stovepipe.</p><p>To Brighten Carpets.--Carpets after the dust has been beaten out may be brightened by scattering upon them cornmeal mixed with salt and then sweeping it off. Mix salt and meal in equal proportions. Carpets should be thoroughly beaten on the wrong side first and then on the right side, after which spots may be removed by the use of ox-gall or ammonia and water.</p><p>To Keep Flowers Fresh exclude them from the air. To do this wet them thoroughly, put in a damp box, and cover with wet raw cotton or wet newspaper, then place in a cool spot. To preserve bouquets, put a little saltpetre in the water you use for your bouquets, and the flowers will live for a fortnight.</p><p>To Preserve Brooms.--Dip them for a minute or two in a kettle of boiling suds once a week and they will last much longer, making them tough and pliable. A carpet wears much longer swept with a broom cared for in this manner.</p><p>To Clean Brassware.--Mix one ounce of oxalic acid, six ounces of rotten stone, all in powder, one ounce of sweet oil, and sufficient water to make a paste. Apply a small proportion, and rub dry with a flannel or leather. The liquid dip most generally used consists of nitric and sulphuric acids, but this is more corrosive.</p><p>To Keep Out Mosquitoes.--If a bottle of the oil of pennyroyal is left uncorked in a room at night, not a mosquito, nor any other blood-sucker, will be found there in the morning.</p><p>To Kill Cockroaches.--A teacupful of well bruised plaster of Paris, mixed with double the quantity of oatmeal, to which a little sugar may be added, although this last named ingredient is not essential. Strew it on the floor, or into the chinks where they frequent.</p><p>To Destroy Ants.--Drop some quicklime on the mouth of their nest, and wash it with boiling water, or dissolve some camphor in spirits of wine, then mix with water, and pour into their haunts; or tobacco water, which has been found effectual. They are averse to strong scents. Camphor, or a sponge saturated with creosote, will prevent their infesting a cupboard. To prevent their climbing up trees, place a ring of tar about the trunk, or a circle of rag moistened occasionally with creosote.</p><p>To Prevent Moths.--In the month of April or May, beat your fur garments well with a small cane or elastic stick, then wrap them up in linen, without pressing them too hard, and put betwixt the folds some camphor in small lumps; then put your furs in this state in boxes well closed. When the furs are wanted for use, beat them well as before, and expose them for twenty-four hours to the air, which will take away the smell of the camphor. If the fur has long hair, as bear or fox, add to the camphor an equal quantity of black pepper in powder.</p><p>To Get Rid of Moths--</p><ol><li><p>Procure shavings of cedar wood, and inclose in muslin bags, which can be distributed freely among the clothes.</p></li><li><p>Procure shavings of camphor wood, and inclose in bags.</p></li><li><p>Sprinkle pimento (allspice) berries among the clothes.</p></li><li><p>Sprinkle the clothes with the seeds of the musk plant.</p></li><li><p>To destroy the eggs, when deposited in woolen cloths, etc., use a solution of acetate of potash in spirits of rosemary, fifteen grains to the pint.</p></li></ol><p>Bed Bugs.--Spirits of naphtha rubbed with a small painter&#39;s brush into every part of the bedstead is a certain way of getting rid of bugs. The mattress and binding of the bed should be examined, and the same process attended to, as they generally harbor more in these parts than in the bedstead. Ten cents&#39; worth of naphtha is sufficient for one bed.</p><p>Bug Poison.--Proof spirit, one pint; camphor, two ounces; oil of turpentine, four ounces; corrosive sublimate, one ounce. Mix. A correspondent says: &quot;I have been for a long time troubled with bugs, and never could get rid of them by any clean and expeditious method, until a friend told me to suspend a small bag of camphor to the bed, just in the center, overhead. I did so, and the enemy was most effectually repulsed, and has not made his appearance since--not even for a reconnoissance!&quot; This is a simple method of getting rid of these pests, and is worth a trial to see if it be effectual in other cases.</p><p>Mixture for Destroying Flies--Infusion of quassia, one pint; brown sugar, four ounces; ground pepper, two ounces. To be well mixed together, and put in small, shallow dishes when required.</p><p>To Destroy Flies in a room, take half a teaspoonful of black pepper in powder, one teaspoonful of brown sugar, and one tablespoonful of cream, mix them well together, and place them in the room on a plate, where the flies are troublesome, and they will soon disappear.</p><p>To Drive Flies from the House.--A good way to rid the house of flies is to saturate small cloths with oil of sassafras and lay them in windows and doors. The flies will soon leave.</p><p>Aging Oak.--Strong ammonia fumes may be used for aging oak. Place the piece to be fumed, with an evaporating dish containing concentrated ammonia, in a box, and close it airtight. Leave for 12 hours and finish with a wax polish, applying first a thin coat of paraffine oil and then rubbing with a pomade of prepared wax made as follows: Two ounces each of yellow and white beeswax heated over a slow fire in a clean vessel (agate ware is good) until melted. Add 4 oz. turpentine and stir till entirely cool. Keep the turpentine away from the fire. This will give the oak a lustrous brown color, and nicking will not expose a different surface, as the ammonia fumes penetrate to a considerable depth.</p><p>OPPORTUNITY.</p><p>They do me wrong who say I come no more When once I&#39;ve knocked and failed to find you in; For every day I stand outside your door, And bid you wake and ride, to fight and win.</p><p>Wail not for precious chances passed away, Weep not for golden ages on the wane; Each night I burn the records of the day; At sunrise every soul is born again.</p><p>Laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped; To vanished hopes be blind and deaf and dumb; My judgments seal the dead past with its dead, But never bind a moment yet to come.</p><p>Though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep: I lend my arm to all who say. &quot;I can.&quot; No shamefaced outcast ever sank so deep But yet might rise and be again a man!</p><p>Dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast? Dost reel from righteous retribution&#39;s blow? Then turn from blotted archives of the past. And find the future&#39;s pages white as snow.</p><p>Art thou a mourner? Rouse thee from thy spell! Art thou a sinner? Sins may be forgiven; Each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell.

SPURZHEIM&#39;S PHRENOLOGY.</p><p>The first claim put forth by the teachers and professional demonstrators of phrenology makes it a system of mental philosophy, besides at the same time presenting a much more popular aspect as a method whereby the disposition, character and natural aptitude of the individual may be ascertained.</p><p>[Illustration: Side and front view of a head, with several numbered areas above the eyes and ears.]</p><p>These two features of the subject are quite distinct from each other, for, while it can serve as a reliable guide for reading character only on the assumption of its truth as a philosophic system, yet the possibility of its practical application does not necessarily follow from the establishment of the truth of its theoretical side.</p><p>Two of the earliest founders of the science of anatomy, Erasistratus and Herophilus, who lived in the age of Ptolemy Soter, taught that the brain was the seat of sensation and intellect, and that there was therein a certain degree of localization of function. Galen later taught that the brain is the seat of the soul and intellect. From these facts of history the system of phrenology, though formulated by Dr. Gall, Dr. Spurzheim, the Fowler Brothers and others, rests upon deductions derived from the teachings of the demonstrators of anatomy and students of philosophy.</p><p>The formulated system of phrenology is very generally believed to be a modern expansion of an old empirical philosophy, but, according to Dr. Gall&#39;s account, it arose with him as the result of independent observations. The popularity of phrenology has waned in the public mind, and cultivation of the system is confined to a few enthusiasts, such as pose as teachers of it as a vocation. These claim that phrenology is a practical and important science and that it rests upon the following principles:</p><p>First--That the human brain is the organ of the mind.</p><p>Second--That the mental powers of man can be analyzed into a definite number of measurably independent faculties.</p><p>Third--That these faculties are innate, and each has its seat in a definite region of the brain.</p><p>Fourth--That the size of each of these regions is the measure of the power of manifesting the faculty associated with it.</p><p>The faculties and their localities, as originally constructed by Dr. Gall, were for the most part identified on slender grounds. His procedure was as follows: Having selected the place of a faculty, he examined the heads of his friends and casts of persons with that peculiarity in common, and in them sought for the distinctive feature of their characteristic trait. Some of his earlier studies were among low associates in jails and lunatic asylums, and some of the qualities located by him were such as tend to perversion to crime. These he named after their excessive manifestations, and thus mapped out organs of theft, murder, etc. This, however, caused the system to be discredited. Later his pupil, Dr. Spurzheim, claimed that the moral and religious features belonging to it greatly modified these characteristics of Dr. Gall&#39;s work. The chart of the human head as invented by Dr. Gall represented 26 organs; the chart as improved by Dr. Spurzheim makes out 35 organs. This is the chart now generally used and which is shown on a preceding page. The number specifies the location of each organ, which is followed by its phrenological name, and classified as follows:</p><p>Propensities. (1) Amativeness. (2) Philoprogenitiveness. (3) Concentrativeness. (4) Adhesiveness. (5) Combativeness. (6) Destructiveness. (6a) Alimentiveness. (7) Secretiveness. (8) Acquisitiveness. (9) Constructiveness.</p><p>Lower Sentiments. (10) Self-esteem. (11) Love of Approbation. (12) Cautiousness.</p><p>Superior Sentiments. (13) Benevolence. (14) Veneration. (15) Conscientiousness. (16) Firmness. (17) Hope. (18) Wonder. (19) Ideality. (20) Wit. (21) Imitation.</p><p>Perceptive Faculties. (22) Individuality. (23) Form. (24) Size. (25) Weight. (26) Color. (27) Locality. (28) Number. (29) Order. (30) Eventuality. (31) Time. (32) Tune. (33) Language.</p><p>Reflective Faculties. (34) Comparison. (35) Causality. The judgment of the phrenologist is determined by the size of the brain in general, and by the size of the organs that have been formulated, and these are estimated by certain arbitrary rules that render the boundaries of the regions indefinite.</p><p>The controversy over phrenology has served undoubtedly the very useful purpose of stimulating research into the anatomy of the brain.</p><p>It is generally conceded that any psychological theory which correlates brain-action and mental phenomena requires a correspondence between the size of the brain and mental power, and generally observation shows that the brains of those whose capacities are above the average are larger than those of the general run of their fellow men.</p><p>A study of the cuts and comparison of the sizes of different heads and their shape will prove very entertaining with most any group of persons intellectually inclined, and it will be found that persons who are naturally good readers by instinct of human nature can, with its help, make remarkable readings in the delineation of character.</p><p>PRINCIPLES OF PARLIAMENTARY LAW.</p><p>List of Motions Arranged According to Their Purpose and Effect.</p><p>[Letters refer to the rules below.]</p><p>Modifying or amending. 8.

The schoolmaster, Jablowsky, prepared a festival in commemoration of the event, and had it end with a ballet performed by thirteen students, dressed as cavaliers. Each had a shield, upon which one of the letters of the words &quot;Domus Lescinia&quot; (The Lescinskian House) was written in gold. After the first dance, they stood in such a manner that their shields read &quot;Domus Lescinia&quot;; after the second dance, they changed order, making it read, &quot;Ades incolumnis&quot; (Unharmed art thou here); after the third. &quot;Mane sidus loci&quot; (Continue the star of this place); after the fourth, &quot;Sis coumna Dei&quot; (Be a pillar of God); and finally, &quot;I! scade solium!&quot; (Go! ascend the throne). Indeed, these two words allow of 1,556,755,200 transpositions; yet that five of them convey independent and appropriate meanings is certainly very curious.</p><p>POINTS OF CRIMINAL LAW.</p><p>You cannot lawfully condone an offence by receiving back stolen property,</p><p>The exemption of females from arrest applies only in civil, not in criminal matters.</p><p>Every man is bound to obey the call of a sheriff for assistance in making an arrest.</p><p>The rule &quot;Every man&#39;s house is his castle&quot; does not hold good when a man is accused of crime.</p><p>Embezzlement can be charged only against a clerk or servant, or the officer or agent of a corporation.</p><p>Bigamy cannot be proven in law if one party to a marriage has been absent and not heard from for five years.</p><p>Grand larceny is when the value of property stolen exceeds $25.00--When less than that, the offence is petit larceny.</p><p>Arson to be in the first degree must have been committed at night and the buildings fired must have been inhabited.</p><p>Drunkenness is not a legal excuse for crime, but delirium tremens is considered by the law as a species of insanity.</p><p>In a case of assault it is only necessary to prove an &quot;offer or attempt at assault.&quot;</p><p>Battery presumes physical violence.</p><p>Mayhem, although popularly supposed to refer to injury to the face, lip, tongue, eye, or ear, applies to any injury done a limb.</p><p>A felony is a crime punishable by imprisonment in a State prison; an &quot;infamous&quot; crime is one punishable with death or State prison.</p><p>A police officer is not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant unless he has personal knowledge of the offense for which the arrest is made.</p><p>An accident is not a crime, unless criminal carelessness can be proven. A man shooting at a burglar and killing a member of his family is not a murderer.</p><p>Burglary in the first degree can be committed only in the night time. Twilight, if dark enough to prevent distinguishing a man&#39;s face, is the same as &quot;night&quot; in law.</p><p>Murder to be in the first degree must be willful, premeditated and malicious, or committed while the murderer is engaged in a felonious act. The killing of a man in a duel is murder, and it is a misdemeanor to accept or give a challenge.</p><p>False swearing is perjury in law only when willfully done, and when the oath has been legally administered. Such qualifying expressions as &quot;to the best of my belief,&quot; &quot;as I am informed,&quot; may save an averment from being perjured. The law is that the false statement sworn to must be absolute. Subornation of perjury is a felony.</p><p>TO TELL PURE WATER.</p><p>The color, odor, taste and purity of water can be ascertained as follows: Fill a large bottle made of colorless glass with water; look through the water at some black object. Pour out some of the water and leave the bottle half full; cork the bottle and place it for a few hours in a warm place; shake up the water, remove the cork, and critically smell the air contained in the bottle. If it has any smell, particularly if the odor is repulsive, the water should not be used for domestic purposes. By heating the water an odor is evolved that would not otherwise appear. Water fresh from the well is usually tasteless, even if it contains a large amount of putrescible organic matter. All water for domestic purposes should be perfectly tasteless, and remain so even after it has been warmed, since warming often develops a taste in water which is tasteless when cold.</p><p>HAND GRENADES.</p><p>Take chloride of calcium, crude, 20 parts; common salt, 5 parts; and water, 75 parts. Mix and put in thin bottles. In case of fire, a bottle so thrown that it will break in or very near the fire will put it out. This mixture is better and cheaper than many of the high-priced grenades sold for the purpose of fire protection.</p><p>HOW TO GET RID OF RATS.</p><p>Get a piece of lead pipe and use it as a funnel to introduce about 1-1/2 ounces of sulphite of potassium into any outside holes tenanted by rats. Not to be used in dwellings. To get rid of mice use tartar emetic mingled with any favorite food; they will eat, sicken and take their leave.</p><p>FRIENDLY ADVICE ON MANY SUBJECTS.</p><p>Tomato in Bright&#39;s Disease.</p><p>When Thomas Jefferson brought the tomato from France to America, thinking that if it could be induced to grow bountifully it might make good feed for hogs, he little dreamed of the benefit he was conferring upon posterity. A constant diet of raw tomatoes and skim-milk is said to be a certain cure for Bright&#39;s disease. Gen. Schenck, who, when Minister to England, became a victim to that complaint, was restored to health by two years of this regimen.</p><p>Relief for Asthma.</p><p>An old friend of the editor of this book writes: &quot;I have been a sufferer from asthma for twenty-five years, and for more than a dozen years have used the following recipe with great benefit. It is not a cure, but in my case gives almost instant relief. Take equal parts of powdered stramonium leaves and powdered belladonna leaves and mix thoroughly; to each ten ounces of the mixture add one ounce of powdered saltpeter (nitrate of potash); mix all thoroughly. I always keep some of this in a small tin box. When I wish to use it I pour a little of the powder into the cover of the box, light it with a match, cover the whole with a little paper cone with the point cut off. I place the point of the cone in my mouth, and breathe the smoke into my lungs with the air. The first trial is very hard; it almost strangles, but if persevered in will give great relief. This is much better than stramonium alone. The saltpeter makes it burn freely, and also helps to give relief. When my home was in Northern Indiana, I used to buy the leaves in Chicago already powdered. Now I send to New York. I find it cheaper to do this than to gather and dry the leaves. It is also almost impossible to dry and pulverize the leaves at home. By using a paper cone and breathing through it, little or no smoke is wasted, and the box and paper can be carried in the pocket and used as occasion requires.&quot;</p><p>For Swollen Feet.</p><p>Policemen, mail carriers, and others whose occupation keeps them on their feet a great deal, often are troubled with chafed, sore and blistered feet, especially in extremely hot weather, no matter how comfortably their shoes may lit. A powder is used in the German army for sifting into the shoes and stockings of the foot soldiers, called &quot;Fusstreupulver,&quot; and consists of 3 parts salicylic acid, 10 parts starch and 87 parts pulverized soapstone.</p><p>Rules for Fat People and for Lean.</p><p>To increase the weight: Eat to the extent of satisfying; a natural appetite, of fat meats, butter, cream, milk, cocoa, chocolate, bread, potatoes, peas, parsnips, carrots, beets, farinaceous foods, as Indian corn, rice, tapioca, sago, corn starch, pastry, custards, oatmeal, sugar, sweet wines, and ale. Avoid acids. Exercise as little as possible, and sleep all you can.</p><p>To reduce the weight: Eat to the extent of satisfying a natural appetite, of lean meat, poultry, game, eggs, milk moderately, green vegetables, turnips, succulent fruits, tea or coffee. Drink lime juice, lemonade, and acid drinks. Avoid fat, butter, cream, sugar, pastry, rice, sago, tapioca, corn starch, potatoes, carrots, beets, parsnips, and sweet wines.</p><p>When Quinine Will Break Up a Cold.</p><p>It is surprising, says a family physician, how certainly a cold may be broken up by a timely dose of quinine. When first symptoms make their appearance, when a little languor, slight hoarseness and ominous tightening of the nasal membranes follow exposure to draughts or sudden chill by wet, five grains of this useful alkaloid are sufficient in many cases to end the trouble. But it must be done promptly. If the golden moment passes, nothing suffices to stop the weary sneezing, handkerchief-using, red-nose and woe begone looking periods that certainly follow.</p><p>A Mistaken Idea.</p><p>The old adage. &quot;Feed a cold and starve a fever.&quot; is characterized by the Journal of Health as very silly advice. If anything, the reverse would be nearer right. When a person has a severe cold it is best for him to eat very lightly, especially during the first few days of the attack.</p><p>Hints on Bathing.</p><p>There has been a great deal written about bathing. The surface of the skin is punctured with millions of little holes called pores. The duty of these pores is to carry the waste matter off. For instance, perspiration. Now, if these pores are stopped up they are of no use, and the body has to find some other way to get rid of its impurities. Then the liver has more than it can do. Then we take a liver pill when we ought to clean out the pores instead. The housewife is very particular to keep her sieves in good order; after she has strained a substance through them they are washed out carefully with water, because water is the best thing known. That is the reason water is used to bathe in. But the skin is a little different from a sieve, because it is willing to help along the process itself. All it needs is a little encouragement and it will accomplish wonders. What the skin wants is rubbing. If you should quietly sit down in a tub of water and as quietly get up and dry off without rubbing, your skin wouldn&#39;t be much benefited. The water would make it a little soft, especially if it was warm. But rubbing is the great thing. Stand where the sunlight strikes a part of your body, then take a dry brush and rub it, and you will notice that countless little flakes of cuticle fly off. Every time one of these flakes is removed from the skin your body breathes a sigh of relief. An eminent German authority contends that too much bathing is a bad thing. There is much truth in this. Soap and water are good things to soften up the skin, but rubbing is what the skin wants. Every morning or every evening, or when it is most convenient, wash the body all over with water and a little ammonia, or anything which tends to make the water soft; then rub dry with a towel, and after that go over the body from top to toe with a dry brush. Try this for two or three weeks, and your skin will be like velvet.</p><p>Tea and Coffee.</p><p>Tea is a nerve stimulant, pure and simple, acting like alcohol in this respect, without any value that the latter may possess as a retarder of waste. It has a special influence upon those nerve centers that supply will power, exalting their sensibility beyond normal activity, and may even produce hysterical symptoms, if carried far enough. Its active principle, theine, is an exceedingly powerful drug, chiefly employed by nerve specialists as a pain destroyer, possessing the singular quality of working toward the surface. That is to say, when a dose is administered hypodermically for sciatica, for example, the narcotic influence proceeds outward from the point of injection, instead of inward toward the centers, as does that of morphia, atropia, etc. Tea is totally devoid of nutritive value, and the habit of drinking it to excess, which so many American women indulge in, particularly in the country, is to be deplored as a cause of our American nervousness. Coffee, on the contrary, is a nerve food. Like other concentrated foods of its class, it operates as a stimulant also, but upon a different set of nerves from tea. Taken strong in the morning, it often produces dizziness and that peculiar visual symptom of overstimulus which is called muscae volilantes--dancing flies. But this is an improper way to take it, and rightly used it is perhaps the most valuable liquid addition to the morning meal. Its active principle, caffeine, differs in all physiological respects from theine, while it is chemically very closely allied, and its limited consumption makes it impotent for harm.</p><p>To Straighten Round Shoulders.</p><p>A stooping figure and a halting gait, accompanied by the unavoidable weakness of lungs incidental to a narrow chest, may be entirely cured by the very simple and easily-performed exercise of raising one&#39;s self upon the toes leisurely in a perpendicular position several times daily. To take this exercise properly one must take a perfectly upright position. With the heels together and the toes at an angle of forty-five degrees. Then drop the arms lifelessly by the sides, animating and raising the chest to its full capacity and muscularity, the chin well drawn in, and the crown of the head feeling as if attached to a string suspended from the ceiling above. Slowly rise upon the balls of both feet to the greatest possible height, thereby exercising all the muscles of the legs and body; come again into standing position without swaying the body backward out of the perfect line. Repeat this same exercise, first on one foot, then on the other. It is wonderful what a straightening-out power this exercise has upon round shoulders and crooked backs, and one will be surprised to note how soon the lungs begin to show the effect of such expansive development.</p><p>Care of the Eyes.</p><p>In consequence of the increase of affections of the eye, a specialist has recently formulated the following rules to be observed in the care of the eyes for school work: A comfortable temperature, dry and warm feet, good ventilation; clothing at the neck and on other parts of the body loose; posture erect, and never read lying down or stooping. Little study before breakfast or directly after a heavy meal; none at all at twilight or late at night; use great caution about studying after recovery from fevers; have light abundant, but not dazzling, not allowing the sun to shine on desks or on objects in front of the scholars, and letting the light come from the left hand or left and rear; hold book at right angles to the line of sight or nearly so; give eyes frequent rest by looking up. The distance of the book from the eye should be about fifteen inches. The usual indication of strain is redness of the rim of the eyelid, betokening a congested state of the inner surface, which may be accompanied with some pain. When the eye tires easily rest is not the proper remedy, but the use of glasses of sufficient power to aid in accommodating the eye to vision.</p><p>How and When to Drink Water.</p><p>According to Doctor Leuf, when water is taken into the full or partly full stomach, it does not mingle with the food, as we are taught, but passes along quickly between the food and lesser curvature toward the pylorus, through which it passes into the intestines. The secretion of mucus by the lining membrane is constant, and during the night a considerable amount accumulates in the stomach; some of its liquid portion is absorbed, and that which remains is thick and tenacious. If food is taken into the stomach when in this condition, it becomes coated with this mucus, and the secretion of the gastric juice and its action are delayed. These facts show the value of a goblet of water before breakfast. This washes out the tenacious mucus, and stimulates the gastric glands to secretion. In old and feeble persons water should not be taken cold, but it may be with great advantage taken warm or hot. This removal of the accumulated mucus from the stomach is probably one of the reasons why taking soup at the beginning of a meal has been found so beneficial.</p><p>What Causes Coughs.</p><p>Cold and coughs are prevalent throughout the country, but throat affections are by far more common among business men. Every unfortunate one mutters something about the abominable weather and curses the piercing wind. Much of the trouble, however, is caused by overheated rooms, and a little more attention to proper ventilation would remove the cause of suffering. Doctor J. Ewing Mears, who was thus afflicted, said to an inquirer: &quot;The huskiness and loss of power of articulation so common among us are largely due to the use of steam for heating. The steam cannot be properly regulated, and the temperature becomes too high. A person living in this atmosphere has all the cells of the lungs open, and when he passes into the open air he is unduly exposed. The affliction is quite common among the men who occupy offices in the new buildings which are fitted up with all modern improvements. The substitution of electric light for gas has wrought a change to which people have not yet adapted themselves. The heat arising from a number of gas jets will quickly raise the temperature of a room, and unconsciously people rely upon that means of heating to some extent. Very little warmth, however, is produced by the electric light, and when a man reads by an incandescent light he at times finds himself becoming chilly, and wonders why it is. Too hot during the day and too cold at night are conditions which should be avoided.&quot;</p><p>PHYSICAL EXERCISE.</p><p>The principal methods of developing the physique now prescribed by trainers are exercise with dumbbells, the bar bell and the chest weight. The rings and horizontal and parallel bars are also used, but not nearly to the extent that they formerly were. The movement has been all in the direction of the simplification of apparatus; in fact, one well-known teacher of the Boston Gymnasium when asked his opinion said: &quot;Four bare walls and a floor, with a well-posted instructor, is all that is really required for a gymnasium.&quot;</p><p>Probably the most important as well as the simplest appliance for gymnasium work is the wooden dumbbell, which has displaced the ponderous iron bell of former days. Its weight is from three-quarters of a pound to a pound and a half, and with one in each hand a variety of motions can be gone through, which are of immense benefit in building up or toning down every muscle and all vital parts of the body.</p><p>The first object of an instructor in taking a beginner in hand is to increase the circulation. This is done by exercising the extremities, the first movement being one of the hands, after which come the wrists, then the arms, and next the head and feet. As the circulation is increased the necessity for a larger supply of oxygen, technically called &quot;oxygen-hunger,&quot; is created, which is only satisfied by breathing exercises, which develop the lungs. After the circulation is in a satisfactory condition, the dumbbell instructor turns his attention to exercising the great muscles of the body, beginning with those of the back, strengthening which holds the body erect, thus increasing the chest capacity, invigorating the digestive organs, and, in fact, all the vital functions. By the use of very light weights an equal and symmetrical development of all parts of the body is obtained, and then there are no sudden demands on the heart and lungs.</p><p>After the dumbbell comes exercise with the round, or bar bell. This is like the dumbbell, with the exception that the bar connecting the balls is four or five feet, instead of a few inches in length. Bar bells weigh from one to two pounds each and are found most useful in building up the respiratory and digestive systems, their especial province being the strengthening of the erector muscles and increasing the flexibility of the chest.</p><p>Of all fixed apparatus in use the pulley weight stands easily first in importance. These weights are available for a greater variety of objects than any other gymnastic appliance, and can be used either for general exercise or for strengthening such muscles as most require it. With them a greater localization is possible than with the dumbbell, and for this reason they are recommended as a kind of supplement to the latter. As chest developers and correctors of round shoulders they are most effective. As the name implies, they are simply weights attached to ropes, which pass over pulleys, and are provided with handles. The common pulley is placed at about the height of the shoulder of an average man, but recently those which can be adjusted to any desired height have been very generally introduced.</p><p>When more special localization is desired than can be obtained by means of the ordinary apparatus, what is known as the double-action chest weight is used. This differs from the ordinary kind in being provided with several pulleys, so that the strain may come at different angles. Double-action weights may be divided into three classes--high, low, and side pulleys--each with its particular use.</p><p>The highest of all, known as the giant pulleys, are made especially for developing the muscles of the back and chest, and by stretching or elongating movements to increase the interior capacity of the chest. If the front of the chest is full and the back or side chest deficient, the pupil is set to work on the giant pulley. To build up the side-walls he stands with the back to the pulley-box and the left heel resting against it; the handle is grasped in the right hand if the right side of the chest is lacking in development, and then drawn straight down by the side; a step forward with the right foot, as long as possible, is taken, the line brought as far to the front and near the floor as can be done, and then the arm, held stiff, allowed to be drawn solely up by the weight. To exercise the left side the same process is gone through with, the handle grasped in the left hand. Another kind of giant pulley is that which allows the operator to stand directly under it, and is used for increasing the lateral diameter of the chest. The handles are drawn straight down by the sides, the arms are then spread and drawn back by the weights. Generally speaking, high pulleys are most used for correcting high, round shoulders; low pulleys for low, round shoulders; side pulleys for individual high or low shoulders, and giant pulleys for the development of the walls of the chest and to correct spinal curvature.</p><p>The traveling rings, a line of iron rings, covered with rubber and attached to long ropes fastened to the ceiling some ten feet apart, are also valuable in developing the muscles of the back, arms and sides. The first ring is grasped in one hand and a spring taken from an elevated platform. The momentum carries the gymnast to the next ring, which is seized with the free hand, and so the entire length of the line is traversed. The parallel bars, low and high, the flying rings, the horizontal bar and the trapeze all have their uses, but of late years they have been relegated to a position of distinct inferiority to that now occupied by the dumbbells and pulley weights.</p><p>ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES.</p><p>What To Do</p><p>If an artery is cut, red blood spurts. Compress it above the wound. If a vein is cut, dark blood flows. Compress it below and above.</p><p>If choked, go upon all fours and cough.</p><p>For slight burns, dip the part in cold water; if the skin is destroyed, cover with varnish or linseed oil.</p><p>For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, lay the person flat.</p><p>Send for a physician when a serious accident of any kind occurs, but treat as directed until he arrives.</p><p>Scalds and Burns--The following facts cannot be too firmly impressed on the mind of the reader, that in either of these accidents the first, best, and often the only remedies required, are sheets of wadding, fine wool, or carded cotton, and, in the default of these, violet powder, flour, magnesia, or chalk. The object for which these several articles are employed is the same in each instance; namely, to exclude the air from the injured part; for if the air can be effectually shut out from the raw surface, and care is taken not to expose the tender part till the new cuticle is formed, the cure may be safely left to nature. The moment a person is called to a case of scald or burn, he should cover the part with a sheet, or a portion of a sheet, of wadding, taking care not to break any blister that may have formed, or stay to remove any burnt clothes that may adhere to the surface, but as quickly as possible envelop every part of the injury from all access of the air, laying one or two more pieces of wadding on the first, so as effectually to guard the burn or scald from the irritation of the atmosphere; and if the article used is wool or cotton, the same precaution, of adding more material where the surface is thinly covered, must be adopted; a light bandage finally securing all in their places. Any of the popular remedies recommended below may be employed when neither wool, cotton, nor wadding are to be procured, it being always remembered that that article which will best exclude the air from a burn or scald is the best, quickest, and least painful mode of treatment. And in this respect nothing has surpassed cotton loose or attached to paper as in wadding.</p><p>If the Skin is Much Injured in burns, spread some linen pretty thickly with chalk ointment, and lay over the part, and give the patient some brandy and water if much exhausted; then send for a medical man. If not much injured, and very painful, use the same ointment, or apply carded cotton dipped in lime water and linseed oil. If you please, you may lay cloths dipped in ether over the parts, or cold lotions. Treat scalds in same manner, or cover with scraped raw potato; but the chalk ointment is the best. In the absence of all these, cover the injured part with treacle, and dust over it plenty of flour.</p><p>BODY IN FLAMES--Lay the person down on the floor of the room, and throw the table cloth, rug, or other large cloth over him, and roll him on the floor.</p><p>DIRT IN THE EYE--Place your forefinger upon the cheek-bone, having the patient before you; then slightly bend the finger, this will draw down the lower lid of the eye, and you will probably be able to remove the dirt; but if this will not enable you to get at it, repeat this operation while you have a knitting-needle or bodkin placed over the eyelid; this will turn it inside out, and enable you to remove the sand, or eyelash, etc., with the corner of a fine silk handkerchief. As soon as the substance is removed, bathe the eye with cold water, and exclude the light for a day. If the inflammation is severe, let the patient use a refrigerant lotion.</p><p>LIME IN THE EVE--Syringe it well with warm vinegar and water in the proportion of one ounce of vinegar to eight ounces of water; exclude light.</p><p>IRON OR STEEL SPICULAE IN THE EYE--These occur while turning iron or steel in a lathe, and are best remedied by doubling back the upper or lower eyelid according to the situation of the substance, and with the flat edge of a silver probe, taking up the metallic particle, using a lotion made by dissolving six grains of sugar of lead and the same of white vitriol, in six ounces of water, and bathing the eye three times a day till the inflammation subsides. Another plan is--Drop a solution of sulphate of copper (from one to three grains of salt to one ounce of water) into the eye, or keep the eye open in a wineglassful of the solution. Bathe with cold lotion, and exclude light to keep down inflammation.</p><p>DISLOCATED THUMB--This is frequently produced by a fall. Make a clove hitch, by passing two loops of cord over the thumb, placing a piece of rag under the cord to prevent it cutting the thumb; then pull in the same line as the thumb. Afterwards apply a cold lotion.</p><p>CUTS AND WOUNDS--Clean cut wounds whether deep or superficial, and likely to heal by the first intention, should always be washed or cleaned, and at once evenly and smoothly closed by bringing both edges close together and securing them in that position by adhesive plaster. Cut thin strips of sticking plaster, and bring the parts together; or, if large and deep, cut two broad pieces, so as to look like the teeth of a comb, and place one on each side of the wound, which must be cleaned previously. These pieces must be arranged so that they shall interlace one another; then, by laying hold of the pieces on the right side with one hand, and those on the other side with the other hand and pulling them from one another, the edges of the wounds are brought together without any difficulty.</p><p>Ordinary Cuts are dressed by thin strips, applied by pressing down the plaster on one side of the wound, and keeping it there, and pulling in the opposite direction; then suddenly depressing the hand when the edges of the wound are brought together.</p><p>CONTUSIONS are best healed by laying a piece of folded lint, well wetted with extract of lead or boracic acid, on the part, and, if there is much pain, placing a hot bran poultice over the dressing, repeating both if necessary every, two hours. When the injuries are very severe lay a cloth over the part, and suspend a basin over it filled with cold lotion. Put a piece of cotton into the basin, so that it shall allow the lotion to drop on the cloth, and thus keep it always wet.</p><p>HEMORRHAGE, when caused by an artery being divided or torn, may be known by the blood issuing out of the wound in leaps or jerks, and being of a bright scarlet color. If a vein is injured, the blood is darker and flows continuously. To arrest the latter apply pressure by means of a compress and bandage. To arrest arterial bleeding, get a piece of wood (part of a broom handle will do), and tie a piece of tape to one end of it. Then tie a piece of tape loosely over the arm, and pass the other end of the wood under it; twist the stick around and around until the tape compresses the arm sufficiently to arrest the bleeding, and then confine the other end by tying the string around the arm. A compress made by enfolding a penny piece in several folds of lint or linen should, however, be first placed under the tape and over the artery, If the bleeding is very obstinate, and it occurs in the arm, place a cork underneath the string, on the inside of the fleshy part, where the artery may be felt beating by any one; if in the leg, place a cork in the direction of a line drawn from the inner part of the knee toward the outer part of the groin. It is an excellent thing to accustom yourself to find out the position of these arteries, or, indeed, any that are superficial, and to explain to every person in your house where they are, and how to stop bleeding. If a stick cannot be got, take a handkerchief, make a cord bandage of it, and tie a knot in the middle; the knot acts as a compress, and should be placed over the artery, while the two ends are c around the thumb. Observe always to place the ligature between the wound and the heart. Putting your finger into a bleeding wound, and making pressure until a surgeon arrives, will generally stop violent bleeding.</p><p>BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE, from whatever cause, may generally be stopped by putting a plug of lint into the nostrils; if this does not do, apply a cold lotion to the forehead; raise the head, and place over it both arms, so that it will rest on the hands; dip the lint plug, slightly moistened, into some powdered gum arabic, and plug the nostrils again; or dip the plug into equal parts of powdered gum arabic and alum, and plug the nose. Or the plug may be dipped in Friar&#39;s balsam, or tincture of kino. Heat should be applied to the feet; and, in obstinate cases, the sudden shock of a cold key, or cold water poured down the spine, will often instantly stop the bleeding. If the bowels are confined, take a purgative. Injections of alum solution from a small syringe into the nose will often stop hemorrhage.</p><p>VIOLENT SHOCKS will sometimes stun a person, and he will remain unconscious. Untie strings, collars, etc.; loosen anything that is tight and interferes with the breathing; raise the head; see if there is bleeding from any part; apply smelling-salts to the nose, and hot bottles to the feet.</p><p>IN CONCUSSION, the surface of the body is cold and pale, and the pulse weak and small, the breathing slow and gentle, and the pupil of the eye generally contracted or small. You can get an answer by speaking loud, so as to arouse the patient. Give a little brandy and water, keep the place quiet, apply warmth, and do not raise the head too high. If you tickle the feet, the patient feels it.</p><p>IN COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN from any cause, such as apoplexy, or a piece of fractured bone pressing on it, there is loss of sensation. If you tickle the feet of the injured person he does not feel it. You cannot arouse him so as to get an answer. The pulse is slow and labored; the breathing deep, labored, and snorting; the pupil enlarged. Raise the head, loosen strings or tight things, and send for a surgeon. If one cannot be got at once, apply mustard poultices to the feet and thighs, leeches to the temples, and hot water to the feet.</p><p>CHOKING--When a person has a fish bone in the throat, insert the forefinger, press upon the root of the tongue, so as to induce vomiting; if this does not do, let him swallow a large piece of potato or soft bread; and if these fail, give a mustard emetic,</p><p>FAINTING, HYSTERICS, ETC.--Loosen the garments, bathe the temples with water or eau-de-Cologne; open the window, admit plenty of fresh air, dash cold water on the face, apply hot bricks to the feet, and avoid bustle and excessive sympathy.</p><p>DROWNING.--Attend to the following essential rules: 1. Lose no time. 2. Handle the body gently. 3. Carry the body face downward, with the head gently raised, and never hold it up by the feet. 4. Send for medical assistance immediately, and in the meantime act as follows: 5. Strip the body; rub it dry, then wrap it in hot blankets, and place it in a warm bed in a warm room. 6. Cleanse away the froth and mucus from the nose and month. 7. Apply warm bricks, bottles, bags of sand, etc. to the armpits, between the thighs, and to the soles of the feet. 8. Rub the surface of the body with the hands inclosed in warm, dry worsted socks. 9. If possible, put the body into a warm bath. 10. To restore breathing, put the pipe of a common bellows into one nostril, carefully closing the other, and the mouth; at the same time drawing downward, and pushing gently backward, the upper part of the windpipe to allow a more free admission of air; blow the bellows gently, in order to inflate the lungs, till the breast be raised a little; then set the month and nostrils free, and press gently on the chest; repeat this until signs of life appear. The body should be covered the moment it is placed on the table, except the face, and all the rubbing carried on under the sheet or blanket. When they can be obtained, a number of tiles or bricks should be made tolerably hot in the fire, laid in a row on the table, covered with a blanket, and the body placed in such a manner on them that their heat may enter the spine. When the patient revives, apply smelling-salts to the nose, give warm wine or brandy and water. Cautions.--1. Never rub the body with salt or spirits. 2. Never roll the body on casks. 3. Continue the remedies for twelve hours without ceasing.</p><p>HANGING--Loosen the cord, or whatever it may be by which the person has been suspended. Open the temporal artery or jugular vein, or bleed from the arm; employ electricity, if at hand, and proceed as for drowning.</p><p>APPARENT DEATH FROM DRUNKENNESS--Raise the head; loosen the clothes, maintain warmth of surface, and give a mustard emetic as soon as the person can swallow.</p><p>APOPLEXY AND FITS GENERALLY--Raise the head; loosen all tight clothes, strings, etc.; apply cold lotions to the head, and send for a surgeon.</p><p>SUFFOCATION FROM NOXIOUS GASES, ETC.--Remove to the fresh air; dash cold vinegar and water in the face, neck, and breast; keep up the warmth of the body; if necessary, apply mustard poultices to the soles of the feet and to the spine, and try artificial respirations as in drowning, with electricity.</p><p>LIGHTNING AND SUNSTROKE--Treat the same as apoplexy.</p><p>POISONS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES.</p><p>General Rules</p><p>Always send immediately for a medical man. Save all fluids vomited, and articles of food, cups, glasses, etc., used by the patient before taken ill, and lock them up.</p><p>As a rule give emetics after poisons that cause sleepiness and raving; chalk, milk, eggs, butter, and warm water, or oil, after poisons that cause vomiting and pain in the stomach and bowels, with purging; and when there is no inflammation about the throat, tickle it with a feather to excite vomiting.</p><p>Vomiting may be caused by giving warm water, with a teaspoonful of mustard to the tumblerful, well stirred up. Sulphate of zinc (white vitriol) may be used in place of the mustard, or powdered alum. Powder of ipecacuanha, a teaspoonful rubbed up with molasses, may be employed for children. Tartar emetic should never be given, as it is excessively depressing, and uncontrollable in its effects. The stomach pump can only be used by skillful hands, and even then with caution.</p><p>Opium and other Narcotics--After vomiting has occurred, cold water should be dashed over the face and head. The patient must be kept awake, walked about between two strong persons, made to grasp the handles of a galvanic battery, dosed with strong coffee, and vigorously slapped. Belladonna is an antidote for opium and for morphia, etc.; its active principles; and, on the other hand, the latter counteract the effects of belladonna. But a knowledge of medicine is necessary for dealing with these articles.</p><p>Strychnia--After emetics have been freely and successfully given, the patient should be allowed to breathe the vapor of sulphuric ether, poured on a handkerchief and held to the face, in such quantities as to keep down the tendency to convulsions. Bromide of potassium, twenty grains at a dose, dissolved in syrup, may be given every hour.</p><p>Alcoholic Poisoning should be combated by emetics, of which the sulphate of zinc, given as above directed, is the best. After that, strong coffee internally, and stimulation by heat externally, should be used.</p><p>Acids are sometimes swallowed by mistake. Alkalies, lime water, magnesia, or common chalk mixed with water, may be freely given, and afterward mucilaginous drinks, such as thick gum water or flaxseed tea.</p><p>Alkalies are less frequently taken in injurious strength or quantity, but sometimes children swallow lye by mistake. Common vinegar may be given freely, and then castor or sweet oil in full doses--a tablespoonful at a time, repeated every half hour or two.</p><p>Nitrate of silver when swallowed is neutralized by common table salt freely given in solution in water.</p><p>The salts of mercury or arsenic (often kept as bedbug poison), which are powerful irritants, are apt to be very quickly fatal. Milk or the whites of eggs may be freely given and afterward a very thin paste of flour and water. In these cases an emetic is to be given after the poison is neutralized.</p><p>Phosphorus paste, kept for roach poison or in parlor matches, is sometimes eaten by children and has been willfully taken for the purpose of suicide. It is a powerful irritant. The first thing to be done is to give freely of magnesia and water; then to give mucilaginous drinks as flaxseed tea, gum water or sassafras pith and water; and lastly to administer finely powdered bone-charcoal, either in pill or in mixture with water.</p><p>In no case of poisoning should there be any avoidable delay in obtaining the advice of a physician, and, meanwhile, the friends or bystanders should endeavor to find out exactly what has been taken, so that the treatment adopted may be as prompt and effective as possible.</p><p>KEEP STILL.</p><p>Keep still. When trouble is brewing, keep still. Even when slander is getting on its legs, keep still. When your feelings are hurt, keep still, till you recover from your excitement at any rate. Things look differently through an unagitated eye. A doctor relates how once in a commotion he wrote a letter, and sent it, and wished he had not. &quot;I had another commotion and wrote a long letter; but life had rubbed a little sense into me. I kept that letter in my pocket against the day when I could look it over without agitation and without tears. I was glad I did. Less and less it seemed necessary to send it I was not sure it would do any hurt, but in my doubt I leaned to reticence, and eventually it was destroyed.&quot;</p><p>PHILOSOPHICAL FACTS.</p><p>The greatest height at which visible clouds ever exist does not exceed ten miles.</p><p>Air is about eight hundred and fifteen times lighter than water.</p><p>The pressure of the atmosphere upon every square foot of the earth amounts to two thousand one hundred and sixty pounds.</p><p>The violence of the expansion of water when freezing is sufficient to cleave a globe of copper of such thickness as to require a force of 27,000 pounds, to produce the same effect.</p><p>During the conversion of ice into water one hundred and forty degrees of heat are absorbed.</p><p>Water, when converted into steam, increases in bulk eighteen hundred times.</p><p>In one second of time--in one beat of the pendulum of a clock--light travels two hundred thousand miles.

One of the most remarkable of all natural phenomena is the FAMOUS WELLS OF ABILENA from which flows a perfect laxative water.</p><p>Scientists of today, with the accumulated knowledge of 1,000 years to guide them, have not been able to manufacture a harmless, non-irritating laxative which relieves constipation and stimulates the liver as AbilenA Water does.</p><p>You will never need laxative medicines of any kind--pills, tablets, capsules, salts, artificial waters--if you occasionally drink a wine-glass of AbilenA when conditions call for a laxative or cathartic.</p><p>AbilenA comes to you pure--just as it flows from the Famous Wells of AbilenA--harmless as the water you drink--clear, sparkling, vitalizing. It flushes and cleanses the system thoroughly, and in the gentlest way possible. Instead of irritating the delicate membranes of the stomach and bowels, as drugs and artificial waters are very apt to do, it relieves congestions and soothes these membranes, and it stimulates liver activities.</p><p>There is no magic in the name, AbilenA, nor no special virtue simply because it happens to be America&#39;s only natural cathartic water, but its splendid clinical value and effect is due solely to the fact that AbilenA is almost wholly pure and true Sodium Sulphate--the world&#39;s truest representative of this ideal laxative and reconstructive base, All the other waters on the markets are largely solutions of Epsom salts, consequently are nauseous, harsh and irritating. The same thing is more or less true with pills, powders and the manufactured cathartics.</p><p>AbilenA is a safe, sure, inexpensive laxative and cathartic, convenient and pleasant to take, suited for old and young alike, a cure for constipation and biliousness, and truly the ideal family remedy.</p><p>AbilenA is America&#39;s Only Bottled Natural Cathartic Water.</p><p>We will mail, free, upon application, &quot;The Natural Method,&quot; an interesting booklet on the importance of normal elimination and a study of the comparative values of the better known cathartics.</p><p>THE ABILENA COMPANY Frank M.

Yes--that&#39;s just it--a real one at last--one that invigorates the roots and promotes the restoration of the hair to its original beauty, luxuriance and color.</p><p>Better than any argument is the Restorative itself--for you to try. We are only too glad to throw ourselves wholly on the merits of Golden Rule Hair Restorative, so we years ago set aside thousands of dollars to spend on big free Sample bottles.</p><p>If we didn&#39;t know what our preparation would do this would be reckless extravagance. But we do know and believe that the quickest way to help you to find it out is to place a bottle of it in your bands.</p><p>We know the annoyance of having one&#39;s hair fall and turn gray, perhaps while you are still young. It is the result perhaps of some unusual worry or care, but that does not prevent friends and neighbors from the knowing nod that says, &quot;Growing old.&quot;</p><p>Not so, it is only a run down condition of the roots of the hair--just as the body gets run down. But you should not permit this. It is not necessary and this needless look of age impairs your usefulness and popularity in society and business.</p><p>Golden Rule Hair Restorative simply invigorates the roots--waking them up--toning them up--rejuvenating them until they are rendered lively and vigorous as in youth, The obvious result is that the growth of the hair is promoted. Hair can starve and wither like any plant that gets its life from its roots. If the roots are vigorous and healthy, the hair is bound to be natural.</p><p>We want you to accept a large sample bottle with our compliments.</p><p>We want you to know what a remarkable remedy this is. If you don&#39;t need it yourself, get it for some friend. The truth is, however, that everyone should use Golden Rule Hair Restorative as a dressing for the Hair to keep it healthy, just as you use a dentrifice to keep the teeth dainty and healthy.</p><p>Get this bottle and try it. Remember its continued use tends to stop hair from falling by promoting a vigorous growth of healthy hair. Remember that it restores color to the hair. It is harmless and a trial will convince you that it is just what we claim for it.

After several fillings, it is better to sweeten the water with a teaspoonful of sugar before putting it in the Daisy.</p><p>Daisy Fly Killer placed anywhere attracts and kills all flies.

MARTELS FEMALE PILLS 18 YEARS THE STANDARD</p><p>A scientifically Prepared Remedy (For Disturbances of the Menstrual Functions) Sold Only Through the Medical and Drug Profession; for Medical Purposes Only.</p><p>A FEW REMARKS OF IMPORTANCE TO WOMANKIND</p><p>Dr. Martel&#39;s Female Pills is a preparation of unequaled excellence, which acts as a positive tonic on the female reproductive organs, and imparts to them the proper functional action nature demands in normal, healthy women, without untoward action. Dr. Martel&#39;s Female Pills possess only virtues of the highest possible value. It re-establishes the proper action of the generative organs by restoring their vitality, and not by merely stimulating them excessively (and temporarily), as do so many other agents of this class.</p><p>In the treatment of all disturbances of the menstrual functions arising from debility, anemia or nervousness, Dr. Martel&#39;s Female Pills are of unsurpassed value. This preparation is a uterine and ovarian sedative, and is of special service in treating congestive and inflammatory conditions of these organs which are accompanied with unusual pain.</p><p>Amenorrhea.--When the menstrual flow is scanty or suppressed, as a result of sudden exposure to cold, worry, fright, grief or other violent mental shocks.</p><p>Menorrhagia.--Profuse menstruation is at once relieved by Dr. Martel&#39;s Pills. The preparation instantly restores vigor to the uterus which has been lost through the excessive flow of blood. It is advisable to begin the use of the preparation a few days in advance of the flow in those cases which are disposed to menstruate profusely at each visitation.</p><p>Menopause.--The nervous and mental disturbances which frequently precede and succeed the final cessation of ovulation and menstruation respond readily to the anti-spasmodic and tranquilizing action of Dr. Martel&#39;s Pills. Where hysteria, melancholia, moroseness and despondency are conspicuous factors, the preparation can be used to great advantage. The improvement in the mental state of the patient after the administration of this product is always durable and pronounced.</p><p>Dysmenorrhea.--In the treatment of congestive, neuralgic, mechanical or membranous types of dysmenorrhea, the action of Dr. Martel&#39;s Pills is particularly gratifying.</p><p>THIS PREPARATION IS OF PARTICULAR VALUE IN THE TREATMENT OF MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES FROM ANY CAUSE, AS ABOVE STATED, WHICH FAIL TO RESPOND TO OTHER AND ORDINARY MEDICAL REMEDIES.</p><p>It is a well known, and scientifically proven fact, that all women are not constitutionally or temperamentally alike. Where some respond readily to one mode of treatment others do not. For this reason we have prepared a preparation designed for such instances. This remedy is Dr. Martel&#39;s Special Female Pills. $5.00 Box.</p><p>SOLD BY ALL DRUGGISTS</p><hr><p>Nervous? Suffer From Indigestion, Irregular Kidneys, Bowel Trouble, Appendicitis, Gall Stones--Here Is Relief</p><p>When your head aches; when your breath is bad; when your bowels or kidneys are irregular; when your appetite fails or the twinges of indigestion make you regret each meal; when your nervous system has gone to pieces--then is your stomach sending its wireless message for help.</p><p>The trouble may be in the stomach itself--indigestion--dyspepsia, and their nightmare evils.</p><p>The intestinal tract may be deranged or the liver clogged, or it may be gall stones. Your case may not have reached the gall stone stage. It may be of a different nature--threatened appendicitis, for example. In any case, whether it be bad stomach, torpid liver or weakened and inflamed bowels--the answer to that wireless should be Fruitola and Traxo.</p><p>These are two remarkable preparations used in combination, which for the past 20 years and more have released thousands from the pangs of dyspepsia and have saved as many from operations for gall stones and appendicitis.</p><p>Fruitola cleanses, lubricates and soothes all the channels of the digestive system, without the least pain, griping or resulting weakness. It is nutritive in effect. It revives the appetite, clears the way for perfect digestion and thorough assimilation, allows Nature to make pure blood, firm flesh, strong muscles, healthy tissue and store up vital energy. A whole bottle of Fruitola is to be taken at once; this to be followed by small doses of Traxo to complete the strengthening and toning effect on the stomach, to insure regular, natural action of bowels and kidneys and to give permanence to all the benefits of the treatment. The gentle action of Traxo on the kidneys removes waste and by keeping the liver active it frees the general circulation of bile--it clears the eye and complexion and brings the glow of health to the cheeks.</p><p>Pinus, the great rheumatism remedy, has saved thousands of sufferers after long years of agonizing attacks. Joints swollen and misshapen by Inflammatory Rheumatism, nerves and muscles overpowered by the intense misery of Chronic Rheumatism and Sciatica have been restored to health and strength--pain and swelling banished by the marvelous properties of Pinus, a product of California&#39;s wonderful soil and sun.</p><p>Fruitola, Traxo and Pinus are guaranteed under the Pure Food and Drugs Act. They are entirely vegetable and there is not a single ingredient that can harm the most sensitive system when taken as directed. They are made from the natural products of California, the land of health and sunshine.</p><p>Stop your suffering and suspense at once. Get the most wonderful remedies from your druggist today.
