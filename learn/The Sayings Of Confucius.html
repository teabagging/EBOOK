</code></pre><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Confucius was born in the year 550 B.C.,[1] in the land of Lu, in a small village, situated in the western part of the modern province of Shantung. His name was K&#39;ung Ch&#39;iu, and his style (corresponding to our Christian name) was Chung-ni. His countrymen speak of him as K&#39;ung Fu-tzu, the Master, or philosopher K&#39;ung. This expression was altered into Confucius by the Jesuit missionaries who first carried his fame to Europe.</p><p>[Footnote 1: According to the great historian Ssu-ma Ch&#39;ien. Other authorities say, 552 and 551 B.C.]</p><p>Since the golden days of the Emperors Yao and Shun, the legendary founders of the Chinese Empire, nearly two thousand years had passed. Shun chose as his successor Yue, who had been his chief minister, a man whose devotion to duty was such that when engaged in draining the empire of the great flood--a task that took eight years to accomplish--he never entered his home till the work was done, although in the course of his labours he had thrice to pass his door. He founded the Hsia dynasty, which lasted till 1766 B.C. The last emperor of this line, a vile tyrant, was overthrown by T&#39;ang, who became the first ruler of the house of Shang, or Yin. This dynasty again degenerated in course of time and came to an end in Chou, or Chou Hsin (1154-22 B.C.), a monster of lust, extravagance, and cruelty. The empire was only held together by the strength and wisdom of the Duke of Chou, or King Wen, to give him his popular title, one of the greatest men in Chinese history. He controlled two-thirds of the empire; but, believing that the people were not yet ready for a change, he refrained from dethroning the emperor. In his day &#39;the husbandman paid one in nine; the pay of the officers was hereditary; men were questioned at barriers and at markets, but there were no tolls; fishgarths were not preserved; the children of criminals were sackless. The old and wifeless--the widower; the old and husbandless--the widow; the old and childless--the lone one; the young and fatherless--the orphan; these four are the people most in need below heaven, and they have no one to whom to cry, so when King Wen reigned his love went out first to them&#39; (Mencius, Book II, chapter 5). After his death, his son, King Wu, decided that the nation was ripe for change. He overcame Chou Hsin by force of arms, and, placing himself on the throne, became the founder of the Chou dynasty.</p><p>In the time of Confucius the Chou dynasty still filled the throne. But it had long since become effete, and all power had passed into the hands of the great vassals. The condition of China was much like that of Germany in the worst days of the Holy Roman Empire. The emperor was powerless, the various vassal states were independent in all but name, and often at war one with the other. These states again were disintegrated, and their rulers impotent against encroaching feudatories. In Confucius&#39; native state, Lu, the duke was a mere shadow. The younger branches of his house had usurped all power. Three in number, they were called the Three Clans. The most important of the three was the Chi, or Chi-sun clan, whose chiefs Chi Huan and Chi K&#39;ang are often mentioned by Confucius. But the power of the Chi, too, was ill-secured. The minister Yang Huo overawed his master, and once even threw him into prison. Nor was the condition of the other states of the empire better than that of Lu. Confucius thought it worse.</p><p>Into this turbulent world Confucius was born. Though his father was only a poor military officer, he could trace his descent from the imperial house of Yin. Confucius married at nineteen, and is known to have had one son and one daughter. Shortly after his marriage he entered the service of the state as keeper of the granary. A year later he was put in charge of the public fields. In 527 B.C. his mother died, and, in obedience to Chinese custom, he had to retire from public life. When the years of mourning were over, he did not again take office, but devoted himself instead to study and teaching. As the years rolled by his fame grew, and a band of pupils gathered round him. In 517 B.C. the anarchy in Lu reached such a pitch that Confucius moved to the neighbouring land of Ch&#39;i. Here he had several interviews with the reigning duke, but met with little encouragement (xviii. 3). So he soon returned to his native country, and resumed for fifteen years his work as student and teacher.</p><p>During these fifteen years the power of the duke sank lower and lower, and the Chi was menaced by his minister Yang Huo. In times so dark, men that loved quiet sought in the world of thought an escape from the gloom around them, whilst others that were less resigned turned over in their minds the causes of the realm&#39;s decay. Lao-tzu, the founder of the mystic Taoist philosophy, taught that in inaction alone peace can be found; Mo-tzu proclaimed the doctrine of universal love: that we should love all men as we love self, love the parents of others as we love our own parents. Upright men were driven or fled from the world. Confucius often met them in his wanderings, and was reproved for not doing as they did. But his practical mind told him that inaction could not help the world, and that to find a remedy for the nation&#39;s ills, their cause must first be learned. This could only be done by historical study. He therefore devoted himself to the study of past times, edited in later life the <em>Book of History</em>, and compiled the work called <em>Spring and Autumn</em>, a history of his native state from 722 to 481 B.C. To bring again the golden days of Yao and Shun a return must be made to the principles of Wen and Wu, the kings that had rebuilt the empire after tyranny and selfishness had laid it low. Of impracticable ideals and renunciation of the world no good could come.</p><p>At last in 501 B.C. Yang Huo was forced to flee from Lu, and prospects brightened. A year later Confucius was appointed governor of a town. So great was his success as governor that before long he was promoted to be Superintendent of Works, and then to be Chief Criminal Judge. He won great influence with his master, and did much to lighten the general misery. He so strengthened the power of the duke that neighbouring states grew jealous. To sow dissension between duke and minister the men of Ch&#39;i sent the duke a gift of singing girls. Such joy they gave him that for three days no court was held. On this Confucius left the land, 497 B.C.</p><p>For the next thirteen years Confucius wandered from land to land, followed by his disciples, seeking in vain for a ruler that was willing to employ him, and whom he was willing to serve. At times he was exposed to danger, at other times to want. But as a rule he was treated with consideration, although his teachings were ignored. Yet thirteen years of homeless wandering, of hopes deferred and frustrated, must have been hard to bear. When he left office Confucius was already fifty-three years old, and his life so far seemed a failure. The sense of his wasted powers may well have tempted him now and again to take office under an unworthy ruler; but knowing that no good could come of it he refrained, and probably he never seriously thought of doing so.</p><p>In 483 B.C., when Confucius was sixty-six years old, through the influence of his disciple Jan Yu, who was in the service of the Chi, the Master was invited to return to his native land. Here he remained till his death in 479 B.C. He had many interviews with the reigning duke and the head of the Chi clan, but gained no influence over either of them. So he turned once more to his favourite studies; edited the <em>Book of Poetry</em>--perhaps the most interesting collection of ancient songs extant--and wrote <em>Spring and Autumn</em>. His closing years were darkened by the loss of those dearest to him. First his son died, then Yen Yuean, the disciple whom he loved best. At his death the Master was overcome by grief, and he left none behind him that loved learning. Lastly Tzu-lu, the frank and bold, was killed in battle. A little later, in his seventy-first year, Confucius himself passed away, 479 B.C.</p><p>This book of the Master&#39;s Sayings is believed by the Chinese to have been written by the disciples of Confucius. But there is nothing to prove this, and some passages in the book point the other way. Book viii speaks of the death of Tseng-tzu, who did not die till 437 B.C., forty-two years after the Master. The chief authority for the text as it stands to-day is a manuscript found in the house of Confucius in 150 B.C., hidden there, in all likelihood, between the years 213 and 211 B.C., when the reigning emperor was seeking to destroy every copy of the classics. We find no earlier reference to the book under its present name. But Mencius (372-289 B.C.) quotes seven passages from it, in language all but identical with the present text, as the words of Confucius. No man ever talked the language of these sayings. Such pith and smoothness is only reached by a long process of rounding and polishing. We shall probably come no nearer to the truth than Legge&#39;s conclusion that the book was put together by the pupils of the disciples of Confucius, from the words and notebooks of their masters, about the year 400 B.C.</p><p>LEONARD A.

</code></pre><p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p><p>BOOK I</p><ol><li><p>The Master said, To learn and then do, is not that a pleasure? When friends come from afar do we not rejoice? To live unknown and not fret, is not that to be a gentleman?</p></li><li><p>Yu-tzu[2] said. Few men that are good sons and good brothers are fond of withstanding those over them. A man that is not fond of withstanding those over him and is yet fond of broils is nowhere found. A gentleman heeds the roots. When the root has taken, the Way is born. And to be a good son and a good brother, is not that the root of love?</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 2: A disciple.]</p><ol start="3"><li><p>The Master said, Smooth words and fawning looks are seldom found with love.</p></li><li><p>Tseng-tzu[3] said, Thrice daily I ask myself: In dealing for others, have I been unfaithful? Have I been untrue to friends? Do I practise what I preach?</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 3: A disciple.]</p><ol start="5"><li><p>The Master said, To guide a land of a thousand chariots, honour business and be true; spend little and love men; time thy calls on the people.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, The young should be dutiful at home, modest abroad, careful and true, overflowing in kindness for all, but in brotherhood with love. And if they have strength to spare they should spend it on the arts.</p></li><li><p>Tzu-hsia[3] said, If a man eschews beauty and honours worth, if he serves his father and mother with all his strength, if he is ready to give his life for his lord, and keeps faith with his friends, though others may say he has no learning, I must call him learned.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A gentleman will not be looked up to unless he is staid, nor will his learning be sound. Put faithfulness and truth first; have no friends unlike thyself; be not ashamed to mend thy faults.</p></li><li><p>Tseng-tzu[4] said, Heed the dead, follow up the past, and the soul of the people will again grow great.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 4: A disciple.]</p><ol start="10"><li>Tzu-ch&#39;in[5] said to Tzu-kung,[6] When he comes to a country the Master always hears how it is governed; does he ask, or is it told him?</li></ol><p>[Footnote 5: A disciple.]</p><p>[Footnote 6: A disciple.]</p><p>Tzu-kung said, The Master gets it by his warmth and honesty, by politeness, modesty and yielding. The way the Master asks is unlike other men&#39;s asking.</p><ol start="11"><li>The Master said, Whilst thy father lives look for his purpose; when he is gone, look how he walked. To change nothing in thy father&#39;s ways for three years may be called pious.</li></ol><p>12, Yu-tzu[7] said, To behave with ease is the best part of courtesy. This was the beauty of the old kings&#39; ways; this they followed in small and great. But knowing this, it will not do to give way to ease, unchecked by courtesy. This too is wrong.</p><p>[Footnote 7: A disciple.]</p><ol start="13"><li><p>Yu-tzu said, If pledges are close to right, word can be kept. If attentions are close to courtesy, shame will be kept far. If we do not choose our leaders wrong, we may worship them too.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A gentleman that does not seek to eat his fill, nor look for ease in his home, who is earnest at work and careful of speech, who walks with those that keep the Way, and is guided by them, may be said to love learning.</p></li><li><p>Tzu-kung[8] said, Poor, but no flatterer; rich, but not proud: how would that be?</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 8: A disciple.]</p><p>It would do, said the Master; but better still were poor but merry; rich, but loving courtesy.</p><p>Tzu-kung said, When the poem says:</p><pre><code>If ye cut, if ye file,
  If ye polish and grind,
</code></pre><p>is that what is meant?</p><p>The Master said, Now I can begin to talk of poetry to Tz&#39;u. Tell him what is gone, and he knows what shall come.</p><ol start="16"><li>The Master said, Not to be known is no sorrow. My sorrow is not knowing men.</li></ol><p>BOOK II</p><ol><li><p>The Master said, He that rules by mind is like the north star, steady in his seat, whilst the stars all bend to him.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, The three hundred poems are summed up in the one line, Think no evil.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Guide the people by law, aline them by punishment; they may shun crime, but they will want shame. Guide them by mind, aline them by courtesy; they will learn shame and grow good.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, At fifteen, I had the will to learn; at thirty, I could stand; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I understood the heavenly Bidding; at sixty, my ears were opened[9]; at seventy, I could do as my heart lusted without trespassing from the square.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 9: <em>Lit.</em>, obedient.]</p><ol start="5"><li>Meng Yi asked the duty of a son.</li></ol><p>The Master said, Not to transgress.</p><p>As Fan Chi&#39;ih[10] was driving him, the Master said, Meng-sun[11] asked me the duty of a son; I answered, Not to transgress.</p><p>[Footnote 10: A disciple.]</p><p>[Footnote 11: Meng Yi.]</p><p>What did ye mean? said Fan Chi&#39;ih.</p><p>To serve our father and mother with courtesy whilst they live; to bury them with courtesy when they die, and to worship them with courtesy.</p><ol start="6"><li>Meng Wu asked the duty of a son.</li></ol><p>The Master said, He should not grieve his father and mother by anything but illness.</p><ol start="7"><li>Tzu-yu[12] asked the duty of a son.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 12: A disciple.]</p><p>The Master said, He that can feed his parents is now called a good son. But both dogs and horses are fed, and unless we honour our parents, what is the difference?</p><ol start="8"><li>Tzu-hsia[13] asked the duty of a son.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 13: A disciple.]</p><p>The Master said, Our manner is the hard part. For the young to be a stay in toil and leave the wine and food to their elders, is this to fulfil their duty?</p><ol start="9"><li>The Master said, If I talk all day to Hui,[14] like a dullard, he never differs from me. But when he is gone, if I watch him when alone, he can carry out what I taught. No, Hui is no dullard!</li></ol><p>[Footnote 14: The disciple Yen Yuean.]</p><ol start="10"><li><p>The Master said, See what he does; watch what moves him; search what pleases him: can the man lie hidden? Can the man lie hidden?</p></li><li><p>The Master said, To keep old knowledge warm and get new makes the teacher.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A gentleman is not a vessel.</p></li><li><p>Tzu-kung[15] asked, What is a gentleman?</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 15: A disciple.]</p><p>The Master said, He puts words into deeds first, and follows these up with words.</p><ol start="14"><li><p>The Master said, A gentleman is broad and fair; the small man takes sides and is narrow.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Learning without thought is naught; thought without learning is dangerous.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, To fight strange doctrines does harm.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Yu,[16] shall I teach thee what is wisdom? To know what we know, and know what we do not know, is wisdom.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 16: The disciple Tzu-lu.]</p><ol start="18"><li>Tsu-chang[17] learned with an eye to pay.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 17: A disciple.]</p><p>The Master said, Hear much, leave all that is doubtful alone, speak warily of everything else, and few will be offended. See much, leave all that is dangerous alone, deal warily with everything else, and thou wilt have little to rue. If thy words seldom give offence, and thy deeds leave little to rue, pay will follow.</p><ol start="19"><li>Duke Ai[18] asked, What should I do to win the people?</li></ol><p>[Footnote 18: Of Lu.]</p><p>Confucius answered, Lift up the straight, put away the crooked; and the people will be won. Lift up the crooked, put away the straight; and the people will not be won.</p><ol start="20"><li>Chi K&#39;ang[19] asked how to make the people lowly, faithful and painstaking.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 19: The head of the Chi clan.]</p><p>The Master said, Meet them with dignity, they will be lowly; be a good son and merciful, they will be faithful; lift up the good and teach the unskilled, and they will take pains.</p><ol start="21"><li>One said to Confucius, Why do ye not govern, Sir?</li></ol><p>The Master said, What does the Book[20] say of a good son? &#39;To be a good son and a friend to thy brothers is to show how to govern.&#39; This, too, is to govern. Must one be in office to govern?</p><p>[Footnote 20: The Book of History.]</p><ol start="22"><li><p>The Master said, A man without truth, I know not what good he is! A cart without a crosspole, a carriage without a yoke, how can they be moved?</p></li><li><p>Tzu-chang[21] asked whether we can know what is to be ten generations hence.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 21: A disciple.]</p><p>The Master said, The Yin[22] took over the manners of the Hsia; the harm and the good that they did them can be known. The Chou took over the manners of the Yin; the harm and the good that they did them can be known. And we may know what shall be, even an hundred generations hence, whoever follows Chou.</p><p>[Footnote 22: Up to the time of Confucius, China had been ruled by three lines of kings. First the T&#39;ang, next the Yin or Shang, then the Chou.]</p><ol start="24"><li>The Master said, To worship the ghosts of men not akin to us is fawning. To see the right and not do it is want of courage.</li></ol><p>BOOK III</p><ol><li>Of the Chi having eight rows of dancers[23] in his courtyard, Confucius said, If this is to be borne, what is not to be borne?</li></ol><p>[Footnote 23: An Imperial prerogative.]</p><ol start="2"><li>When the sacrifice was ended, the Three Clans had the Yung hymn sung.</li></ol><p>The Master said,</p><pre><code>Princes and dukes assist.
Solemn is the Son of heaven;
</code></pre><p>what meaning has this in the courtyard of the Three Clans?</p><ol start="3"><li><p>The Master said, A man without love, what is courtesy to him? A man without love, what is music to him?</p></li><li><p>Lin Fang asked what good form is at root.</p></li></ol><p>The Master said, A big question! At high-tides, thrift is better than waste; at burials, grief is worth more than nicety.</p><ol start="5"><li>The Master said, Every wild tribe has its lord, whereas the lands of Hsia[24] have none!</li></ol><p>[Footnote 24: China.]</p><ol start="6"><li>The Chi sacrificed to Mount T&#39;ai.[25]</li></ol><p>[Footnote 25: A prerogative of the Duke of Lu.]</p><p>The Master said to Jan Yu,[26] Canst thou not stop this?</p><p>[Footnote 26: A disciple in the service of the Chi.]</p><p>He answered, I cannot.</p><p>Alas! said the Master; dost thou think Mount T&#39;ai less wise than Lin Fang?</p><ol start="7"><li>The Master said, A gentleman never strives with others. Or must he, perhaps, in shooting? But then, as he bows and makes way in going up or steps down to drink,[27] his strife is that of a gentleman.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 27: The loser had to drink a cup of wine.]</p><ol start="8"><li><p>Tzu-hsia asked, What is the meaning of:</p><p>Her cunning smiles, Her dimples light, Her lovely eyes, So clear and bright, All unadorned, The background white.</p></li></ol><p>Colouring, said the Master, is second to the plain ground.</p><p>Then good form is second, said Tzu-hsia.</p><p>Shang,[28] said the Master, thou hast hit my meaning! Now I can talk of poetry to thee.</p><p>[Footnote 28: Tzu-hsia.]</p><ol start="9"><li>The Master said, I can speak of the manners of Hsia; but as proof of them Chi[29] is not enough. I can speak of the manners of Yin; but as proof of them Sung is not enough. This is due to their dearth of books and great men. If there were enough of these, I could use them as proofs.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 29: Chi was the homeland of the House of Hsia, Sung that of the House of Yin.]</p><ol start="10"><li><p>The Master said, After the drink offering at the Great Sacrifice, I have no wish to see more.</p></li><li><p>One asked the meaning of the Great Sacrifice.</p></li></ol><p>The Master said, I do not know. He that knew the meaning would overlook all below heaven as I do this--and he pointed to his palm.</p><ol start="12"><li>He worshipped as if those whom he worshipped were before him; he worshipped the spirits as if they were before him.</li></ol><p>The Master said: For me, to take no part in the sacrifice is the same as not sacrificing.</p><ol start="13"><li>Wang-sun Chia[30] said, What is the meaning of, It is better to court the hearth-god than the god of the home?</li></ol><p>[Footnote 30: Wang-sun Chia was minister of Wei, and had more influence than his master. The hearth-god ranks below the god of the home (the Roman <em>lares</em>), but since he sees all that goes on in the house, and ascends to heaven at the end of the year to report what has happened, it is well to be on good terms with him.]</p><p>Not so, said the Master. A sin against Heaven leaves no room for prayer.</p><ol start="14"><li>The Master said, Chou[31] looks back on two lines of kings. How rich, how rich it is in art! I follow Chou.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 31: The royal house of Chou, which was then ruling China.]</p><ol start="15"><li>On going into the Great Temple the Master asked about everything.</li></ol><p>One said, Who says that the Tsou man&#39;s son knows the rites? On going into the Great Temple he asked about everything.</p><p>When he heard this, the Master said, Such is the rite.</p><ol start="16"><li><p>The Master said, In shooting, the arrow need not go right through the target, for men are not the same in strength. This was the old rule.</p></li><li><p>Tzu-kung wished to do away with the sheep offering at the new moon.</p></li></ol><p>The Master said, Thou lovest the sheep, Tz&#39;u: I love the rite.</p><ol start="18"><li><p>The Master said: Serve the king with all courtesy, men call it fawning.</p></li><li><p>Duke Ting asked how a lord should treat his lieges, and how lieges should serve their lord.</p></li></ol><p>Confucius answered, The lord should treat his lieges with courtesy; lieges should serve their lord faithfully.</p><ol start="20"><li><p>The Master said, The poem <em>The Osprey</em> is glad, but not wanton; it is sad, but not morbid.</p></li><li><p>Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the earth-altars.</p></li></ol><p>Tsai Wo answered, The Emperors of the house of Hsia grew firs round them; the men of Yin grew cypress; the men of Chou grew chestnut, which was to say, Let the people tremble.[32]</p><p>[Footnote 32: <em>Tremble</em> and <em>chestnut</em> have the same sound in Chinese.]</p><p>On hearing this, the Master said, I do not speak of what is ended, chide what is settled, or find fault with what is past.[33]</p><p>[Footnote 33: In old times men had been sacrificed at the earth-altars, and Tsai Wo&#39;s answer might seem to approve the practice.]</p><ol start="22"><li>The Master said, How shallow was Kuan Chung!</li></ol><p>But, said one, was not Kuan Chung thrifty?</p><p>The Kuan, said the Master, owned San Kuei, and no one of his household held two posts: was that thrift?</p><p>At least Kuan Chung knew good form.</p><p>The Master said, Kings screen their gates with trees; the Kuan, too, had trees to screen his gate. When two kings are carousing, they have a stand for the turned-down cups; the Kuan had a turned-down cup-stand, too! If the Kuan knew good form, who does not know good form?[34]</p><p>[Footnote 34: Kuan Chung (+ 645 B.C.), a famous man in his day, was chief minister to the Duke of Ch&#39;i, whom he raised to such wealth and power that he became the leading prince of the empire. His chief merit lay in taming the barbarous frontier tribes. The rest of his work was built upon sand and died with him.]</p><ol start="23"><li>The Master said to the Great Master[35] of Lu, We can learn how to play music; at first each part in unison; then a swell of harmony, each part distinct, rolling on to the finish.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 35: Of music.]</p><ol start="24"><li>The warden of Yi asked to see Confucius, saying, No gentleman has ever come here whom I have failed to see.</li></ol><p>The followers took him in.</p><p>On leaving he said, My two-three boys, why lament your fall? The Way has long been lost below heaven! Now Heaven shall make the Master into a warning bell.</p><ol start="25"><li><p>The Master said of the music of Shao, It is thoroughly beautiful, and thoroughly good, too. Of the music of Wu, he said, It is thoroughly beautiful, but not thoroughly good.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Rank without beauty; ceremony without reverence; mourning without grief, why should I cast them a glance?</p></li></ol><p>BOOK IV</p><ol><li><p>The Master said, Love makes a spot beautiful: who chooses not to dwell in love, has he got wisdom?</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Loveless men cannot bear need long, they cannot bear fortune long. Loving men find peace in love, the wise find profit in it.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Love alone can love others, or hate others.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A will set on love is free from evil.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Wealth and honours are what men desire; but do not go from the Way, to keep them. Lowliness and want are hated by men; but do not go from the Way, to escape them.</p></li></ol><p>Shorn of love, is a gentleman worthy of the name? Not for one moment may a gentleman sin against love; he must not do so in flurry and haste, nor do so in utter overthrow.</p><ol start="6"><li><p>The Master said, I have seen no one that loves love and hates uncharity. He that loves love will set nothing higher. The hater of uncharity is so given to love that no uncharity can enter into his life. If a man were to give his strength to love for one day, I have seen no one whose strength would fail him. There may be such men, but I have not seen one.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A man and his faults are of a piece. By watching his faults we learn whether love be his.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, To learn the Way at daybreak and die at eve were enough.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A knight[36] in quest of the Way, who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, it is idle talking to.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 36: <em>Shih:</em> a gentleman entitled to bear arms, not a knight in armour.]</p><ol start="10"><li><p>The Master said, A gentleman has no likes or dislikes below heaven. He follows right.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, The gentleman cherishes mind, the small man cherishes dirt. Gentlemen trust in the law, the small man trusts in favour.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, The chase of gain is rich in hate.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, What is it to sway a kingdom by courteous yielding? If we cannot sway a kingdom by courteous yielding, what is our courtesy worth?</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Care not for want of place; care for thy readiness to fill one. Care not for being unknown, but seek to be worthy of note.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, One line, Shen,[37] runs through my Way.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 37: The disciple Tseng-tzu.]</p><p>Yes, said Tseng-tzu.</p><p>After the Master had left, the disciples asked what was meant.</p><p>Tseng-tzu said, The Master&#39;s Way is no more than faithfulness and fellow-feeling.</p><ol start="16"><li><p>The Master said, The gentleman is learned in right; the small man is learned in gain.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, At sight of worth, think to grow like it; at sight of baseness, search thyself within.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A father or a mother may be gently chidden. If thou seest they have no will to follow thee, be the more lowly, but do not give way; nor murmur at the trouble they give thee.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Whilst thy father and mother are living, do not wander afar. If thou must travel, hold a set course.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, He that changes nothing in his father&#39;s ways for three years may be called pious.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A father and mother&#39;s years must be borne in mind; with gladness on the one hand and fear on the other.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, The men of old were loth to speak, for not to live up to their words would have shamed them.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, We shall seldom get lost if we hold to main lines.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A gentleman wishes to be slow to speak and quick to do.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, A great soul is never friendless: he has always neighbours.</p></li><li><p>Tzu-yu said, Nagging at kings brings disgrace, nagging at friends estrangement.</p></li></ol><p>BOOK V</p><ol><li>Of Kung-yeh Ch&#39;ang the Master said, A girl might be wedded to him. Though he has been in fetters that was not his crime.</li></ol><p>He gave him his daughter to wed.</p><p>Of Nan Jung the Master said, When the land keeps the Way he will not be neglected; and if the land loses the Way he will escape punishment and death.</p><p>He gave him his brother&#39;s daughter to wed.</p><ol start="2"><li><p>Of Tzu-chien[38] the Master said, What a gentleman he is! But if there were no gentlemen in Lu, where could he have picked it up?</p></li><li><p>Tzu-kung asked, And what of me?</p></li></ol><p>Thou art a vessel, said the Master.</p><p>What kind of vessel?</p><p>A rich temple vessel.</p><ol start="4"><li>One said, Yung[39] has love, but he is not glib.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 38: A disciple born in Lu.]</p><p>[Footnote 39: The disciple Chung-kung.]</p><p>The Master said, What is the good of being glib?

When Hui hears one thing, he understands ten; when I hear one thing I understand two.</p><p>The Master said, Thou art not his like.

I righted this on Yue.</p><ol start="10"><li>The Master said, I have met no firm man.</li></ol><p>One answered, Shen Ch&#39;ang.</p><p>The Master said, Ch&#39;ang is passionate; how can he be firm?</p><ol start="11"><li>Tzu-kung said, What I do not wish done to me, I likewise wish not to do to others.</li></ol><p>The Master said, That is still beyond thee, Tz&#39;u.</p><ol start="12"><li><p>Tzu-kung said, To hear the Master on his art and precepts is granted us; but to hear him on man&#39;s nature and the Way of Heaven is not.</p></li><li><p>Until Tzu-lu could do what he had heard, his only fear was to hear more.</p></li><li><p>Tzu-kung asked, Why was K&#39;ung-wen called cultured?</p></li></ol><p>The Master said, He was quick and loved learning; he was not ashamed to ask those beneath him: that is why he was called cultured.</p><ol start="15"><li><p>The Master said, Of the ways of a gentleman Tzu-ch&#39;an had four. His life was modest; he honoured those that he served. He was kind in feeding the people, and he was just in his calls upon them.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Yen P&#39;ing was a good friend. The longer he knew you, the more attentive he grew.</p></li><li><p>The Master said, Tsang Wen lodged his tortoise with hills on the pillars and reeds on the uprights: was this his wisdom?</p></li><li><p>Tzu-chang said, The chief minister, Tzu-wen, was thrice made minister without showing gladness, thrice he left office with unmoved looks. He always told the new ministers how the old ones had governed: how was that?</p></li></ol><p>He was faithful, said the Master.</p><p>But was it love?</p><p>I do not know, said the Master: how should this amount to love?</p><p>When Ts&#39;ui murdered the lord of Ch&#39;i, Ch&#39;en Wen threw up ten teams of horses and left the land.

He served none but his own lord, he ruled none but his own people. He came in when there was order, and withdrew when tumults came. Where lawless rule showed, or lawless people stayed, he could not bear to dwell. To be together with country folk he thought like sitting in court dress and court cap on dust and ashes.

He bowed left and right to those beside him, straightened his robes in front and behind, and swept forward, with arms spread like wings. When the guest had left, he brought back word, saying, The guest is no longer looking.</p></li><li><p>As he went in at the palace gate he stooped, as though it were too low for him.

In harmony is number; peace prevents a fall. Thus, if far off tribes will not submit, bring them in by encouraging mind and art, and when they come in give them peace. But now, when far off tribes will not submit, ye two, helpers of your lord, cannot bring them in. The kingdom is split and falling, and ye cannot save it.

When they flow from the great ministers they will rarely last for five generations. When underlings sway the country&#39;s fate they will rarely last for three generations.
