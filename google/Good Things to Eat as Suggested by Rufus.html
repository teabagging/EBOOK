CHICAGO</p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>That the average parent is blind to the faults of its offspring is a fact so obvious that in attempting to prove or controvert it time and logic are both wasted. Ill temper in a child is, alas! too often mistaken for an indication of genius; and impudence is sometimes regarded as a sign of precocity. The author, however, has honestly striven to avoid this common prejudice. This book, the child of his brain, and experience, extending over a long period of time and varying environment, he frankly admits is not without its faults--is far from perfect; but he is satisfied that, notwithstanding its apparent shortcomings, it will serve in a humble way some useful purpose.</p><p>The recipes given in the following pages represent the labor of years. Their worth has been demonstrated, not experimentally, but by actual tests, day by day and month by month, under dissimilar, and, in many instances, not too favorable conditions.</p><p>One of the pleasures in life to the normal man is good eating, and if it be true that real happiness consists in making others happy, the author can at least feel a sense of gratification in the thought that his attempts to satisfy the cravings of the inner man have not been wholly unappreciated by the many that he has had the pleasure of serving--some of whom are now his stanchest friends. In fact, it was in response to the insistence and encouragement of these friends that he embarked in the rather hazardous undertaking of offering this collection to a discriminating public.</p><p>To snatch from his daily toil a few moments, here and there, in order to arrange with some degree of symmetry, not the delicacies that would awaken the jaded appetite of the gourmet, but to prepare an ensemble that might, with equal grace, adorn the home table or banquet board, has proven a task of no mean proportions. Encouraged by his friends, however, he persevered and this volume is the results of his effort.</p><p>If, when gathered around the festal board, in camp or by fireside, on train or ship, &quot;trying out&quot; the recipes, his friends will pause, retrospectively, and with kindly feelings think from whence some of the good things emanated, the author will feel amply compensated for the care, the thought, the labor he has expended in the preparation of the book; and to those friends, individually and collectively, it is therefore dedicated.</p><p>SKETCH OF MY LIFE</p><p>I was born in Murray County, Tennessee, in 1857, a slave. I was given the name of my master, D. J. Estes, who owned my mother&#39;s family, consisting of seven boys and two girls, I being the youngest of the family.</p><p>After the war broke out all the male slaves in the neighborhood for miles around ran off and joined the &quot;Yankees.&quot; This left us little folks to bear the burdens. At the age of five I had to carry water from the spring about a quarter of a mile from the house, drive the cows to and from the pastures, mind the calves, gather chips, etc.</p><p>In 1867 my mother moved to Nashville, Tennessee, my grandmother&#39;s home, where I attended one term of school. Two of my brothers were lost in the war, a fact that wrecked my mother&#39;s health somewhat and I thought I could be of better service to her and prolong her life by getting work. When summer came I got work milking cows for some neighbors, for which I got two dollars a month. I also carried hot dinners for the laborers in the fields, for which each one paid me twenty-five cents per month. All of this, of course, went to my mother. I worked at different places until I was sixteen years old, but long before that time I was taking care of my mother.</p><p>At the age of sixteen I was employed in Nashville by a restaurant-keeper named Hemphill. I worked there until I was twenty-one years of age. In 1881 I came to Chicago and got a position at 77 Clark Street, where I remained for two years at a salary of ten dollars a week.</p><p>In 1883 I entered the Pullman service, my first superintendent being J. P. Mehen. I remained in their service until 1897. During the time I was in their service some of the most prominent people in the world traveled in the car assigned to me, as I was selected to handle all special parties. Among the distinguished people who traveled in my care were Stanley, the African explorer; President Cleveland; President Harrison; Adelina Patti, the noted singer of the world at that time; Booth and Barrett; Modjeski and Paderewski. I also had charge of the car for Princess Eulalie of Spain, when she was the guest of Chicago during the World&#39;s Fair.</p><p>In 1894 I set sail from Vancouver on the Empress of China with Mr. and Mrs. Nathan A. Baldwin for Japan, visiting the Cherry Blossom Festival at Tokio.</p><p>In 1897 Mr. Arthur Stillwell, at that time president of the Kansas City, Pittsburg &amp; Gould Railroad, gave me charge of his magnificent $20,000 private car. I remained with him seventeen months when the road went into the hands of receivers, and the car was sold to John W. Gates syndicate. However, I had charge of the car under the new management until 1907, since which time I have been employed as chef of the subsidiary companies of the United States Steel Corporation in Chicago.</p><p>HINTS TO KITCHEN MAIDS</p><p>It is always necessary to keep your kitchen in the best condition.</p><p>~Breakfast~--If a percolator is used it should first be put into operation. If the breakfast consists of grapefruit, cereals, etc., your cereal should be the next article prepared. If there is no diningroom maid, you can then put your diningroom in order. If hot bread is to be served (including cakes) that is the next thing to be prepared. Your gas range is of course lighted, and your oven heated. Perhaps you have for breakfast poached eggs on toast, Deerfoot sausage or boiled ham. One of the above, with your other dishes, is enough for a person employed indoors.</p><p>When your breakfast gong is sounded put your biscuits, eggs, bread, etc., in the oven so that they may be ready to serve when the family have eaten their grapefruit and cereal.</p><p>~Luncheon~--This is the easiest meal of the three to prepare. Yesterday&#39;s dinner perhaps consisted of roast turkey, beef or lamb, and there is some meat left over; then pick out one of my receipts calling for minced or creamed meats; baked or stuffed potatoes are always nice, or there may be cold potatoes left over that can be mashed, made into cakes and fried.</p><p>~Dinner~--For a roast beef dinner serve vegetable soup as the first course, with a relish of vegetables in season and horseradish or chow-chow pickle, unless you serve salad.</p><p>If quail or ducks are to be served for dinner, an old Indian dish, wild rice, is very desirable. Prepare this rice as follows:</p><p>Place in a double boiler a cupful of milk or cream to each cupful of rice and add salt and pepper to taste. It requires a little longer to cook than the ordinary rice, but must not be stirred. If it becomes dry add a little milk from time to time.</p><p>Do not serve dishes at the same meal that conflict. For instance, if you have sliced tomatoes, do not serve tomato soup. If, however, you have potato soup, it would not be out of place to serve potatoes with your dinner.</p><p>Fish should never be served without a salad of some kind.</p><p>The above are merely suggestions that have been of material assistance to me.</p><p>TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</p><p>Four teaspoonfuls of a liquid equal 1 tablespoonful.

Warm them over the fire, but do not let them boil; add a small quantity of thickening of potato flour mixed with a little water. When about to serve incorporate some cream and fine butter, garnishing with some chopped oysters and mushrooms, mixed with breadcrumbs and herbs.

Transfer to the soup kettle and pour in gradually, stirring all the time, three quarts of boiling water. Cook gently for fifteen or twenty minutes, then add a cupful of mashed potato and one of hot milk. Season with salt, pepper and a little nutmeg. Have in the soup tureen some croutons of bread toasted brown, pour the hot soup over them and serve. The sorrel should be cut in fine pieces before cooking. This is one of the delicacies of the early spring, its slightly acid flavor making it particularly appetizing.</p><p>~TOMATO SOUP~--Put one quart can of tomatoes, two cups of water, one-half level tablespoon of sugar, one level teaspoon of salt, four whole cloves, and four peppercorns together in a saucepan and simmer twenty minutes. Fry a rounding tablespoon of chopped onion and half as much minced parsley in a rounding tablespoon of butter until yellow, add two level tablespoons of cornstarch. Stir until smooth, then turn into the boiling soup and simmer ten minutes. Add more salt and pepper and strain.</p><p>~TOMATO SOUP~--Into a saucepan put one quart can of tomatoes and two cups of broth from soup bones. To make this cover the bones and meat with cold water and simmer slowly for several hours.

Mix and press through a strainer to take out the seeds and bits of vegetables, reheat, and serve with small croutons.</p><p>~TOMATO SOUP, CORNED BEEF STOCK~--Put one quart can tomatoes on to boil, add six peppercorns, one-half inch blade of mace and a bit of bay leaf the same size. Fry one sliced onion in one level tablespoonful butter or beef fat until slightly colored, add this to the tomato, and simmer until the tomato is quite soft, and the liquor reduced one-half. Stir in one-fourth teaspoon of soda, and when it stops foaming turn into a puree strainer and rub the pulp through. Put the strained tomato on to boil again and add an equal amount of corned beef liquor, or enough to make three pints in all.</p><p>Melt one heaped tablespoon butter in a smooth saucepan, add one heaped tablespoon cornstarch, and gradually add part of the boiling soup. Stir as it thickens, and when smooth stir this into the remainder of the soup. Add one teaspoon salt and one-fourth teaspoon paprika. Reserve one pint of this soup to use with spaghetti. Serve buttered and browned crackers with the soup.</p><p>~VEGETABLE BROTH~--Take turnips, carrots, potatoes, beets, celery, all, or two or three, and chop real fine. Then mix with them an equal amount of cold water, put in a kettle, just bring to a boil, not allowing it to boil for about three or four hours, and then drain off the water. The flavor will be gone from the vegetables and will be in the broth.</p><p>~VEGETABLE SOUP~--Take one-half a turnip, two carrots, three potatoes, three onions and a little cabbage. Run through a meat chopper with coarse cutter and put to cook in cold water. Cook about three hours. If you wish you can put a little bit of cooking oil in. When cooked add one quart of tomatoes. This will need about six quarts of water.</p><p>The most nutritious soups are made from peas and beans.</p><p>~VEGETABLE SOUP~ (without stock)--One-half cup each of carrot and turnip, cut into small pieces, three-fourths cup of celery, cut fine, one very small onion sliced thin, four level tablespoons of butter, three-fourths cup of potato, cut into small dice, one and one-half quarts of boiling water, salt and pepper to taste. Prepare the vegetables and cook the carrot, celery and onion in the butter for ten minutes without browning. Add the potato and cook for three minutes longer, then add the water and cook slowly for one hour. Rub through a sieve, add salt and pepper to taste, and a little butter if desired.</p><p>~WHITE SOUP~--Put six pounds of lean gravy beef into a saucepan, with half gallon of water and stew gently until all the good is extracted and remove beef. Add to the liquor six pounds of knuckle of veal, one-fourth pound ham, four onions, four heads of celery, cut into small pieces, a few peppercorns and bunch of sweet herbs. Stew gently for seven or eight hours, skimming off the fat as it rises to the top. Mix with the crumbs of two French rolls two ounces of blanched sweet almonds and put in a saucepan with a pint of cream and a little stock, boil ten minutes, then pass through a silk sieve, using a wooden spoon in the process. Mix the cream and almonds with the soup, turn into a tureen, and serve.</p><p>~WINE SOUP~--Put the yolks of twelve eggs and whites of six in an enameled saucepan and beat thoroughly. Pour in one and a half breakfast cupfuls of water, add six ounces of loaf sugar, the grated rind and strained juice of a large lemon, one and one-half pints of white wine. Whisk the soup over a gentle fire until on the point of boiling, removing immediately. Turn into a tureen, and serve with a plate of sponge cakes or fancy biscuits. (This soup should be served as soon as taken from fire.)</p><p>~CHESTNUT SOUP~--Peel and blanch the chestnuts, boil them in salted water until quite soft, pass through a sieve, add more water if too thick, and a spoonful of butter or several of sweet cream, season to taste, and serve with small squares of bread fried crisp in butter or olive oil.</p><p>FISH</p><p>~BOILED CODFISH, WITH CREAM SAUCE~--Take out the inside of a cod by the white skin of the belly, taking care to remove all blood. Place the fish in a kettle with salted cold water; boil fast at first, then slowly. When done take out and skin. Pour over it a sauce made as follows:</p><p>One-fourth pound butter put into a stewpan with one tablespoonful of flour, moistened with one pint of cream or rich milk, and salt and pepper, and also one teaspoonful essence of anchovies. Place the pan over the fire and let thicken, but not boil.</p><p>~BOILED MACKEREL~--Prepare and clean some mackerel. Put in water and boil until they are done. When cooked, drain and put the mackerel on a hot dish. Blanch some fennel in salted water. When it is soft drain and chop finely. Put one tablespoonful in half pint of butter sauce. Serve in a sauce boat with the fish.</p><p>~BOILED SALMON WITH SAUCE TARTARE~--Scrape the skin of the fish, wipe, and if you have no regular fish kettle with a perforated lid, tie in a piece of cheesecloth and place gently in a kettle of boiling salted water. Push the kettle back on the fire (where it will simmer gently, instead of boiling hard) and cook, allowing about six minutes to the pound. Remove carefully, drain, and chill. If the fish breaks and looks badly take out the bones, flake, pile lightly on the platter and pour the sauce over it. This may be a hot sauce Hollandaise or a cold sauce tartare.</p><p>~BROILED MACKEREL~--Draw and wash the mackerel. Cut off heads and rub over with salt and leave for an hour. Rub a gridiron with olive oil, lay the mackerel on it and broil over a charcoal fire. Place some chopped parsley and onions on a hot dish, with the hot fish, squeezing over the mackerel a little lemon juice. Serve hot.</p><p>~BROILED MACKEREL, WITH BLACK BUTTER~--Take some mackerel, open and remove bones. Season with butter, pepper, and salt. Place the fish on a gridiron and broil over a clear fire.

Place the fish on a hot dish, arrange some sprigs of parsley around it, and pour over it the butter sauce, and serve hot.</p><p>~CODFISH CONES~--When it is not convenient to make and fry fish balls try this substitute. Pick enough salt codfish into shreds to measure two cups and let stand in cold water for two or more hours, then drain dry. Make a sauce from one cup of hot milk, two level tablespoons each of flour and butter, and cook five minutes. Mash and season enough hot boiled potatoes to measure two cups, add the sauce and the fish and beat well with a fork. Shape in small cones, set on a butter pan, brush with melted butter and scatter fine bread crumbs over. Set in oven to brown.</p><p>~CODFISH HASH~--Take a cup of cooked cod, pick in pieces and soak in cold water for twelve hours. Boil some potatoes and add them to the finely chopped fish, a little at a time. Put in a saucepan with some butter and stir. Let it cook gently.</p><p>~FINNAN HADDIE FISH CAKES~--The finnan haddie parboiled with an equal quantity of mashed potatoes, season with melted butter, salt and pepper, add a beaten egg, and mold into cakes.</p><p>~FISH, EAST INDIA STYLE~--Peel two medium-sized onions, cut into thin slices. Put in a stewpan with a small lump of butter and fry until lightly browned. Pour over them some white stock, judging the quantity by that of the fish; one ounce of butter, little curry powder, salt, lemon juice, a little sugar, and cayenne pepper. Boil the stock for fifteen or twenty minutes, then strain into a stewpan, skim and put in the fish, having it carefully prepared. Boil gently, without breaking the fish. Wash and boil half a cup of rice in water, and when cooked it should be dried and the grains unbroken. Turn the curry out on a hot dish, garnish with croutons of fried bread. Serve hot, with the rice in separate dish.</p><p>~FISH EN CASSEROLE~--One of those earthen baking dishes with close-fitting cover of the same ware and fit for placing on the table is especially useful for cooking fish. For instance, take two pounds of the thick part of cod or haddock, both of which are cheap fish. Take off the skin and lay in the casserole. Make a sauce from two cups of milk heated, with a good slice of onion, a rounding tablespoon of minced parsley, a small piece of mace, a few gratings of the yellow rind of lemon, half a level teaspoon of salt, and a little white pepper. Cook in the top of a double boiler for twenty minutes. Heat one-quarter cup of butter in a saucepan, add three level tablespoons of flour, and cook smooth, turn on the hot milk after straining out the seasonings. Cook until thick and pour over the fish. Cover and bake half hour, then if the fish is done serve in the same dish with little finely minced parsley scattered over.</p><p>~LOUISIANA COD~--Melt one-quarter cup of butter and let it begin to color, add two level tablespoons of flour and stir until smooth. Add one cup of water and cook five minutes. Add half a level teaspoon of salt, half as much pepper, and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Chop fine one medium-size onion and one small green pepper, after taking out the seeds. Brown them in two tablespoons of butter, add one cup of strained tomatoes, a bit of bay leaf, and the prepared sauce. Put slices of cod cut an inch thick into a casserole, pour on the sauce, cover closely, and bake in a slow oven three-quarters of an hour.</p><p>~METELOTE OF HADDOCK~--Wash and skin the haddock and remove the flesh from the bones in firm pieces suitable for serving. Put the head, bones and trimmings to cook in cold water and add a small sliced onion and salt and pepper. Boil six good-sized onions until tender, then drain and slice and put half of them into a buttered baking dish. Arrange the pieces of fish on these, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then add the remaining onions. Drain the fish from the trimmings, add to it two tablespoons lemon juice and pour it over onions and fish. Cover very closely and cook in the oven until the fish is tender. Then drain off the liquid, heat it to the boiling point, and thicken it with two eggs slightly beaten and diluted with a little of the hot liquid. Arrange the onions on a hot platter and place the fish on top, then pour over the thickened liquid.</p><p>~A MOLD OF SALMON~--If where one cannot get fresh fish, the canned salmon makes a delicious mold. Serve very cold on a bed of crisp lettuce or cress. Drain off the juice from a can of salmon, and flake, picking out every fragment of bone and skin. Mix with the fish one egg lightly beaten, the juice of a half lemon, a cup fine dry bread crumbs, and salt and pepper to season. Pack in a buttered mold which has a tight-fitting tin cover, steam for two hours, and cool. After it gets quite cold set on the ice until ready to carve.</p><p>~OYSTERS A LA POULETTE~--One quart oysters, four level tablespoons butter, four level tablespoons flour, one-half level teaspoon salt, one-fourth level teaspoon celery salt, one-half cup oysters liquor, one cup each of chicken stock and milk, juice one-half lemon. Look over the oysters, heat quickly to the boiling point, then drain and strain the liquor through cheesecloth. Melt the butter, add the flour, salt and celery salt, and when blended add the oyster liquor, chicken stock and milk, stirring until thick and smooth. Cook for five minutes, then add the oysters and lemon juice, and serve at once.</p><p>~OYSTER FRICASSE~--Put one pint of oysters into a double boiler or into the top of the chafing dish. As soon as the edges curl add the slightly beaten yolks of three eggs, a few grains of pepper and half a teaspoon of salt. Set over hot water and as soon as the egg thickens add a teaspoon of lemon juice. Spread on slices of toasted brown bread and garnish with celery tips. Celery salt is a good addition to the seasoning.</p><p>~RECHAUFFE OF FINNAN HADDIE~--Cover a finnan haddie with boiling water and let it simmer for twenty minutes, then remove the kettle and flake, discarding the skin and bones. For three cups of fish scald two cups of thin cream and add to the fish. Season with paprika or a dash of cayenne, and when thoroughly heated stir in the yolks of two eggs, diluted with a little hot cream.</p><p>~SCALLOPED CLAMS IN SHELL~--Chop the clams very fine and season with salt and cayenne pepper. In another dish mix some powdered crackers, moistened first with warm milk, then with clam liquor, a beaten egg and some melted butter, the quantity varying with the amount of clams used; stir in the chopped clams. Wash clean as many shells as the mixture will fill, wipe and butter them, fill heaping full with the mixture, smoothing with a spoon. Place in rows in a baking pan and bake until well browned. Send to the table hot.</p><p>~SCALLOPED SHRIMPS~--Make a sauce with a level tablespoon of cornstarch, a rounding tablespoon of butter and one cup of milk cooked together five minutes. Season with one-quarter level teaspoon of salt and a few grains of cayenne. Add one can of shrimps after removing all bits of shell and mincing them fine. Use, if preferred, the same amount of fresh shrimps. Put into buttered scallop shells, scatter fine bread crumbs over the top of each, and dot with bits of butter. Set in a quick oven to brown the crumbs, and serve hot in the shells.</p><p>~STEWED CODFISH~--Take a piece of boiled cod, remove the skin and bones and pick into flakes. Put these in a stewpan, with a little butter, salt, pepper, minced parsley and juice of a lemon. Put on the fire and when the contents of the pan are quite hot the fish is ready to serve.</p><p>~CODFISH CONES~--When it is not convenient to make and preparation into shapes, dip them into egg beaten with cream, then in sifted breadcrumbs and let them stand for half an hour or so to dry; then fry them a delicate color after plunging into boiling lard. Take them out, drain, place on a napkin on a dish and serve. The remainder of the chicken stock may be used for making consomme or soup.</p><p>BEEF, VEAL AND PORK</p><p>~BEEF EN CASSEROLE~--Have a steak cut two inches thick and broil two minutes on each side. Lay in a casserole and pour round two cups of rich brown sauce; add three onions cut in halves.</p><p>~BEEF HASH CAKES~--Chop cold corned beef fine and add a little more than the same measure of cold boiled potatoes, chopped less fine than the beef. Season with onion juice, make into small cakes, and brown in butter or beef drippings; serve each cake on a slice of buttered toast moistened slightly.</p><p>~BEEF RAGOUT~--Another way to serve the remnants of cold meat is to melt one rounding tablespoon of butter in a pan and let it brown lightly. Add two rounding tablespoons of flour and stir until smooth and browned; add one cup of strained tomato and one cup of stock or strained gravy, or part gravy and part water. When this sauce is thickened add two cups of meat cut in small, thin slices or shavings. Stir until heated through and no longer, as that will harden the meat.

Serve with a gravy made from the contents of the pan or with a tomato sauce.</p><p>~BROILED LIVER AND BACON~--As broiling in most cases is wasteful, the liver and bacon are generally fried together, but the dish is somewhat spoiled by this method. The best way is to fry the well-trimmed slices of bacon, and after having washed and sliced the liver, say a third of an inch thick, dry it on a cloth and dip in flour.

Cover the bones with cold water and when it comes to a boil skim, then add a little onion and carrot and a few seasoning herbs and any spices desired. Simmer gently for an hour or so until you have a pint of stock. To make the stuffing take a stale loaf, cut off the crust and soak in a little cold water until soft.

Add two or three cloves, pour hot stock around it, cover closely and braise in a hot oven for three hours.</p><p>~SPANISH CHOPS~--Gash six French chops on outer edge, extending cut more than half way through lean meat.

Add a half onion chopped fine or grated, a tablespoonful of salt, a teaspoonful pepper and a teaspoonful seasoning herbs.

For those who wish a steak well done--completely through--and still not to have the outside crisp to a cinder, it is necessary to cut the steak possibly as thin as one-half inch, and then the outside can have that delicious and intense scorching which quickly prevents the escape of juices, and also gives the slightly burned taste which at its perfect condition is the most delicious flavor from my own preference that can be given to a steak. By this I do not mean a steak burned to a cinder, but slightly scorched over a very hot fire.</p><p>~FOR RARE BROILED STEAK~--For those who are fond of rare steak it can be cut from one inch to one and one-quarter inches in thickness and the outside thoroughly and quickly broiled, leaving the inside practically only partially cooked, so that the blood will follow the knife and still the steak has been heated completely through and a thin crust on either side has been well cooked, which has formed the shell to retain the juices.</p><p>~PROPERLY FRYING STEAK~--To fry steak properly (although some claim it is not proper to fry steak under any circumstances), it is necessary to have the butter, oleo, fat or grease piping hot, for two reasons: First, the steak sears over quickly, and the juices are thus retained within the steak to better advantage than by the slow process of cooking, but even more important is the fact that the incrustation thus formed not only holds the juices within the steak, but prevents the fat from penetrating and making the steak greasy, soggy and unattractive. As a rule, however, we must acknowledge that broiled steak is in varying degrees largely superior to fried steak.</p><p>~BROILED LOIN STEAKS~--Two loin steaks of about a pound each: season with salt and pepper to taste, baste on either side with a little oil.

Poultry intended for dinner should be killed the evening before. When poultry has ceased to bleed, before picking put it into cold water, in a vessel large enough to completely cover it. Then take out and soak in boiling water for a few minutes. Pick it, being careful to take out all the small feathers. When cleaning the inside of poultry or game be sure not to break the gall bladder, for it will give a bitter taste to the meat. Be equally careful not to tear the intestines near the gizzard, as it will make the inside dirty and spoil the whole bird.</p><p>POULTRY AND POULTRY DRESSINGS</p><p>~BOHEMIAN CHICKEN~--Select a young and tender chicken and prepare as for frying or broiling.

Turn out on a flat dish, and serve with a rich brown gravy.</p><p>~BOILED CELERY~--Trim off the tops of the celery about one-third of their length, and also trim the roots into rounding shape. Save the tops for making cream of celery and for garnishes, cook the celery in salted water until tender, drain, lay on toast, and pour a cream sauce over.</p><p>~BOSTON BAKED BEANS~--Pick over a quart of small pea beans, wash thoroughly and soak over night in warm water. In the morning parboil them until the skins crack open. Pour off the water. Put into the bottom of a glazed earthenware pot, made expressly for the purpose, a pint of hot water in which have been dissolved a half tablespoonful salt, two tablespoonfuls molasses, a half teaspoonful mustard, and a pinch of soda. Pack in the beans until about a third full, then place in it a pound (or less, if preferred) of streaked pig pork, the skin of which has been scored. Cover with a layer of beans, letting the rind of the pork just show through. Now add enough more seasoned hot water to cover the beans, and bake covered in a slow oven all day or night. When done the beans should be soft, tender and moist but brown and whole, and the pork cooked to a jelly.</p><p>~BREADED POTATO BALLS~--Pare, boil and mash potatoes and whip into three cups of potato three level tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons of hot milk, salt and pepper to taste; also two teaspoons of onion juice and two level tablespoons of chopped parsley, one-quarter cup of grated mild cheese and two well-beaten eggs. Beat well and set aside to cool. Mold into small balls, roll each in beaten egg, in fine stale breadcrumbs, and then fry in deep hot fat.</p><p>~CABBAGE AND CHEESE~--Boil the cabbage in two waters, then drain, cool and chop. Season well with salt and pepper and spread a layer in a buttered baking dish. Pour over this a white sauce made from a tablespoonful each of flour and butter and a cup of milk. Add two or three tablespoonfuls of finely broken cheese. Now add another layer of cabbage, then more of the white sauce and cheese, and so on until all the material is used. Sprinkle with fine crumbs, bake covered about half an hour, then uncover and brown.</p><p>~CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN~--Select a firm, well-shaped cauliflower, and after the preliminary soaking in cold salt water throw into a kettle of boiling water and cook half an hour, until tender. Drain, pick off the flowers and lay to one side, while you pick the stalks into small pieces. Lay on the bottom of a rather shallow buttered baking dish, sprinkle with pepper, grated cheese and cracker crumbs. Dot with pieces of butter. Add a little milk, then a layer of the flowerets and another sprinkling of milk, cheese and pepper.</p><p>~CAULIFLOWER FRITTERS~--Soak and boil the cauliflower in the usual way, then separate into flowers. Dip each piece into a thin batter, plunge into boiling fat and fry a delicate brown. Serve very hot on napkins. If preferred, the pieces may be dipped into a mixture of salt, pepper, vinegar and oil, then fried.</p><p>~CREAMED SPAGHETTI~--Have two quarts of water boiling in a kettle and one-third of a pound of spaghetti. Hold a few pieces of the spaghetti at a time in the water and as the ends soften turn them round and round and down into the kettle. When all are in the water put on a cover and cook the spaghetti twenty minutes, then drain.</p><p>Make a cream sauce with a rounding tablespoon each of flour and butter and one cup of cream. Season with one-half teaspoon of salt and a few grains of pepper. Stir in the spaghetti cut in inch pieces, turn on to a dish, and sprinkle with finely grated cheese.</p><p>~FRIED CORN~--Cut the corn off the cob, leaving the grains as separate as possible. Fry in just enough butter to keep it from sticking to the pan, stirring very often. When nicely browned add salt and pepper and a little rich cream. Do not set near the fire after adding the cream.</p><p>~FRIED TOMATOES~--Wipe some smooth solid tomatoes and slice and fry in a spider with butter or pork fat. Season well with salt and pepper.</p><p>~GLAZED CARROTS WITH PEAS~--Wash, scrape and cut three medium-sized carrots in one-fourth inch slices, then, in cubes or fancy shapes, drain and put in saucepan with one-half cup butter, one-third cup sugar, and one tablespoon fine chopped fresh mint leaves.

When hot lay in raw, pared sweet potatoes cut in halves, lengthwise. Dust with salt and pepper and put in another layer of seasoned potatoes and enough boiling water to stand one-half inch deep in the dish. Put on the close-fitting cover and set in the oven to cook slowly. When the potatoes are tender serve in the same dish with the sweet sauce that will not be entirely absorbed in the cooking. This way of preparing sweet potatoes pleases the Southern taste, which demands sugar added to the naturally sweet vegetable.</p><p>~GLAZED SWEET POTATOES~--Sweet potatoes, like squash and peas, lose a little of their sweetness in cooking, and when recooked it is well to add a little sugar. Slice two large cooked sweet potatoes and lay in a small baking dish, sprinkle with a level tablespoon of sugar and a few dashes of salt and pepper, add also some bits of butter. Pour in one-half cup of boiling water, bake half an hour, basting twice with the butter and water.</p><p>~GREEN MELON SAUTE~--There are frequently a few melons left on the vines which will not ripen sufficiently to be palatable uncooked. Cut them in halves, remove the seeds and then cut in slices three-fourths of an inch thick. Cut each slice in quarters and again, if the melon is large, pare off the rind, sprinkle them slightly with salt and powdered sugar, cover with fine crumbs; then dip in beaten egg, then in crumbs again, and cook slowly in hot butter, the same as eggplant. Drain, and serve hot. When the melons are nearly ripe they may be sauted in butter without crumbs.</p><p>~JAPANESE OR CHINESE RICE~--Wash one cup of rice, rubbing it through several waters until the water runs clear. Put in porcelain-lined stewpan with a quart of soup stock and bay leaves and boil twenty minutes. The stock must be hot when added to the rice. Shake the kettle in which it is cooking several times during the cooking and lift occasionally with a fork. Do not stir. Pour off any superfluous stock remaining at the end of twenty minutes, and set on the back of the stove or in the oven, uncovered, to finish swelling and steaming. Just before serving add one cup of hot tomato juice, a quarter cup of butter, a tablespoon chopped parsley, a dash of paprika, and one tablespoon of grated cheese. Serve with grated cheese.</p><p>~LIMA BEANS WITH NUTS~--Soak one cup of dry lima beans over night. In the morning rip off the skins, rinse and put into the bean pot with plenty of water and salt to season, rather more than without the nuts. Let cook slowly in the oven and until perfectly tender; add one-half cup of walnut meal, stirring it in well; let cook a few minutes, and serve.</p><p>~MACARONI WITH APRICOTS~--Stew twenty halves of fresh apricots in half a cup of sugar and enough water to make a nice sirup when they are done. Before removing from the fire add a heaping tablespoonful of brown flour and cook until the sirup is heavy and smooth. Parboil ten sticks of macaroni broken in two-inch pieces, drain, add to one pint of scalding hot milk two ounces of sugar. Throw in the parboiled macaroni and allow it to simmer until the milk is absorbed; stir it often. Pour all the juice or sauce from the apricots into the macaroni, cover the macaroni well, set on back of the stove for fifteen minutes, then take off and allow to cool.

Cut cold boiled potatoes into thick slices, or, better still, into half-inch cubes. Butter a baking dish, put in it a layer of the sauce, then one of the potatoes, previously lightly seasoning with salt and pepper. Continue until all are in, the proportion of potato being about two cupfuls.</p><p>To one cupful of dried and sifted breadcrumbs, add one teaspoonful of melted butter and stir until it is evenly mixed through. Spread this over the contents of the baking dish, and place in a quick oven for twenty minutes, or until nicely browned. For a change, a little onion juice, chopped parsley or grated cheese may be added to the sauce.</p><p>~POTATO CREAMED~--Cut cold boiled potatoes into small dice and cover them in a small saucepan with milk. Let them stand where they will heat slowly and absorb nearly all the milk. When hot add to one pint of potatoes a tablespoon of salt and a dash of white pepper. Sprinkle a little finely chopped parsley over the top as a garnish.</p><p>~POTATO MOLD~--Mash some potato smoothly, add to it some butter and a little milk to make it smooth but not wet. Season with white pepper and salt and add enough chopped parsley to make it look pretty. Press into greased mold and bake for half an hour until lightly browned. Dust with crumbs and serve.</p><p>~POTATO PARISIENNE~--Potato marbles seasoned with minced parsley, butter and lemon juice are liked by many. Others find that they are not sufficiently seasoned, that is, the seasoning has not penetrated into the potatoes, especially if a large cutter has been used. This method will be found to remedy this fault, giving a seasoning which reaches every portion of the potato. It may not be quite so attractive as the somewhat underdone marbles, but the flavor is finer.</p><p>Pare the potatoes and steam or boil them until soft, being careful they do not cook too fast. Drain off the water and let them stand uncovered until dry. Then cut in quarters lengthwise, and then in thin slices, letting them drop into a stewpan containing melted butter, salt and paprika. When all are sliced cover them and let them heat for a few minutes, add minced parsley and lemon Juice, shake them about so the seasoning will be well mixed and serve at once.</p><p>~POTATO PUFFS~--~No. 1~--To one cup of mashed potato add one tablespoon of butter, one egg, beaten light, one-half cup of cream or milk, a little salt. Beat well and fill popover pans half full. Bake until brown in quick oven.</p><p>~POTATO PUFFS~--~No. 2~--Add hot milk to cold mashed potato beat up thoroughly. Add one or two well-beaten eggs, leaving out the yolks if preferred whiter. Drop in spoonfuls on a buttered tin, place a piece of butter on the top of each and bake a delicate brown or put in a pudding dish and butter the top and bake till of a light brown on top. Fifteen minutes in a hot oven will be sufficient.</p><p>~RICE A LA GEORGIENNE FOR FIVE PERSONS~--Wash one pound of rice in several changes of cold water until water is clear, and cook until soft, but not soft enough to mash between the fingers.

Cover the bottom of a small buttered baking dish with buttered cracker crumbs, cover with tomatoes and sprinkle the top thickly with buttered crumbs. Bake in a hot oven. Buttered cracker crumbs are made by simply rolling common crackers with a rolling pin and allowing one-third cupful of melted butter to each cupful of crumbs. This recipe takes about one and one-third cupfuls of crumbs.</p><p>~SPAGHETTI A L&#39;ITALIENNE~--Let it cook until the water nearly boils away and it is very soft. The imported spaghetti is so firm that it may be cooked a long time without losing its shape. When the water has boiled out, watch it and remove the cover so it will dry off. Then draw the mass to one side and put in a large lump of butter, perhaps a tablespoon, and let it melt, then stir in until the butter is absorbed, and pour on one cup of the strained juice from canned tomatoes. Season with salt and paprika, and let it stew until the spaghetti has absorbed the tomato. The spaghetti, if cooked until soft, will thicken the tomato sufficiently and it is less work than to make a tomato sauce. Turn out and serve as an entree, or a main dish for luncheon and pass grated sap sago or other cheese to those who prefer it. When you have any stock like chicken or veal, add that with the tomato or alone if you prefer and scant the butter.</p><p>~STUFFED CABBAGE~--Cut the stalk out of two or more young cabbages and fill with a stuffing made from cooked veal, chopped or ground very fine, seasoned well with salt and pepper, and mixed with the beaten yolk of an egg.

Drain, unbind and serve hot.</p><p>~STUFFED EGG PLANT~--Wash a large egg plant, cut in halves the long way and scoop the inside out with a teaspoon, leaving each shell quite empty, but unbroken. Cook the inside portion in one-half cup of water, then press through a strainer and mix with one-half cup of bread crumbs, one rounding tablespoon of butter and season with salt and pepper.

Strain it through a fine hair sieve and stir in one and one-half ounces of liquefied butter mixed with a little flour to thicken it.

Take them out, and when they are quite tender strain the liquor into another pan and chop up the gizzards, livers, and other parts into small pieces. Take a little of the thickening left at the bottom of the pan in which a chicken or goose has been braised, and after the fat has been taken off, mix it with the giblet liquor and boil until dissolved. Strain the sauce, put in the pieces of giblet, and serve hot.</p><p>~GOOSEBERRY SAUCE~--Pick one pound of green gooseberries and put them into a saucepan with sufficient water to keep them from burning, when soft mash them, grate in a little nutmeg and sweeten to taste with moist sugar. This sauce may be served with roast pork or goose instead of apple sauce. It may also be served with boiled mackerel. A small piece of butter will make the sauce richer.</p><p>~HALF-GLAZE SAUCE~--Put one pint of clear concentrated veal gravy in a saucepan, mix it with two wine-glassfuls of Madeira, a bunch of sweet herbs, and set both over the fire until boiling. Mix two tablespoonfuls of potato flour to a smooth paste with a little cold water, then mix it with the broth and stir until thick. Move the pan to the side of the fire and let the sauce boil gently until reduced to two-thirds of its original quantity. Skim it well, pass it through a silk sieve, and it is ready for use.</p><p>~HAM SAUCE~--After a ham is nearly all used up pick the small quantity of meat still remaining, from the bone, scrape away the uneatable parts and trim off any rusty bits from the meat, chop the bone very small and beat the meat almost to a paste. Put the broken bones and meat together into a saucepan over a slow fire, pour over them one-quarter pint of broth, and stir about one-quarter of an hour, add to it a few sweet herbs, a seasoning of pepper and one-half pint of good beef stock. Cover the saucepan and stir very gently until well flavored with herbs, then strain it. A little of this added to any gravy is an improvement.</p><p>~HORSERADISH SAUCE~--Place in a basin one tablespoonful of moist sugar, one tablespoonful of ground mustard, one teacupful of grated horseradish, and one teaspoonful of turmeric, season with pepper and salt and mix the ingredients with a teacupful of vinegar or olive oil. When quite smooth, turn the sauce into a sauceboat, and it is ready to be served.</p><p>~LEMON BUTTER~--Cream four level tablespoons of butter and add gradually one tablespoon of lemon juice mixing thoroughly.</p><p>~LEMON SAUCE FOR FISH~--Squeeze and strain the juice of a large lemon into a lined saucepan, put in with it one-fourth pound butter and pepper, and salt to taste.

Then put in the parsley and minced lemon, and pour in as much clear stock as will be required to make the sauce. Season with a small quantity of pounded mace, and stir the whole over the fire a few minutes. Beat the yolks of two eggs with two tablespoonfuls of cold stock, and move the sauce to the side of the fire, and when it has cooled a little, stir in the eggs.

Mix together one ounce ground ginger, two tablespoonfuls black pepper, two teaspoonfuls ground cloves, a quarter pound white mustard seed, one-half cupful ground mustard, one ounce allspice, three ounces celery seed and three pounds brown sugar. Now put the sliced onions and tomatoes in a kettle with sugar and spices in alternate layers, and pour over them enough white wine vinegar to cover well. Cook the pickle until tender, then pack in jars and seal.</p><p>~GREEN TOMATO MINCE~--To two quarts chopped apples, greenings are best, allow two quarts chopped green tomatoes, one pound each seeded raisins and cleaned currants, one-half nutmeg, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful ground cloves, six cups granulated sugar and a cupful and a half of cider vinegar. Boil slowly three or four hours and can.</p><p>~PICALILLI~--Allow to one gallon sliced green tomatoes one pint grated horseradish, eleven ounces brown sugar, two tablespoons each of fine salt and ground mustard. Put the tomatoes in a large stone crock, sprinkle the salt over them and let stand over night with a slight press on top. In the morning add to the tomatoes and let stand several weeks until it has formed its own vinegar. Always keep the pickle under the liquor and have it in a cool place.</p><p>~PEPPER RELISH~--Chop fine a small head of white cabbage, six large green peppers, and a nice bunch of celery. Put in a large bowl and sprinkle with a half cup of salt, mix well, cover and let stand over night. Next morning drain and mix in two tablespoons of mustard seed, and pack in a stone jar. Put in a porcelain kettle three pints of vinegar, two tablespoons sugar, one tablespoon each of whole cloves, allspice and whole pepper, a clove of garlic and one onion minced. Simmer gently twenty minutes, strain and pour boiling hot over the vegetables. When cold cover and keep in a cool place.</p><p>~TOMATO CATSUP~--This catsup has a good relish on account of the onion in it. Wash ripe tomatoes, cut them in slices and cook slowly for one hour. Press through a sieve to take out the seeds and skin. To one quart of this pulp and juice add one tablespoon of cinnamon, one of black pepper and one of mustard, one teaspoon of cayenne, one-half cup of salt and two onions chopped fine. Simmer two and one-half hours, then add two cups of vinegar, cook an hour longer. Put in bottles and seal.</p><p>~TOMATO CHUTNEY~--Cut up and peel twelve large tomatoes and to them add six onions chopped fine, one cup of vinegar, one cup of sugar, a handful of finely chopped raisins, salt to taste, a half teaspoonful of cayenne and a half teaspoonful of white pepper.

Bottle in glass jars and keep in a cool place.</p><p>~APPLE AND GRAPE JELLY~--Pull the grapes off the stems of six large bunches, put them in a preserving kettle, just cover with water. Pare and slice six large fall pippin apples. Put them with the grapes. When boiled soft strain through a flannel bag. To a pint of juice allow three quarters of a pound of sugar. Boil the juice fifteen minutes, skim and add the sugar, which has been heated. Boil ten or fifteen minutes. This will fill three jelly glasses.</p><p>~BLACK CURRANT JELLY~--This is one of the best old-fashioned remedies for sore throats, while a teaspoonful of it dissolved into a tumbler of cold water affords a refreshing fever drink or family beverage on a hot day. Stem large ripe black currants and after washing put into the preserving kettle, allowing a cupful of water to each quart of fruit. This is necessary because the black currant is drier than the red or white. Mash with a wooden spoon or pestle, then cover and cook until the currants have reached the boiling point and are soft. Turn into a jelly bag and drain without squeezing. To each pint of the juice allow a half pound loaf sugar. Stir until well mixed, then cook just ten minutes from the time it commences to boil. Overcooking makes it tough and stringy. Pour in sterilized glasses and when cold cover with paraffin.</p><p>~CANNED PINEAPPLE~--Pare the pineapple and carefully remove the eyes with a sharp-pointed silver knife. Chop or grate or shred it with a fork, rejecting the core. Weigh, and to every pound of fruit allow a half pound of sugar, put all together in the preserving kettle, bring quickly to boiling, skim, and remove at once. Put into jars and fill to overflowing with sirup, and seal.</p><p>~CHERRY PRESERVES~--Select large red cherries, stem and stone them, and save the juice. Weigh the fruit and an equal amount of sugar.

Cook gently about twenty minutes, take from the fire, add one pound walnut meats, and cool.</p><p>~CHERRY JELLY~--The juice of cherries does not make a firm jelly without the addition of gelatin. This means that it will not keep, but must be eaten soon after making. But if a soft jelly will satisfy it can be made, and kept like other jellies, without gelatin. To make this jelly crush ripe cherries and cook until soft, with just enough water to keep from burning. Strain and measure, to each cup of juice allow a cup of sugar. Simmer the juice ten minutes, heat the sugar and drop into the boiling juice. In a few minutes a soft jelly will form.</p><p>~CRANBERRY MOLD~--This is an extremely pretty way of serving cranberries in individual molds. Wash a quart of cranberries and put in a porcelain or granite saucepan. Sprinkle over the top of the berries two cupfuls of sugar and on top of the sugar pour one cupful cold water. Set over the fire and cook slowly. When the berries break into a boil, cover just a few moments, not long, or the skins will burst, then uncover and cook until tender. Do not strain, but pour at once into small china molds. This gives a dark rich looking mold that is not too acid and preserves the individuality of the fruit. If you wish to use some of the cranberries in lieu of Maraschino cherries, take up some of the most perfect berries before they have cooked too tender, using a darning needle or clean hat pin to impale them. Spread on an oiled plate and set in warming oven or a sunny window until candied.</p><p>~CURRANT AND RASPBERRY JELLY~--Some of the finest jellies and jams are made from raspberries combined with currants. For jelly use two-thirds of currant juice to one-third raspberry juice and finish in the usual way.</p><p>~FIG PRESERVES~--Take the figs when nearly ripe and cut across the top in the form of a cross. Cover with strong salted water and let stand three days, changing the water every day. At the end of this time cover with fresh water, adding a few grape or fig leaves to color, and cook until quite green. Then put again in cold water, changing twice daily, and leave three days longer. Add a pound granulated sugar to each pound figs, cook a few moments, take from the fire and set aside for two days. Add more sugar to make sweet, with sliced and boiled lemon or ginger root to flavor, and cook until tender and thick.</p><p>~GREEN GRAPE MARMALADE~--If, as often happens, there are many unripened grapes still on the vines and frost threatens, gather them all and try this green grape marmalade. Take one gallon stemmed green grapes, wash, drain and put on to cook in a porcelain kettle with one pint of water. Cook until soft, rub through a sieve, measure and add an equal amount of sugar to the pulp. Boil hard twenty-five minutes, watching closely that it does not burn, then pour into jars or glasses. When cold cover with melted paraffin, the same as for jelly.</p><p>~GREEN TOMATOES CANNED FOR PIES~--To fifteen pounds round green tomatoes sliced thin allow nine pounds granulated sugar and a quarter pound ginger, washed, scraped and cut very thin, and four lemons scrubbed and sliced thin, removing all seeds. Put this mixture over the fire with a pint of water and cook about half an hour, taking care the contents of the kettle do not scorch. Turn into sterilised glass jars and seal air tight. A tablespoonful of cinnamon and a half tablespoonful each of cloves and allspice may be added to the sauce while cooking if desired.</p><p>~PEAR AND BLUEBERRY PRESERVES~--Pick over and wash two quarts of blueberries, add water to nearly cover and stew them half hour. Mash them well, when all are broken turn into a bowl covered with cheese cloth. Drain well and when cool squeeze out all the juice. Put the blueberry juice on to boil, add one pint of sugar to each pint of juice and remove all scum. Allow one quart of sliced pears to one pint of juice. Use hard pears not suitable for canning. Cook them in the syrup, turning over often and when soft and transparent skim them out into the jars. Boil down the syrup and strain over the fruit. Fill to overflowing and seal.</p><p>~PRESERVED CURRANTS~--Weigh seven pounds of currants before picking over, then stem them and throw out all that are not perfect. Put seven pounds of sugar with three pints of currant juice and boil three minutes, add the currants, one pound of seeded raisins, and cook all twenty minutes. Seal in small jars.</p><p>~PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES~--The following method for preserving strawberries is highly recommended. Weigh the berries and allow an equal amount of sugar. As two cups weigh a pound, the sugar can be measured. Put the sugar into the preserving kettle with enough cold water to moisten it, but not enough to make it a liquid. Set the kettle on the back of the range, and when the sugar has entirely dissolved lay in the fruit and heat. As soon as it boils skim and cook five minutes. Do not stir or mash the berries. Now spread them around on deep platters or enameled pans and cover with panes of window glass. Set in the sun, and the syrup will gradually thicken. Turn into small jars and seal.</p><p>~RHUBARB JAM~--Add to each pound of rhubarb cut without peeling, a pound of sugar and one lemon. Pare the yellow peel from the lemon, taking care to get none of the bitter white pith. Slice the pulp of the lemon in an earthen bowl, discarding the seeds. Put the rhubarb into the bowl with the sugar and lemon, cover and stand away in a cool place over night. In the morning turn into the preserving kettle, simmer gently three-quarters of an hour or until thick, take from the fire, cool a little and pour into jars.</p><p>~SPICED CRABAPPLES~--Wash the crabapples, cut out the blossoms end with a silver knife. To four pounds of fruit take two pounds of sugar, one pint of vinegar, one heaping teaspoon each of broken cinnamon, cassia buds and allspice, add one scant tablespoon whole cloves. Tie the spices in a thin bag and boil with the vinegar and sugar five minutes. Skim them, add the apples and simmer slowly until tender; which will take about ten or fifteen minutes. Skim out the apples, putting them in a large bowl or jar. Boil the sugar five minutes longer and pour over the fruit. Next day drain off the syrup, heat to the boiling point and pour again over the apples. Do this for the next two days, then bottle and seal while hot.</p><p>~SPICED CRABAPPLE JELLY~--With crabapples still on hand a nice spiced jelly can be made to serve with meats. Cook the apples without peeling until tender. Strain through a jelly bag, add vinegar to taste with cloves and cinnamon. Cook twenty minutes, add an equal quantity of sugar that has been heated in the oven. Boil five minutes, skim and turn in glasses.</p><p>~SPICED RIPE TOMATO~--Peel ripe tomatoes and weigh. For each seven pounds allow two cups of vinegar, seven cups of sugar, one ounce of whole allspice, the same of stick cinnamon and one-half ounce of whole cloves. Cook the tomatoes half an hour or until soft, cutting to pieces while cooking. Add the vinegar, sugar and spices tied in a muslin bag. Cook until thick like marmalade. Serve with cold meats.</p><p>~TOMATO FIGS~--Scald eight pounds of yellow tomatoes and remove the skins. Pack them in layers with an equal weight of sugar. After twenty-four hours drain off the juice and simmer five minutes, add the tomatoes and boil until clear. Remove the fruit with a skimmer and harden in the sun while you boil down the syrup until thick; pack jars two-thirds full of the tomatoes, pour the syrup over and seal. Add the juice of four lemons, two ounces of green ginger root tied up in a bag and the parboiled yellow rind of the lemons to the juice when boiling down.</p><p>~WILD GRAPE BUTTER~--If the wild frost grapes are used, take them after the frost has ripened them. Stem and mash, then mix with an equal quantity of stewed and mashed apple. Rub the mixture through a sieve, add half as much sugar as there is pulp and cook until thick, being careful that it does not burn. It is a good idea to set preserves and fruit butters in the oven with the door ajar to finish cooking as there is then much less danger of burning or spattering.</p><p>~YELLOW TOMATO PRESERVES~--Allow a pound sugar to each pound tomatoes and half cup of water to each pound fruit. Cover the tomatoes with boiling water, then skim. Make a syrup with the sugar, and when boiling skim and add the tomatoes.

Put this filling in thick layers between the cakes and cover the top one with a white icing.</p><p>~FIG OR DATE FROSTING~--These frostings are excellent to use upon any kind of cake, but as they are rather rich in themselves, they seem better suited for light white cake. If figs are preferred they should be chopped fine. If dates, the stones and as much as possible of the white lining should be removed and then they should be chopped fine. For a good size loaf of cake, baked in two layers, use a scant quarter of a pound of either the chopped dates or figs, put into a double boiler or saucepan with a very little boiling water, just enough to make the mass pliable. Let them stand and heat while the syrup is boiling. For this two cups of fine granulated sugar and half a cup of boiling water are required. Boil without stirring till the syrup taken upon the spoon or skewer will &quot;thread.&quot; Do not allow it to boil too hard at first. When the sugar is thoroughly melted, move the saucepan to a hotter part of the stove so that it may boil more vigorously. Have ready the whites of two eggs beaten dry, now to them add the fig or date paste and pour the boiling syrup in a fine stream over the two, beating all the time. Beat occasionally while cooling, and when thoroughly cold add one teaspoonful of lemon extract, and it is ready for use.

In the meantime wash one cup of sweet butter in cold water to take out all the salt. Put in a piece of cheesecloth and pat it until all the moisture is dried out. Beat until creamy, adding slowly the beaten yolk of one egg and the syrup. Spread this filling between layer cakes, but it is more often used to pipe over the top of small cakes.</p><p>~ORANGE FILLING~--One-half cup of sugar, two and one-half level tablespoons flour, grated rind of one-half orange, one-third cup of orange juice, one tablespoon lemon juice, one egg beaten slightly, one teaspoon melted butter.

Lay a sheet of paraffin paper over the bottom of a large baking part and drop the mixture on the paper, in any size you wish from one teaspoon to two tablespoons. Have them some distance apart so they will not run together. Bake them in a very moderate oven and be careful to bake sufficiently, say forty-five minutes. They should be only delicately colored and yet dry all through. When done remove to a platter and break the top in, remove a little of the inside and fill pulp of sifted peaches, sweetened and mixed with equal parts of whipped cream. Sprinkle pistachio nuts over the top and serve fancy cakes.</p><p>~BAKED CUSTARD~--Beat four eggs, whites and yolks together lightly, and add a quart of milk, four tablespoons sugar, a pinch of salt and flavoring.

Serve at once.</p><p>~FIG AND RHUBARB~--Wash two bunches of rhubarb and cut into inch pieces without peeling. Put into boiler with a cupful sugar and four or five figs cut in inch pieces. Put on the cover and cook over hot water until the rhubarb is tender and the syrup is rich and jelly-like in consistency. Raisins are nice cooked in rhubarb the same way.

Bake in a moderate oven.</p><p>~CRANBERRY AND CUSTARD PUDDING~--Here is a new suggestion which comes from a high authority. Take one sugar cooky or four lady fingers, if you have them, and crumble into a baking dish. Cover with a thin layer of cranberry preserves or jelly, dot with small lumps of butter and add a sprinkle of cinnamon. Beat three eggs (separately) very lightly, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and two cupfuls of milk. Pour over the fruit and cake, bake as a custard and serve with whipped cream.</p><p>~CUSTARD PUDDING~--Line a baking dish with slices of sponge cake. Make a boiled custard with four cups of milk and the yolks of five eggs, one-half cup of sugar, and flavored with vanilla. Pour the custard into the baking dish.

Set in a very slow oven to brown slightly.</p><p>~DATE MERINGUE~--Beat the whites of five eggs until stiff, add three rounding tablespoons of powdered sugar, and beat again. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice and a half a pound of stoned and chopped dates. Turn into a buttered baking dish and bake fifteen minutes in a moderate oven. Serve with a boiled custard.</p><p>~EGG SOUFFLE~--Make a sauce from one cup of hot milk and two level tablespoons each of butter and flour, cooked together five minutes in a double boiler. Add the yolks of four eggs beaten well, stir enough to mix well and remove from the fire. Add half a level teaspoon of salt and a few grains of cayenne. Fold in the whites of the eggs beaten stiff, turn into a buttered dish, set in a pan of hot water, and bake in a slow oven until firm. Serve in the same dish.</p><p>~FRUIT PUDDING~--One and one-half cups flour, two and one-half cups raisins, one-half cup molasses, one-half cup milk, two tablespoons butter, one teaspoon cinnamon, one-half teaspoon allspice, one-half teaspoon nutmeg, one-half teaspoon salt, mix all together, one-half teaspoon soda, dissolved in hot water, steam two hours. Hard or liquid sauce, or both.</p><p>~INDIAN TAPIOCA PUDDING~--One-third cup tapioca, one-fourth cup cornmeal, one quart scalded milk, half cup molasses, two tablespoons butter, one-half teaspoon salt, one teaspoon ginger and cinnamon mixed, one cup cold milk. Soak the tapioca in cold water for one hour, then drain. Pour the hot milk on to the cornmeal gradually. Add the tapioca and cook in double boiler until transparent. Add molasses, butter, salt, and spice, and turn into a buttered baking dish. Pour the cold milk over the top and bake for one hour in a moderate oven.</p><p>~LEMON MERINGUE PUDDING~--Soak one cup of fine breadcrumbs in two cups of milk until soft. Beat one-quarter cup of butter and one-half of sugar together until greasy, stir all into the milk and crumbs. Grate a little yellow lemon peel over the top and pour into a buttered baking dish. Set in a moderate oven until firm and slightly browned. Make a meringue of the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs and four level tablespoons of powdered sugar. Spread over the pudding, return to the oven and color a little.</p><p>~LEMON PUDDING~--Three eggs, one scant cup sugar, one lemon juice and rind, two cups of milk, two liberal tablespoons cornstarch, one heaping teaspoon butter. Scald the milk and stir in the cornstarch, stirring all the time until it thickens well, add the butter and set aside to cool. When cool beat the eggs, light; add sugar, the lemon juice and grated rind, and whip in a great spoonful at a time, the stiffened cornstarch and milk. Bake in a buttered dish and eat cold.</p><p>~LITTLE STEAMED PUDDING~--Cream one-quarter cup butter with one-half cup of sugar, add one-quarter cup milk, then one cup of flour sifted with two teaspoons of baking powder and a pinch of salt, and last fold in the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs. Have some small molds or cups buttered, fill half full with the batter, cover with buttered paper, and steam three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot with a sauce.</p><p>~NEW HAMPSHIRE INDIAN MEAL PUDDING~--Bring a quart of milk to a boil, then sprinkle in slowly about a cup and a quarter of yellow meal, stirring constantly. (An exact rule for the meal cannot be given, as some swells more than others.) As soon as the milk is thickened take from the fire and cool slightly before adding three-quarters of a cup of molasses, half a teaspoonful salt and a tablespoonful ginger. Beat the mixture until smooth, and lastly turn in a quart of cold milk, stirring very little. Pour into a well greased pudding-dish and set in a very slow oven. This pudding needs about five hours of very slow baking to insure its becoming creamy, instead of hard and lumpy. The batter, after the cold milk is added should be about the consistency of pancake batter. Serve with cream or maple syrup.</p><p>~ORANGE PUDDING~--Take one cup of fine stale breadcrumbs, not dried, and moisten them with as much milk as they will absorb and become thoroughly softened. Beat the yolks of four eggs with the whites of two, add four tablespoons of sugar and the grated peel of one orange, using of course only the outer cells. Stir this into the softened crumbs, then beat the other two whites until stiff and fold them into the mixture. Turn it into a well buttered mold and steam it two hours. Turn out into a hot dish and serve with orange sauce.</p><p>~PEACH TAPIOCA~--Prepare a dish of tapioca in the usual way, into a buttered pudding dish put a layer of cooked and sweetened tapioca, then a layer of peaches, fresh or canned. Next add another layer of tapioca, then more peaches, and so on until the dish is full. Flavor with lemon and sprinkle three-fourths of a cup of sugar over all, then bake in a very hot oven until a light brown.</p><p>~RASPBERRY DUMPLINGS~--Wash one cup of rice and put into the double boiler. Pour over it two cups of boiling water, add one-half teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons of sugar and cook thirty minutes or until soft. Have some small pudding cloths about twelve inches square, wring them out of hot water and lay them over a small half pint bowl. Spread the rice one-third of an inch thick over the cloth, and fill the center with fresh raspberries. Draw the cloth around until the rice covers the berries and they are good round shape. Tie the ends of the cloth firmly, drop them into boiling water and cook twenty minutes. Remove the cloth and serve with lemon sauce.</p><p>~SPOON PUDDING~--Cream one tablespoonful butter with two tablespoonfuls sugar. Add two tablespoonfuls flour, pinch of salt, one tablespoonful cornstarch, beaten yolk of one egg and tablespoonful of cream. Beat well, and lastly add beaten white of egg and one teaspoonful baking powder. Pour over berries and steam forty minutes. Serve with whipped cream.</p><p>~SQUASH PUDDING~--One pint of finely mashed cooked squash, one cup of sugar, one teaspoon of ground cinnamon, a little salt, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, add slowly one quart of boiling milk, stirring well, and when a little cooled, add five well beaten eggs. Bake in a pudding dish set in a pan of hot water, in a moderate oven, until firm in the center. Serve with cream.</p><p>~STEAMED BERRY PUDDING~--Sift two cups of flour with four teaspoons of baking powder, rub in a rounding tablespoon of butter, add two beaten eggs, one cup of milk, one-half cup of sugar, and last two cups of blueberries. The berries should be rinsed in cold water, shaken in a cheese cloth until dry and then roiled in flour before adding. Pour into a pudding mold, and steam one and one-quarter hours. Serve with liquid sauce.</p><p>~STEAMED PUDDING~--Beat one-half cup of butter with one cup of sugar to a cream, add two beaten eggs and cup of flour sifted with one teaspoon each of cinnamon and soda, two cups of breadcrumbs, soaked in one cup of sour milk. Add one cup of chopped and seeded raisins and one-half cup of chopped dates. Steam two hours and serve with whipped cream.</p><p>~TAPIOCA MERINGUE~--Soak one-half cup granulated tapioca in a pint of cold water for half an hour. Cook slowly twenty minutes until transparent. If too thick, add a little more boiling water. Boil one quart of milk in a farina kettle with a pinch of salt and the yellow rind of half lemon. Beat the yolks of four eggs with a cup of sugar, add slowly to the milk, stirring until smooth and creamy, but do not allow it to boil. When thickened, remove from the fire, add a teaspoonful flavoring and blend thoroughly. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth with three tablespoonfuls powdered sugar and a teaspoonful flavoring, spread over the top of the pudding which should have been poured in the serving dish and set in a coolish oven to puff and color a golden yellow.</p><p>~TAPIOCA PUDDING~--Cover one cup of the flake tapioca with cold water and let it stand two hours. Stir occasionally with a fork to separate the lumps. Put in a farina kettle with a pint and a half water.</p><p>Slice three tart apples and put in with the tapioca, together with sugar to sweeten to taste. Stir all together and cook until the apples are soft and the tapioca clear. Serve hot or cold. Peaches may be used in place of the apple. Serve with cream.</p><p>~TAPIOCA SOUFFLE~--Soak three tablespoonfuls pearl tapioca in water to cover for three or four hours. Then add a quart of milk and cook until the tapioca is perfectly clear and the milk thickened. It will take about twenty minutes, and unless you use the farina kettle, must be stirred constantly. Add the yolks of four eggs beaten with two-thirds cup sugar and cook two or three minutes, stirring steadily. Whip the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, fold through the cooked cream, and take directly from the fire. Flavor with lemon or vanilla and bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five minutes. Chill and serve. This may also be served as a pudding without the final baking.</p><p>~WHOLE WHEAT PUDDING~--Put one cup of milk, one-half cup of molasses, two cups of graham or whole wheat flour, one cup of chopped raisins and half a saltspoon of salt into a bowl and add one level teaspoon of soda, dissolved in a tablespoon of warm water, beat hard for three minutes. Pour the thin batter into a buttered pudding mold and steam two and a half hours. Serve with a lemon sauce or cream.</p><p>~YORKSHIRE PUDDING~--Take an equal number of eggs and tablespoonful of sifted flour and when the eggs are well beaten mix them in with the flour, add some salt and a little grated nutmeg and then pour in as much new milk as will make a batter of the consistency of cream, stir the batter with a fork well for ten minutes and then put in at once into a baking tin, which must be very hot, containing a couple of tablespoons of hot drippings. Set the pudding in oven to bake or before the fire under the roasting meat. When ready to serve cut the pudding into squares and send to the table on a separate dish.</p><p>SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS</p><p>~FRUIT SYRUP SAUCE~--One cup fruit syrup, one-half cup sugar, one teaspoon butter. Use the syrup from apricots, peaches, cherries, quinces or any fruit you prefer. The amount of sugar will depend upon the acidity of the fruit. Mix the cornstarch with the sugar, add the syrup and boil all together five minutes. Add the butter last.</p><p>~LEMON SAUCE~--Grate the rind and squeeze the juice of one lemon. Mix together three teaspoons cornstarch, one cup of sugar and two cups of boiling water, and cook ten minutes, stirring constantly. Add the lemon rind and juice and one teaspoon of butter.</p><p>~LEMON SAUCE~--Mix three dessert spoons of cornstarch with one cup of sugar, pinch of salt, in a saucepan, pour on two cups boiling water and stir quickly as it thickens. When it is smooth set it back where it will simply bubble and simmer, and stir occasionally. Add the grated rind and juice of one lemon and one rounding tablespoon butter. If this is too thick add more hot water as it thickens in cooling, and you want it thin enough to pour easily.</p><p>~LEMON SAUCE~--Mix three tablespoons of cornstarch with one cup of cold water and turn on one cup of boiling water. Boil ten minutes, then add one cup of sugar, the juice and grated yellow rind of one lemon and two rounding tablespoons of butter.</p><p>~LEMON SAUCE FOR FRITTERS~--Mix four level teaspoons of cornstarch with one cup of sugar, and stir at once into two cups of boiling water, add the juice and grated yellow rind of one lemon and cook six minutes, add three level tablespoons of butter.</p><p>~ORANGE SAUCE No. 1~--Mix one and a half tablespoons of cornstarch with one cup of sugar, and stir it into one pint of boiling water. Let it cook quickly and stir as it thickens, and after ten minutes add two tablespoons of butter and one-half cup of orange juice. Cook two minutes longer then serve.</p><p>~ORANGE SAUCE No. 2~--Chip the yellow rind from an orange and squeeze the juice over it. Let stand half an hour. Stir one-quarter cup of flour into one cup of sugar and turn into two cups of boiling water. Cook ten minutes, add a pinch of salt, the orange rind and juice, stir and strain.</p><p>~RASPBERRY SAUCE FOR ICE CREAM~--If you think that a good ice cream is yet not quite fine enough, pour a raspberry sauce over each portion as served. Add one-quarter cup of sugar to one cup of raspberry juice prepared as for jelly-making, and simmer five minutes. Add a rounding teaspoon of arrow-root made smooth in one tablespoon of cold water, and cook five minutes. Now add one tablespoon of strained lemon juice and let boil up once.</p><p>~SAUCE FOR CHERRY PUDDING~--Put two cups of cherry juice, or juice and water, into a saucepan, stir in three level tablespoons of corn starch and cook fifteen minutes. Add two-thirds cup of sugar and a tablespoon of lemon juice.</p><p>~SAUCE FOR BATTER PUDDING~--Beat together in a bowl three rounding tablespoons of sugar, two level tablespoons of butter and one of flour. When the mixture is white add one-half cup of boiling water and stir until all is well melted. Add a little lemon juice and serve.</p><p>~SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS~--Beat the whites of three eggs until stiff, add one-half cup powdered sugar and the grated yellow rind of half a lemon. Pour on slowly one cup of boiling water, stirring all the time and the sauce is ready to serve.</p><p>~STRAWBERRY SAUCE~--Beat together one-half cupful of butter and a cup of sugar until white and light. The success of this sauce depends upon the long beating. Add to the creamed butter and sugar the stiffly whipped white of an egg and a cupful of strawberries mashed to a pulp.</p><p>BEVERAGES</p><p>~COCOA WITH WHIPPED CREAM~--Heat four cups of milk to the scalding point over hot water, or in a double boiler. Milk should be heated by direct contact with the fire. Mix a few grains of salt, three level tablespoons of cocoa and one-fourth cup of sugar to a paste with a little of the milk, then add three-fourths cup of boiling water and boil one minute, add to the hot milk and beat two minutes by the clock. Serve with a tablespoon of beaten or whipped cream on top of each cup.</p><p>~CURRANT JULEP~--Pick over currants and measure two cups. Mash them and pour on two cups of cold water. Strain and chill the juice. Put one tablespoon of simple syrup in a tall glass, add three bruised fresh mint leaves and fill with the currant juice. Add three or four perfect raspberries and serve. The syrup is made by simmering for twenty minutes, one cup of sugar and two of water.</p><p>~CURRANT SHRUB~--Pick over and mash two quarts of ripe currants, add one pint of vinegar, and let stand over night. Set on the range and bring to the boiling point, then strain twice. Measure the clear liquid, and allow one cup of sugar to each cup of liquid. Simmer twenty minutes and seal in bottles.</p><p>~RASPBERRY SHRUB~--Put one quart of ripe raspberries in a bowl, add two cups of vinegar, mash the berries slightly, and let stand over night. In the morning, scald and strain until clear. Measure, and to each cup of juice add one cup of sugar, boil twenty minutes and seal.</p><p>~STRAWBERRY SYRUP~--Pick over, rinse, drain and remove the hulls from several quarts of ripe berries. Fill a porcelain lined double boiler with the fruit and set it over the lower boiler half full of boiling water, and let it heat until the juice flows freely. Mash the berries, then turn out into a cloth strainer and cook the remainder of the fruit in the same way. When all the juice is pressed out, measure it and allow an equal amount of sugar. Let the juice come to the boiling point, add the sugar and cook five minutes from the time the whole begins to boil. Turn into jars or bottles and seal the same as canned fruit. This is excellent for beverages, flavoring ice cream and other fancy creams, and will be found desirable for many purposes when fresh fruit is not at hand.</p><p>ADDITIONAL RECIPES</p><p>+-------------------------------------------------------------------+ |Transcribers note: From Page 87 the index is one page out.
