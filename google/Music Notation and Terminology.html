GEHRKENS, A.M.</p><p>Associate Professor of School Music Oberlin Conservatory of Music</p><p>[Illustration: [publisher logo]]</p><p>The A. S. Barnes Company New York 1914 Copyright, 1914, by The A. S. Barnes Company</p><p>PREFACE</p><p>The study of <em>music notation and terminology</em> by classes in conservatories and in music departments of colleges and normal schools is a comparative innovation, one reason for the non-existence of such courses in the past being the lack of a suitable text-book, in which might be found in related groups clear and accurate definitions of the really essential terms. But with the constantly increasing interest in music study (both private and in the public schools), and with the present persistent demand that music teaching shall become more systematic and therefore more efficient in turning out a more <em>intelligent</em> class of pupils, it has become increasingly necessary to establish courses in which the prospective teacher of music (after having had considerable experience with music itself) might acquire a concise and accurate knowledge of a fairly large number of terms, most of which he has probably already encountered as a student, and many of which he knows the general meaning of, but none of which he perhaps knows accurately enough to enable him to impart his knowledge clearly and economically to others.</p><p>To meet the need of a text-book for this purpose in his own classes the author has been for several years gathering material from all available sources, and it is hoped that the arrangement of this material in related groups as here presented will serve to give the student not only some insight into the present meaning of a goodly number of terms, but will also enable him to see more clearly <em>why</em> certain terms have the meaning which at present attaches to them. To this latter end the derivations of many of the terms are given in connection with their definition.</p><p>The aim has not been to present an exhaustive list, and the selection of terms has of course been influenced largely by the author&#39;s own individual experience, hence many teachers will probably feel that important terms have been omitted that should have been included. For this state of affairs no apology is offered except that it would probably be impossible to write a book on this subject which would satisfy everyone in either the selection or actual definition of terms.</p><p>In formulating the definitions themselves an attempt has been made to use such words as <em>note</em>, <em>tone</em>, et cetera with at least a fair degree of accuracy, and while the attitude of the author on this point may be criticized as being puristic and pedantic, it is nevertheless his opinion that the next generation of music students and teachers will be profited by a more accurate use of certain terms that have been inaccurately used for so long that the present generation has to a large extent lost sight of the fact that the use is inaccurate. The author is well aware of the fact that reform is a matter of growth rather than of edict, but he is also of the belief that before reform can actually begin to come, the <em>need</em> of reform must be felt by a fairly large number of actively interested persons. It is precisely because so few musicians realize the need of any change in music terminology that the changes recommended by committees who have given the matter careful thought are so slow in being adopted. It is hoped that some few points at which reform in the terminology of music is necessary may be brought to the attention of a few additional musicians thru this volume, and that the cause may thus be helped in some slight degree.</p><p>It is suggested that in using the book for class-room purposes the teacher emphasize not only the definition and derivation of all terms studied, but the spelling and pronunciation as well. For this latter purpose a pronouncing index has been appended.</p><p>It is impossible to give credit to all sources from which ideas have been drawn, but especial mention should be made of the eminently clear and beautifully worded definitions compiled by Professor Waldo S. Pratt or the Century Dictionary, and the exceedingly valuable articles on an almost all-inclusive range of topics found in the new edition of Grove&#39;s Dictionary. Especial thanks for valuable suggestions as to the arrangement of the material, etc., are also due to Dr. Raymond H. Stetson, Professor of Psychology, Oberlin College; Arthur E. Heacox, Professor of Theory, Oberlin Conservatory of Music; and Charles I. Rice, Supervisor of Music, Worcester, Mass., as well as to various members of the Music Teachers&#39; National Association who have offered valuable advice along certain specific lines.</p><p>K.W.G.</p><p>OBERLIN CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC, <em>June, 1913</em></p><p>CONTENTS</p><p>CHAPTER I.--Some Principles of Correct Notation 1</p><ol><li>Note. 2, 3.

The hook is often called <em>tail</em> or cross-stroke. The stem appears on the right side of the head when turned up, but on the left side when turned down.[1] [Illustration] The hook is always on the right side.[2] [Illustration]</li></ol><p>[Footnote 1: It should be noted at the outset that this statement regarding the down-turned stem on the left side of the note-head, and also a number of similar principles here cited, refer more specifically to music as it appears on the printed page. In the case of hand-copied music the down-turned stem appears on the right side of the note, thus [note symbol]. This is done because of greater facility in writing, and for the same reason other slight modifications of the notation here recommended may sometimes be encountered. In dealing with children it is best usually to follow as closely as possible the principles according to which <em>printed</em> music is notated, in order to avoid those non-satisfying and often embarrassing explanations of differences which will otherwise be unavoidable.]</p><p>[Footnote 2: An exception to this rule occurs in the case of notes of unequal value stroked together, when the hook appears on the left side, thus [Illustration].]</p><pre><code> In writing music with pen the head and hook are best made with
 a heavy pressure on the pen point, but in writing at the board
 they are most easily made by using a piece of chalk about an
 inch long, turned on its side.
</code></pre><ol start="2"><li>When only one part (or voice) is written on the staff, the following <em>rules for turning stems</em> apply: (1) If the note-head is <em>below</em> the third line, the stem must turn up. (2) If the note-head is <em>above</em> the third line the stem must turn down. (3) If the note-head is <em>on</em> the third line the stem is turned either up or down with due regard to the symmetrical appearance of the measure in which the note occurs. The following examples will illustrate these points.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 1.]</p><ol start="3"><li>When two parts are written on the same staff, the stems of the upper part all turn up, and those of the lower part turn down, in order that the parts may be clearly distinguished. (Fig. 2.) But in music for piano and other instruments on which complete chords can be sounded by <em>one</em> performer and also in simple, four-part vocal music in which all voices have approximately the same rhythm, several notes often have one stem in common as in Fig. 3.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 2.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 3.]</p><ol start="4"><li>Notes of small denomination (eighths and smaller) are often written in groups of two or more, all stems in the group being then connected by <em>one cross-stroke</em>. In such a case all the stems must of course be turned the same way, the direction being determined by the position of the majority of note-heads in the group. Notes thus <em>stroked</em> may be of the same or of different denomination. See Fig. 4.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 4.]</p><p>In vocal music notes are never thus stroked when a syllable is given to each note. (See p. 19, Sec. 55, C.)</p><ol start="5"><li><p><em>Rests</em>, like notes, are best made with a heavy pen stroke or by using a piece of chalk on its side. (See note under Sec. 1.) The double-whole rest, whole rest, and half rest occupy the third space unless for the sake of clearness in writing two parts on the same staff they are written higher or lower. The rests of smaller denomination may be placed at any point on the staff, the hooks being always placed on the spaces. The hook of the eighth rest is usually placed on the <em>third</em> space. Rests are sometimes dotted, but are never tied.</p></li><li><p>The <em>G clef</em> should be begun at the second line rather than below the staff. Experiments have shown clearly that beginners learn to make it most easily in this way, and the process may be further simplified by dividing it into two parts, thus, [Illustration]. The descending stroke crosses the ascending curve at or near the fourth line. The circular part of the curve occupies approximately the first and second spaces.</p></li><li><p>The <em>F clef</em> is made either thus, [bass clef symbol], or thus, [old bass clef symbol], the dots being placed one on either side of the fourth line of the staff, which is the particular point that the clef marks. The C <em>clef</em> has also two forms, [C clef symbol] and [tenor clef symbol].</p></li><li><p>The <em>sharp</em> is made with two light vertical strokes, and two heavy slanting ones, the slant of the latter being upward from left to right, [sharp]. The sharp should never be made thus, [Illustration].</p></li></ol><p>The <em>double sharp</em> is made either thus [double-sharp symbol] or [old double-sharp symbol], the first form being at present the more common.</p><ol start="9"><li>The <em>flat</em> is best made by a down stroke retraced part way up, the curve being made without lifting pen from paper. The <em>double flat</em> consists of two flats,[3] [flat][flat]. The <em>natural</em> or <em>cancel</em> is made in two strokes, down-right and right-down, thus [Illustration].</li></ol><p>[Footnote 3: It is to be hoped that the figure for the double-flat suggested by Mattheson (who also suggested the St. Andrew&#39;s cross ([symbol]) for the double-sharp) may some time be readopted. This figure was the Greek letter B, made thus, [Greek: b], and its use would make our notation one degree more uniform than it is at present.]</p><ol start="10"><li><p>The <em>tie</em> usually connects the <em>heads</em> of notes, thus [tie symbol].</p></li><li><p>The <em>dot after a note</em> always appears on a space, whether the note-head is on a line or space. (See Fig. 5.) In the case of a dot after a note on a line, the dot usually appears on the space <em>above</em> that line if the next note is higher in position and on the space below it if the following note is lower.</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 5.]</p><pre><code> _Note._--Correct notation must be made a habit rather than a
 theory, and in order to form the habit of writing correctly,
 _drill_ is necessary. This may perhaps be best secured by
 asking students to write (at the board or on ruled paper) from
 verbal dictation, thus: Teacher says,

 &quot;Key of B[flat], three-quarter measure: First measure, DO a
 quarter note, RE a quarter, and MI a quarter. Second measure,
 SOL a quarter, LA a quarter, and SOL a quarter. Third measure,
 LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, eighths, stroked in pairs. Fourth measure,
 high DO a dotted half.&quot; Pupils respond by writing the exercise
 dictated, after which mistakes in the turning of stems, etc.,
 are corrected. The _pitch names_ may be dictated instead of
 the syllables if desired, and still further practice may be
 provided by asking that the exercise be transposed to other
 keys.
</code></pre><p>CHAPTER II</p><p>SYMBOLS OF MUSIC DEFINED</p><ol start="12"><li>A <em>staff</em> is a collection of parallel lines, together with the spaces belonging to them. The modern staff has five lines and six spaces, these being ordinarily referred to as first line, second line, third line, fourth line, and fifth line (beginning with the lowest); and space below (<em>i.e.</em>, space below the first line), first space, second space, third space, fourth space, and space above.</li></ol><p>The definition and discussion above refer more specifically to one of the portions of the &quot;great staff,&quot; the latter term being often applied to the combination of treble and bass staffs (with one leger line between) so commonly used in piano music, etc.</p><ol start="13"><li>The <em>extent of the staff</em> may be increased either above or below by the addition of short lines called <em>leger lines</em>,[4] and notes may be written on either these lines or on the spaces above and below them.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 4: The word <em>leger</em> is derived from the French word <em>LEGER</em>, meaning light, and this use of the word refers to the fact that the leger lines, being added by hand, are lighter--<em>i.e.</em>, less solid in color--than the printed lines of the staff itself.]</p><ol start="14"><li><p>The lines and spaces constituting the staff (including leger lines if any) are often referred to as <em>staff degrees</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, each separate line and space is considered to be &quot;a degree of the staff.&quot; The tones of a scale are also sometimes referred to as &quot;degrees of the scale.&quot;</p></li><li><p>A <em>clef</em>[5] is a sign placed on the staff to designate what pitches are to be represented by its lines and spaces. Thus, <em>e.g.</em>, the G clef shows us not only that the second line of the staff represents G, but that the first line represents E, the first space F, etc. The F clef similarly shows us that the fifth line of the bass staff represents the first A below middle C, the fourth line the first F below middle C, etc.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 5: The word <em>clef</em> is derived from <em>CLAVIS</em>--a key--the reference being to the fact that the clef unlocks or makes clear the meaning of the staff, as a key to a puzzle enables us to solve the puzzle.]</p><p>The student should note that these clefs are merely modified forms of the letters G and F, which (among others) were used to designate the pitches represented by certain lines when staff notation was first inaugurated. For a fuller discussion of this matter see Appendix A, p. 101. [Transcriber&#39;s Note: Corrected error &quot;Appendix I&quot; in original.]</p><ol start="16"><li>When the G clef is used the staff is usually referred to as the <em>treble staff</em>, and when the F clef is used, as the <em>bass staff</em>. Such expressions as &quot;singing from the treble clef,&quot; or &quot;singing in the treble clef,&quot; and &quot;singing in the bass clef&quot; are still frequently heard, but are preferably replaced by &quot;singing from the treble staff,&quot; and &quot;singing from the bass staff.&quot; Fig. 6 shows the permanent names of lines and spaces when the G and F clefs are used.[6]</li></ol><p>[Footnote 6: The Germans use the same pitch designations as we do with two exceptions, viz., our B is called by them H, and our B[flat] is called B. The scale of C therefore reads: C, D, E, F, G, A, H, C; the scale of F reads F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F. The signatures are in all cases written exactly as we write them.</p><p>In France and Italy where the &quot;fixed DO&quot; system is in vogue, pitches are usually referred to by the syllable names; <em>e.g.</em>, C is referred to as DO (or UT), D as RE, etc.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 6.]</p><ol start="17"><li><em>The movable C clef</em> [C clef symbol] or [tenor clef symbol], formerly in very common use, is now utilized for only two purposes, viz., (1) in music written for certain orchestral instruments (cello, viola, etc.) of extended range, in order to avoid having to use too many leger lines; and (2) for indicating the tenor part in vocal music. This latter usage seems also to be disappearing however, and the tenor part is commonly written on the treble staff, it being understood that the tones are to be sung an octave lower than the notes would indicate.</li></ol><p>The C clef as used in its various positions is shown in Figs. 7, 8, and 9. It will be noted that in each case the line on which the clef is placed represents &quot;middle C.&quot;</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 7. Soprano clef.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 8. Alto clef.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 9. Tenor clef.]</p><ol start="18"><li><p>A <em>sharp</em> is a character which causes the degree of the staff with which it is associated to represent a pitch one half-step higher than it otherwise would.</p><p>Thus in Fig. 10 (<em>a</em>) the fifth line and first space represent the pitch F, but in Fig. 10 (<em>b</em>) these same staff degrees represent an entirely different tone--F[sharp]. The student should note that the sharp does not then <em>raise</em> anything; it merely causes a staff degree to represent a higher tone than it otherwise would. There is just as much difference between F and F[sharp] as between B and C, and yet one would never think of referring to C as &quot;B raised&quot;!</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 10.]</p><ol start="19"><li><p>A <em>flat</em> is a character that causes the degree of the staff with which it is associated to represent a tone one half-step lower than it otherwise would. (See note under Sec. 18 and apply the same discussion here.)</p></li><li><p>A <em>double-sharp</em> causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole-step higher than it would without any sharp. Similarly, a double-flat causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole-step lower than it would without any flat.</p><p>Double-sharps and double-flats are generally used on staff degrees that have already been sharped or flatted, therefore their practical effect is to cause staff degrees to represent pitches respectively a half-step higher and a half-step lower than would be represented by those same degrees in their diatonic condition. Thus in Fig. 10 (<em>b</em>) the first space in its diatonic condition[7] represents F-sharp, and the double-sharp on this degree would cause it to represent a pitch one-half step higher than F-sharp, <em>i.e.</em>, F-double-sharp.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 7: The expression &quot;diatonic condition&quot; as here used refers to the staff after the signature has been placed upon it, in other words after the staff has been prepared to represent the pitches of the diatonic scale.]</p><p>CHAPTER III</p><p>SYMBOLS OF MUSIC DEFINED (<em>Continued</em>)</p><ol start="21"><li>The <em>natural</em>[8] (sometimes called <em>cancel</em>) annuls the effect of previous sharps, flats, double-sharps, and double-flats, within the measure in which it occurs. After a double-sharp or double-flat the combination of a natural with a sharp, or a natural with a flat is often found: in this case only one sharp or flat is annulled. (Sometimes also the single sharp or flat will be found by itself, cancelling the double-sharp or double-flat). The natural is often used when a composition changes key, as in Fig. 11, where a change from E to G is shown.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 8: It has already been noted (p. 6, Note) that in the German scale our b-flat is called b, and our b is called H. From this difference in terminology has grown up the custom of using the H (now made [natural]) to show that <em>any</em> staff-degree is in <em>natural</em> condition, <em>i.e.</em>, not sharped or flatted.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 11.]</p><ol start="22"><li><p>The group of sharps or flats (or absence of them) at the beginning of a staff partially indicates the key in which the composition is written. They are called collectively the <em>key-signature</em>.</p></li><li><p>The same key-signature may stand for either one of two keys, the major key, or its relative minor, hence in order to determine in what key a melody is one must note whether the tones are grouped about the major tonic DO or the minor tonic LA. In a harmonized composition it is almost always possible to determine the key by referring to the last bass note; if the final chord is clearly the DO chord the composition is in the major key, but if this final chord is clearly the LA chord then it is almost certain that the entire composition is in the minor key. Thus if a final chord appears as that in Fig. 12 the composition is clearly in G major, while if it appears as in Fig. 13, it is just as surely in E minor.</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 12.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 13.]</p><ol start="24"><li>Sharps, flats, naturals, double-sharps and double-flats, occurring in the course of the composition (<em>i.e.</em>, after the key signature) are called <em>accidentals</em>, whether they actually cause a staff degree to represent a different pitch as in Fig. 14 or simply make clear a notation about which there might otherwise be some doubt as in Fig. 15, measure two.

 the phrase is short (as in the two-note phrase), and when the

 This is a matter of such diverse usage that it is difficult to
 generalize regarding it. The tendency seems at present to be
 in the direction of using the slur (_in instrumental music_)
 as a phrase-mark exclusively, it being understood that unless
 there is some direction to the contrary, the tones are to be
 performed in a connected manner.

The following are the embellishments most commonly found: Trill (or shake), mordent, inverted mordent (or prall trill), turn (gruppetto), inverted turn, appoggiatura and acciaccatura.</li></ol><p>Usage varies greatly in the interpretation of the signs representing these embellishments and it is impossible to give examples of all the different forms. The following definitions represent therefore only the most commonly found examples and the most generally accepted interpretations.</p><ol start="65"><li><p>The <em>trill (or shake</em>) consists of the rapid alternation of two tones to the full value of the printed note. The lower of these two tones is represented by the printed note, while the upper one is the next higher tone in the diatonic scale of the key in which the composition is written. The interval between the two tones may therefore be either a half-step or a whole-step.</p><p>Whether the trill is to begin with the principal tone (represented by the printed note) or with the one above is a matter of some dispute among theorists and performers, but it may safely be said that the majority of modern writers on the subject would have it begin on the principal tone rather than on the tone above. Fig. 40.</p><p>When the principal note is preceded by a small note on the degree above, it is of course understood that the trill begins on the tone above. Fig. 41.</p></li></ol><p>The trill is indicated by the sign [trill symbol].</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 40.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 41.]</p><p>The above examples would be termed <em>perfect trills</em> because they close with a turn. By inference, an <em>imperfect trill</em> is one closing without a turn.</p><ol start="66"><li>The <em>mordent</em> [mordent symbol] consists of three tones; first the one represented by the printed note; second the one next below it in the diatonic scale; third the one represented by the printed note again.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 42.]</p><ol start="67"><li>The <em>double (or long) mordent</em> has five tones (sometimes seven) instead of three, the first two of the three tones of the regular mordent being repeated once or more. (See Fig. 43.)</li></ol><p>In the case of both mordent and double-mordent the tones are sounded as quickly as possible, the time taken by the embellishment being subtracted from the value of the principal note as printed.</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 43.]</p><ol start="68"><li>The <em>inverted mordent</em> [inverted mordent symbol] (note the absence of the vertical line) is like the mordent except that the tone below is replaced by the tone above in each case. This ornament is sometimes called a &quot;transient shake&quot; because it is really only a part of the more elaborate grace called &quot;trill.&quot; (See Fig. 44.)</li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 44.]</p><pre><code> The confusion at present attending the interpretation of the
 last two embellishments described, might be largely obviated
 if the suggestion of a recent writer[11] to call the one the
 _upward mordent_, and the other the _downward mordent_ were to
 be universally adopted.

 effects; in the case of a turn _over_ the note the turn comes
 at the beginning, but in the case of the sign _after_ the note
 the turn comes at the very end. But in both cases the time
 taken by the embellishment is taken from the time-value of
 the principal note. For further details see Grove&#39;s Dictionary

The appoggiatura is always accented, but the acciaccatura never is, the stress always falling on the melody tone. (See Grove, op. cit. Vol. I, p. 96.)</p><p>The use of embellishments is on the wane, and the student of to-day needs the above information only to aid him in the interpretation of music written in previous centuries. In the early days of instrumental music it was necessary to introduce graces of all sorts because the instruments in use were not capable of sustaining tone for any length of time; but with the advent of the modern piano with its comparatively great sustaining power, and also with the advent in vocal music of a new style of singing (German Lieder singing as contrasted with Italian coloratura singing), ornamental tones were used less and less, and when found now are usually written out in full in the score instead of being indicated by signs.</p></li></ol><p>CHAPTER VII</p><p>SCALES</p><ol start="76"><li><p>A <em>scale</em> (from <em>scala</em>, a Latin word meaning <em>ladder</em>; Ger. <em>Ton-leiter</em>) is an ascending or descending series of tones, progressing according to some definite system, and all bearing (in the case of tonality scales at least) a very intimate relation to the first tone--the <em>key-tone</em> or <em>tonic</em>. (See p. 28, Sec. 78; also note 1 at bottom of p. 38.)</p><p>Many different kinds of scales have existed in various musical eras, the point of resemblance among them all being the fact that they have all more or less recognized the <em>octave</em> as the natural limit of the series. The difference among the various scales has been in the selection of intervals between the scale-tones, and, consequently, in the number of tones within the octave. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, in our major scale the intervals between the tones are all whole-steps except two (which are half-steps), and the result is a scale of <em>eight</em> tones (including in this number both the key-tone and its octave): but in the so-called <em>pentatonic</em> scale of the Chinese and other older civilizations we find larger intervals (<em>e.g.</em>, the step-and-a-half), and consequently a smaller number of tones within the octave. Thus in the scale upon which many of the older Scotch folk songs are based the intervals are arranged as follows:</p><p>1 whole 2 whole 3 step-and- 4 whole 5 step-and- 6 step step a-half step a-half</p><p>The result is a scale of six tones, corresponding approximately with C--D--E--G--A--C in our modern system.</p><p>The term <em>pentatonic</em> is thus seen to be a misnomer since the sixth tone is necessary for the completion of the series, just as the eighth tone is essential in our diatonic scales.</p><p>The following Chinese tune (called &quot;Jasmine&quot;) is based on the pentatonic scale.</p><p>[Illustration]</p></li><li><p>In studying the theory of the scale the student should bear in mind the fact that a scale is not an arbitrary series of tones which some one has invented, and which others are required to make use of. It is rather the result of accustoming the ear to certain melodic combinations (which were originally hit upon by accident), and finally analyzing and systematizing these combinations into a certain definite order or arrangement. The application of this idea may be verified when it is recalled that most primitive peoples have invented melodies of some sort, but that only in modern times, and particularly since the development of instrumental music, have these melodies been analyzed, and the scale upon which they have been based, discovered, the inventors of the melodies being themselves wholly ignorant of the existence of such scales.</p></li><li><p>A <em>key</em> is a number of tones grouping themselves naturally (both melodically and harmonically) about a central tone--the key tone. The word <em>tonality</em> is often used synonymously with <em>key</em> in this sense.</p><p>The difference between <em>key</em> and <em>scale</em> is therefore this, that while both <em>key</em> and <em>scale</em> employ the same tone material, by <em>key</em> we mean the material in general, without any particular order or arrangement in mind, while by <em>scale</em> we mean the same tones, but now arranged into a regular ascending or descending series. It should be noted in this connection also that not all scales present an equally good opportunity of having their tones used as a basis for tonality or key-feeling: neither the chromatic nor the whole-step scale possess the necessary characteristics for being used as tonality scales in the same sense that our major and minor scales are so used.</p></li><li><p>There are <em>three general classes of scales</em> extant at the present time, viz.: (1) Diatonic; (2) Chromatic; (3) Whole-tone.[13]</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 13: If strictly logical terminology is to be insisted upon the whole-tone scale should be called the &quot;whole-step&quot; scale.]</p><ol start="80"><li><p>The word <em>diatonic</em> means &quot;through the tones&quot; (<em>i.e.</em>, through the tones of the key), and is applied to both major and minor scales of our modern tonality system. In general a diatonic scale may be defined as one which proceeds by half-steps and whole-steps. There is, however, one exception to this principle, viz., in the progression six to seven in the harmonic minor scale, which is of course a step-and-a-half. (See p. 33, Sec. 86.)</p></li><li><p>A <em>major diatonic scale</em> is one in which the intervals between the tones are arranged as follows:</p></li></ol><p>1 whole 2 whole 3 half 4 whole 5 whole 6 whole 7 half 8 step step step step step step step</p><p>In other words, a major diatonic scale is one in which the intervals between three and four, and between seven and eight are half-steps, all the others being whole-steps. A composition based on this scale is said to be written in the major mode, or in a major key. The major diatonic scale may begin on any one of the twelve pitches C, C[sharp] or D[flat], D, D[sharp] or E[flat], E, F, F[sharp] or G[flat], G, G[sharp] or A[flat], A, A[sharp] or B[flat], B, but in each case it is the same scale because the intervals between its tones are the same. We have then one major scale only, but this scale may be written in many different positions, and may be sung or played beginning on any one of a number of different pitches.</p><ol start="82"><li>It is interesting to note that the major scale consists of two identical series of four tones each; <em>i.e.</em>, the first four tones of the scale are separated from one another by exactly the same intervals and these intervals appear in exactly the same order as in the case of the last four tones of the scale. Fig. 53 will make this clear. The first four tones of any diatonic scale (major or minor) are often referred to as the <em>lower tetrachord</em>[14] and the upper four tones as the <em>upper tetrachord</em>.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 14: The word <em>tetrachord</em> means literally &quot;four strings&quot; and refers to the primitive instrument, the four strings of which were so tuned that the lowest and the highest tones produced were a perfect fourth apart. With the Greeks the tetrachord was the unit of analysis as the octave is with us to-day, and all Greek scales are capable of division into two tetrachords, the arrangement of the intervals between the tones in each tetrachord differentiating one scale from another, but the tetrachords themselves always consisting of groups of four tones, the highest being a perfect fourth above the lowest.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 53.]</p><p>It is interesting further to note that the upper tetrachord of any <em>sharp</em> scale is always used without change as the lower tetrachord of the next major scale involving sharps, while the lower tetrachord of any <em>flat</em> scale is used as the upper tetrachord of the next flat scale. See Figs. 54 and 55.</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 54.]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 55.]</p><ol start="83"><li>From the standpoint of staff notation the major scale may be written in fifteen different positions, as follows:</li></ol><p>[Illustration]</p><p>It will be observed that in the above series of scales those beginning on F[sharp] and G[flat] call for the same keys on the piano, <em>i.e.</em>, while the notation is different, the actual tones of the scale are the same. The scales of C[sharp] and D[flat] likewise employ the same tones. When two scales thus employ the same tones but differ in notation they are said to be <em>enharmonic</em>, (cf. p. 38, Sec. 93.)</p><pre><code> _Note_.--The student is advised to adopt some uniform method

This interval between the first and third tones consists of four half-steps in the major scale and of three half-steps in the minor scale and this difference in size has given rise to the designation <em>major</em> for the scale having the larger third, and <em>minor</em> for the scale having the smaller one.</p></li><li><p><em>The original (or primitive) form</em> of the minor scale has its tones arranged as follows.</p></li></ol><p>1 whole 2 half 3 whole 4 whole 5 half 6 whole 7 whole 8 step step step step step step step</p><p>As its name implies, this is the oldest of the three forms (being derived from the old Greek Aeolian scale), but because of the absence of a &quot;leading tone&quot; it is suitable for the simplest one-part music only, and is therefore little used at present.</p><ol start="86"><li><em>The harmonic minor scale</em> is like the primitive form except that it substitutes a tone one half-step higher for the seventh tone of the older (<em>i.e.</em>, the primitive) form. This change was made because the development of writing music in several parts (particularly <em>harmonic</em> part-writing) made necessary a &quot;leading tone,&quot; <em>i.e.</em>, a tone with a strong tendency to move on up to the key-tone as a closing point. In order to secure a tone with such a strongly upward tendency the interval between <em>seven</em> and <em>eight</em> had to be reduced in size to a half-step. It should be noted that this change in the seventh tone of the scale caused an interval of a step-and-a-half between the sixth and seventh tones of the scale.</li></ol><p>1 whole 2 half 3 whole 4 whole 5 half 6 step and 7 half 8 step step step step step a half step</p><ol start="87"><li><em>The melodic minor scale</em> substitutes a tone one half-step higher than six as well as one a half-step higher than seven, but this change is made in the ascending scale only, the descending scale being like the primitive form.

It will be observed that this hymn provided syllables only for the six tones of the <em>hexachord</em> then recognized; when the octave scale was adopted (early in the sixteenth century) the initial letters of the last line (s and i) were combined into a syllable for the seventh tone.</p><p>[Illustration: <em>Ut</em> que-ant lax-is <em>Re</em>-so-na-re fi-bris <em>Mi</em>-ra ges-to-rum <em>Fa</em>-mu-li tu-o-rum <em>Sol</em>-ve pol-lu-ti <em>La</em>-bi-i re-a-tum Sanc-te Jo-han-nes.]]</p><p>Major--DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA, TI, DO.</p><p>Minor[17]--original--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA. harmonic--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FA, SI, LA. melodic--LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, FI, SI, LA, SOL, FA, MI, RE, DO, TI, LA.</p><p>[Footnote 17: A considerable number of teachers (particularly those who did not learn to sing by syllable in childhood) object to calling the tonic of the minor scale <em>la</em>, insisting that both major and minor tonic should be called <em>do</em>.

Thus in the Dorian mode the tonic would be RE, in the Phrygian, MI, etc.]</p><pre><code> It is interesting to study the changes in both spelling and
 pronunciation that have occurred (and are still occurring) in
 these syllables. The first one (ut) was changed to _DO_ as
 early as the sixteenth century because of the difficulty of
 producing a good singing tone on _ut_. For the same reason and
 also in order to avoid having two diatonic syllables with the
 same initial letter, the tonic-sol-fa system (invented in
 England about 1812 and systematized about 1850) changed SI to
 TI and this change has been almost universally adopted by
 teachers of sight-singing in this country. The more elaborate
 tonic-sol-fa spelling of the diatonic syllables (DOH, LAH,
 etc.), has not, however, been favorably received in this
 country and the tendency seems to be toward still further
 simplification rather than toward elaboration. It is probable
 that further changes in both spelling and pronunciation will
 be made in the near future, one such change that seems
 especially desirable being some other syllable than RE for the
 second tone of the major scale, so that the present syllable
 may be reserved for &quot;flat-two,&quot; thus providing a uniform
 vowel-sound for all intermediate tones of the descending
 chromatic scale, as is already the case in the ascending form.
</code></pre><ol start="93"><li>The <em>chromatic scale</em>[18] is one which proceeds always by half-steps. Its intervals are therefore always equal no matter with what tone it begins. Since, however, we have (from the standpoint of the piano keyboard) five pairs of tones[19] which are enharmonically the same, it may readily be seen that the chromatic scale might be notated in all sorts of fashions, and this is in fact the real status of the matter, there being no one method uniformly agreed upon by composers.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 18: The student should differentiate between the so-called &quot;tonality&quot; scales like the major and minor, the tones of which are actually used as a basis for &quot;key-feeling&quot; with the familiar experience of coming home to the tonic after a melodic or harmonic excursion, and on the other hand the purely artificial and mechanical construction of the chromatic scale.]</p><p>[Footnote 19: Many other enharmonic notations are possible, altho the &quot;five pairs of tones&quot; above referred to are the most common. Thus E[sharp] and F are enharmonically the same, as are also C[flat] and B, C[sharp] and B[double-sharp], etc.]</p><pre><code> Parry (Grove&#39;s Dictionary, article _chromatic_) recommends
 writing the scale with such accidentals as can occur in
 chromatic chords without changing the key in which the passage
 occurs. Thus, taking C as a type, &quot;the first accidental will
 be D[flat], as the upper note of the minor ninth on the tonic;
 the next will be E[flat], the minor third of the key; the next
 F[sharp], the major third of the super-tonic--all of which can
 occur without causing modulation--and the remaining two will
 be A[flat] and B[flat], the minor sixth and seventh of the
 key.&quot; According to this plan the chromatic scale beginning
 with C would be spelled--C, D[flat], D, E[flat], E, F,
 F[sharp], G, A[flat], A, B[flat], B, C--the form being the
 same both ascending and descending. This is of course written
 exclusively from a harmonic standpoint and the advantage of
 such a form is its definiteness.
</code></pre><ol start="94"><li>For <em>sight-singing purposes</em> the chromatic scale[20] is usually written by representing the intermediate tones in ascending by sharps, (in some cases naturals and double-sharps), and the intermediate tones in descending by flats (sometimes naturals and double-flats). The chromatic scale in nine different positions, written from this standpoint, follows, and the syllables most commonly applied in sight-singing have also been added. In the first two scales the student of harmony is asked to note that because of the very common practice of modulating to the dominant and sub-dominant keys, the intermediate tones [sharp]4 and [flat]7 are quite universally used in both ascending and descending melody passages. In other words the scales that follow would more nearly represent actual usage if in each case [sharp]4 (FI) were substituted for [flat]5 (SE) in the descending scale; and if [flat]7 (TE) were substituted for [sharp]6 (LI) in the ascending form.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 20: The word <em>chromatic</em> means literally <em>colored</em> and was first applied to the intermediate tones because by using them the singer could get smoother and more diversely-shaded progressions, <em>i.e.</em>, could get more <em>color</em> than by using only the diatonic tones. Composers were not long discovering the peculiar value of these additional tones and soon found that these same tones were exceedingly valuable also in modulating, hence the two uses of intermediate tones at the present time--first, to embellish a melody; second, to modulate to another key.]</p><p>[Illustration]</p><pre><code> _Note._--In writing chromatic scales from this sight-singing
 standpoint the student is urged to adopt a three-step process;
 first, writing the major diatonic scale both ascending and
 descending; second, marking the half-steps; third, inserting
 accidental notes calling for the intermediate tones. In the
 above chromatic scales these intermediate tones have been
 represented by black note-heads so as to differentiate them
 from the notes representing diatonic scale tones.
</code></pre><ol start="95"><li><p>The <em>whole-step scale</em> (the third type mentioned in Sec. 79) is, as its name implies, a scale in which the intervals between the tones consist in every instance of whole-steps. This reduces the number of tones in the scale to seven. Beginning with C the scale reads: C, D, E, F[sharp] or G[flat], A[flat], B[flat], C. This scale has been used somewhat extensively by the ultramodern French school of composition represented by Debussy, Ravel, and others, but is not making any progress toward universal adoption. The remarks of a recent English writer[21] on this subject may be interesting to the student who is puzzled by the apparent present-day tendencies of French music. He says:</p><p>&quot;The student of some interesting modern developments will also speedily discover that the adoption of the so-called whole-tone scale as a basis of music is, except upon a keyed instrument tuned to the compromise of equal temperament, unnatural and impossible. No player upon a stringed instrument can play the scale of whole-tones and arrive at an octave which is in tune with the starting note, unless he deliberately changes one of the notes on the road and alters it while playing it. The obvious result of the application of the whole-tone scale to an orchestra or a string quartet would be to force them to adopt the equal temperament of the pianoforte, and play every interval except the octave out of tune. When this modification had taken hold all music in the pure scale would be distorted and destroyed, unless string players were to face the practically impossible drudgery of studying both the equal temperament and the pure scale from the start, and were able to tackle either form at a moment&#39;s notice. A thorough knowledge of the natural genesis of the scale of western nations will be the best antidote to fads founded upon ignorance of it. It is a curious commentary upon this question that Wagner, in the opening of the third act of <em>Tristan</em> (bars 6 to 10), experimented with the whole-tone scale and drew his pen through it, as was to be expected from a composer whose every work proves the writer to have had the pure scale inbred in him.&quot;</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 21: Stanford--Musical Composition (1911) p. 17.]</p><p>There may be some difference of opinion among acousticians as to whether Mr. Stanford is correct in his scientific assumptions regarding the difference between &quot;tempered&quot; and &quot;pure&quot; scales,[22] but even so, there is a far more potent reason why the whole-step scale will probably never become popular as the major and minor scales now are, viz., the fact that it offers no possibility of <em>inculcating tonality feeling</em>, which has always been the basis of even the simplest primitive music. Tonality scales give rise to a feeling of alternate periods of contraction and relaxation--an active tone (or chord) followed by a passive one, but no such effect is possible in the whole-step scale, and it seems suitable therefore only for that class of music whose outlines are <em>purposely intended to be</em> vague and indefinite--the impressionistic style of music writing.</p><p>[Footnote 22: Recent tests in Germany seem to prove conclusively that the <em>tempered</em> scale is the scale ordinarily employed by both vocalists and players on stringed instruments, and that the ideal of and agitation for a <em>pure</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, <em>untempered</em>) scale in vocal and in string music is somewhat of a myth.]</p><p>CHAPTER IX</p><p>AUXILIARY WORDS AND ENDINGS</p><ol start="96"><li>Being a list of articles, adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions, and endings, often utilized in compounding terms relating to musical effects.</li></ol><p><em>A</em>--preposition--variously translated to, at, for, by, in, with, towards. <em>A cappella</em>--in church style. <em>A capriccio</em>--at the fancy of the performer. <em>A deux mains</em>--for two hands. <em>A mezza voce</em>--with half voice.</p><p><em>A la</em>, or <em>alla</em>--in the manner of. <em>Alla marcia</em>--in the style of a march.</p><p><em>Assai</em>--very, or very much. <em>Allegro assai</em>--very fast.</p><p><em>Ben</em>--well. <em>Ben marcato</em>--well marked.</p><p><em>Coi, con, col, colla, colle, collo</em>--with, or with the. <em>Con amore</em>--with tenderness. <em>Colla voce</em>--with the voice.</p><p><em>Come</em>--as, like. <em>Come primo</em>--as at first.</p><p><em>Contra</em>--against.

 equally strongly, but A may subjectively group the beats
 into--_one_, two | _one_, two |--etc., while B feels the
 groups as--_one_, two, _three_, four | _one_, two, _three_,
 four |--etc. Rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing,
 inherent in the music itself, while measure is to a certain
 extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have
 adopted for practical purposes.

Syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary interruption of a normal series of accents, <em>i.e.</em>, accenting a beat that is usually not accented. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, in Fig. 56, measure <em>one</em> has the regular system of accents normally found in four-quarter-measure, (strong accent on one, secondary accent on three); but measure <em>three</em> has only one accent, and it falls on the second beat.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 56.]</p><ol start="99"><li><p>Measures are usually classified as <em>simple</em> and <em>compound</em>. A <em>simple measure</em> is one which has but a single accent, <em>i.e.</em>, the measure cannot be divided into smaller constituent groups. There are two main classes of simple measures, two-beat measure, and three-beat measure. A <em>compound measure</em> is (as its name implies) one made up by combining two or more simple measures, or by the elaboration of a single measure (in slow tempo) into several constituent groups. The principal compound measures are four-beat and six-beat, both being referred to as compound-duple measures. Five-beat, seven-beat, nine-beat, and twelve-beat measures are also classified as compound measures.</p><p>An English writer[23] classifies measures as duple, triple, or quadruple, specifying that a simple measure is one in which each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided into halves ([Illustration] etc.) and that a compound measure is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted-note, whose value can be divided into three parts, ([Illustration]). There is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words <em>simple</em> and <em>compound</em> when applied in this connection, the principal question at issue being whether four-beat measure is an individual variety, or whether it is a variety compounded out of two-beat measures, either by placing two of these in a group or by the elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats, as is often necessary in slow tempi. Perhaps the easiest way out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true--but in different compositions. That is, it is frequently impossible to tell whether a composition that is being listened to is in two-beat, or in four-beat measure; and yet it <em>is</em> sometimes possible so to discriminate. Since, however, one cannot in the majority of cases distinguish between two-beat and four-beat measures, it will probably be best to leave the original classification intact and regard four-beat measure as a compound variety.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 23: Pearse--Rudiments of Musical Knowledge, p. 37.]</p><ol start="100"><li><p>The <em>commonest varieties of measure</em> are:</p><ol><li><em>Duple</em> (sometimes called even measure, or even time), in which there are two beats, the first one being accented. Examples of duple measure are 2/4, 2/8, 2/2, two-quarter,[24] two-eighth, and two-half measure, respectively.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 24: For explanation of terminology, see p. 48, Sec. 106.]</p><ol start="2"><li><p><em>Triple</em>, (the old perfect measure), in which there are three beats, the first one being accented, the second and third unaccented. Examples are 3/8, 3/4, 3/2, three-eighth, three-quarter, and three-half measure, respectively.</p></li><li><p><em>Quadruple</em>, in which there are four beats, the first and third being accented (primary accent on <em>one</em>, secondary accent on <em>three</em>), the second and fourth unaccented. (See note above, under Sec. 99.)</p></li><li><p><em>Sextuple</em>, in which there are six beats, the first and fourth being accented, the others not. In rapid tempi this is always taken as compound duple measure, a dotted quarter note having a beat. It will be noted that the two measures [Illustration] are identical in effect with [Illustration].</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Other varieties of measure sometimes found are 9/8 and 12/8, but these are practically always taken as three-beat and four-beat measures respectively, being equivalent to these if each group of three tones is thought of as a triplet. [Illustration] is identical in effect with [Illustration].</p></li><li><p><em>Quintuple</em> (five-beat) and <em>septuple</em> (seven-beat) measures are occasionally met with, but these are rare and will always be sporadic. The five-beat measure is taken as a combination of three and two, or of two and three (sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition), while the seven-beat measure is taken in groups of four and three, or of three and four.</p></li><li><p>The sign [common-time symbol] is usually understood to mean four-quarter measure, and the sign [cut-time symbol], two-half measure, but usage varies somewhat, and the second sign is sometimes used to indicate four-half measure. It may safely be said however that the sign [cut-time symbol] always indicates that a half-note has a beat. [Double cut-time symbol] may occasionally be found indicating four-half measure but this is rare.</p><p>The student will note that the sign [common-time symbol] is not a <em>letter</em> C, but an incomplete circle, differentiating two-beat (imperfect) measure from three-beat (perfect) measure.

Such changes may cause some confusion at first, but seem to be necessary if our musical terminology is to be at all exact.</p><ol start="105"><li><p>The <em>first of the changes</em> mentioned in the above paragraph is to substitute the word <em>rhythm</em> for the word <em>time</em> when correcting mistakes involving misplaced accent, etc. <em>E.g.</em>, &quot;Your <em>rhythm</em> in the third measure of the lower score was wrong,&quot; instead of &quot;Your <em>time</em>--was wrong.&quot;</p></li><li><p>The <em>second change</em> mentioned would eliminate such blind and misleading expressions as &quot;two-four time,&quot; &quot;three-four time,&quot; &quot;four-four time,&quot; &quot;six-eight time,&quot; etc., and substitute therefor such self-explanatory designations as &quot;two-quarter measure,&quot; &quot;three-quarter measure,&quot; &quot;four-quarter measure,&quot; &quot;six-eighth measure,&quot; etc. <em>E.g.</em>, &quot;The first movement of the Beethoven Sonata Op. 2, No. 3, is in <em>four-quarter measure</em>.&quot;</p></li><li><p>The <em>third change</em> referred to above would substitute the word <em>tempo</em> (plural--<em>tempi</em>) for the word <em>time</em> in all allusions to rate of speed. <em>E.g.</em>, &quot;The scherzo was played in very rapid <em>tempo</em>.&quot;</p><p>The word <em>tempo</em> has been used in this connection so long by professional musicians that there can be no possible objection to it on the ground of its being a foreign word. In fact there is a decided advantage in having a word that is understood in all countries where modern music (<em>i.e.</em>, civilized music) is performed, and just here is found the principal reason for the popularity of the Italian language in musical terminology. Schumann, MacDowell and other well known composers have tried to break down this popularity by using their own respective vernaculars in both tempo and dynamic indications, but in spite of these attempts the Italian language is still quite universally used for this purpose, and deservedly so, for if we are to have a <em>music notation</em> that is universal, so that an American is able to play music written by a Frenchman or a German, or a Russian, then we ought also to have a certain number of expressions referring to tempo, etc., which will be understood by all, <em>i.e.</em>, a music terminology that is universal. The Italian language was the first in the field, is the most universally known in this particular at the present time, and is entirely adequate. It should therefore be retained in use as a sort of musical Esperanto.</p></li><li><p>There are several <em>ways of finding the correct tempo</em> of a composition:</p><ol><li>From the metronomic indication found at the beginning of many compositions. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, the mark M.M. 92 (Maelzel&#39;s Metronome 92) means that if the metronome (either Maelzel&#39;s or some other reliable make) is set with the sliding weight at the figure 92 there will be 92 clicks per minute, and they will serve to indicate to the player or singer the rate at which the beats (or pulses) should follow one another. This is undoubtedly the most accurate means of determining tempi in spite of slight inaccuracies in metronomes[25] and of the mistakes which composers themselves often make in giving metronomic indications.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 25: To test the accuracy of a metronome, set the weight at 60 and see if it beats seconds. If it gives more than 62 or 63 or less than 57 or 58 clicks per minute it will not be of much service in giving correct tempi and should be taken to a jeweller to be regulated.]</p><ol start="2"><li><p>Another means of determining the tempo of a composition is to play it at different tempi and then to choose the one that &quot;feels right&quot; for that particular piece of music. This is perhaps the best means of getting at the correct tempo but is open only to the musician of long experience, sure judgment, and sound scholarship.</p></li><li><p>A third method of finding tempi is through the interpretation of certain words used quite universally by composers to indicate the approximate rate of speed and the general mood of compositions. The difficulty with this method is that one can hardly find two composers who employ the same word to indicate the same tempo, so that no absolute rate of speed can be indicated, and in the last analysis the conductor or performer must fall back on the second method cited above--<em>i.e.</em>, individual judgment.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>In spite of the inexactness of use in the case of expressions relating to tempo, these expressions are nevertheless extremely useful in giving at least a hint of what was in the composer&#39;s mind as he conceived the music that we are trying to interpret. Since a number of the terms overlap in meaning, and since the meaning of no single term is absolute, these expressions relating to tempo are best studied in groups. Perhaps the most convenient grouping is as follows:</p><ol><li><p><em>Grave</em> (lit. weighty, serious), <em>larghissimo</em>, <em>adagissimo</em>, and <em>lentissimo</em>--indicating the very slowest tempo used in rendering music.</p></li><li><p><em>Largo</em>,[26] <em>adagio</em>,[27] and <em>lento</em>--indicating quite a slow tempo.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 26: Largo, larghetto, etc., are derivatives of the Latin word <em>largus</em>, meaning large, broad.]</p><p>[Footnote 27: Adagio means literally at ease.]</p><ol start="3"><li><p><em>Larghetto</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, <em>a little largo</em>) and <em>adagietto</em> (<em>a little adagio</em>)--a slow tempo, but not quite so slow as <em>largo</em>, etc.</p></li><li><p><em>Andante</em> (going, or walking, as contrasted with running) and <em>andantino</em>--indicating a moderately slow tempo.</p></li></ol><p><em>Andantino</em> is now quite universally taken slightly faster than <em>andante</em>, in spite of the fact that if <em>andante</em> means &quot;going,&quot; and if &quot;<em>ino</em>&quot; is the diminutive ending, then <em>andantino</em> means &quot;going less,&quot; <em>i.e.</em>, more slowly!</p><ol start="5"><li><p><em>Moderato</em>--a moderate tempo.</p></li><li><p><em>Allegro</em> and <em>allegretto</em>[28]--a moderately quick tempo, <em>allegretto</em> being usually interpreted as meaning a tempo somewhat slower than <em>allegro</em>.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 28: There has been some difference of opinion as to which of these two terms indicates the more rapid tempo: an analysis tells us that if <em>allegro</em> means quick, and if <em>etto</em> is the diminutive ending, then <em>allegretto</em> means a little quick--<em>i.e.</em>, slower than <em>allegro</em>. These two terms are, however, so closely allied in meaning that a dispute over the matter is a mere waste of breath.]</p><p>The word <em>allegro</em> means literally happy, joyous, and this literal meaning is still <em>sometimes</em> applicable, but in the majority of instances the term refers only to rate of speed.</p><ol start="7"><li><p><em>Vivo</em>, <em>vivace</em>, (lit. lively)--a tempo between <em>allegro</em> and <em>presto</em>.</p></li><li><p><em>Presto</em>, <em>prestissimo</em>, <em>vivacissimo</em>, and <em>prestissimo possibile</em>--the most rapid tempo possible.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>CHAPTER XII</p><p>TEMPO (<em>Continued</em>)</p><ol start="110"><li><p>Innumerable combinations of the words defined in Sec. 109 with one another and with other words occur.

 2. Terms indicating a tempo which is to become definitely
 slower _at once_.

 _Piu lento_ (lit. more slowly), _meno mosso_ (lit. less
 movement).

 3. Terms indicating a slower tempo combined with an increase
 in power.

 _Largando_, _allargando._ These words are both derived from
 _largo_, meaning large, broad.

 as given above: the terms in group 1 indicate that each
 measure, and even each pulse in the measure, is a little
 slower than the preceding one, while such terms as _piu lento_
 and _meno mosso_ indicate a rate of speed becoming instantly
 slower and extending over an entire phrase or passage. Some
 composers (_e.g._, Beethoven and Couperin) have evidently had
 this same distinction in mind between _rallentando_ and
 _ritardando_ on the one hand, and _ritenuto_ and _ritenente_
 on the other, considering the former (_rall._ and _rit._) to
 indicate a gradually slackening speed, and the latter
 (_ritenuto_ and _ritenente_) to indicate a definitely slower
 rate. The majority of composers do not however differentiate
 between them in this way, and it will therefore hardly be
 worth while for the student to try to remember the
 distinction.

These words are abbreviated as follows:--<em>sf</em>,<em>fz</em>, and <em>sfz</em>, the abbreviation being placed directly above (sometimes below) the note or chord affected. The signs [vertical accent symbol] and [horizontal accent symbol] are also commonly used to indicate such an accent.</p><p>In interpreting these accent marks the student must bear in mind again the fact that they have a relative rather than an absolute meaning: the mark <em>sf</em> occurring in the midst of a <em>piano</em> passage will indicate a much milder form of accent than would the same mark occurring in the midst of a <em>forte</em> passage.</p></li><li><p>The words <em>rinforzando</em> and <em>rinforzato</em> (abb.--<em>rinf.</em> and <em>rfz.</em>) mean literally <em>reinforced</em>, and are used to indicate a sudden increase in power usually extending over an entire phrase or passage instead of applying only to a single tone or chord as in the case of <em>sforzando</em>, etc.</p></li><li><p><em>Crescendo</em> (abb.--<em>cresc.</em> or [crescendo symbol]) means a gradual increase in power.

The first variety is possible only on instruments giving forth a tone which can be varied <em>after it begins</em>. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, the human voice, the violin, the organ enclosed in a swell box, and certain wind instruments, are all capable of sounding a tone softly at first and gradually increasing the volume until the maximal point of power has been reached. But on the piano, organ not enclosed in a swell-box, kettle drum, etc., the power of the tone cannot be varied after the tone has once been sounded, and a <em>crescendo</em> effect is therefore possible only in a <em>passage</em>, in rendering which each succeeding tone is struck more forcibly than its immediate predecessor. This second variety of <em>crescendo</em> offers a means of dramatic effect which may be employed most strikingly, as <em>e.g.</em>, when a long passage begins very softly and increases in power little by little until the utmost resources of the instrument or orchestra have been reached. A notable example of such an effect is found in the transition from the third to the fourth movements of the Beethoven Fifth Symphony.</p><pre><code> The difference between _sforzando_, _rinforzando_, and
 _crescendo_ should now be noted: _sforzando_ indicates that a
 single tone or chord is to be louder; _rinforzando_, that an
 entire passage is to be louder, beginning with its first tone;
 but _crescendo_ indicates that there is to be a gradual
 increase in power, this increase sometimes occurring during
 the sounding of a single tone, but more often in a passage.

The damper on the piano does not in any way correspond to the mute thus used on stringed instruments, and the terms above explained as sometimes occurring in piano music are not to be recommended, even though Beethoven used them in this sense in all his earlier sonatas.</p></li><li><p>The words <em>una corda</em> (lit.--one string) indicate that the &quot;soft pedal&quot; (the one at the left) is to be depressed, while the words <em>tre corde</em> (lit. three strings) or <em>tutte le corde</em> (all the strings) show that the same pedal is to be released. These expressions refer to the fact that on grand pianos the &quot;soft pedal&quot; when depressed moves the hammers to one side so that instead of striking three strings they strike only two (in the older pianos only one, hence <em>una corda</em>), all three strings (<em>tre corde</em>) being struck again after the release of the pedal.</p></li><li><p>Other terms relating either directly or indirectly to the subject of dynamics are:</p><p><em>Con alcuna licenza</em>--with some degree of license.</p><p><em>Con amore</em>--with tenderness.</p><p><em>Con bravura</em>--with boldness.</p><p><em>Con celerita</em>--with rapidity.</p><p><em>Con delicato</em>--with delicacy.</p><p><em>Con energico</em>--with energy.</p><p><em>Con espressione</em>--with expression.</p><p><em>Con forza</em>--with force.</p><p><em>Con fuoco</em>--with fire and passion.</p><p><em>Con grand&#39; espressione</em>--with great expression.</p><p><em>Con grazia</em>--with grace.</p><p><em>Con melinconia</em>--with melancholy.

Thus <em>e.g.</em>, although every fugue is different from all other fugues in actual material, yet the arrangement of the various parts is so characteristic that no one who knows the <em>fugue form</em> has any doubt as to what kind of a composition he is hearing whenever a fugue is played. The word <em>form</em> is therefore seen to be somewhat synonymous with the word <em>plan</em> as used in architecture; it is the structure or design underlying music. Examples of form are the canon, the fugue, the sonata, etc.</p><p>Speaking broadly we may say that <em>form</em> in any art consists in the placing together of certain parts in such relations of proportion and symmetry as to make a unified whole. In music this implies unity of tonality and of general rhythmic effect, as well as unity in the grouping of the various parts of the work (phrases, periods, movements) so as to weld them into one whole, giving the impression of completeness to the hearer.</p></li><li><p>The primal <em>basis of form</em> is the repetition of some characteristic effect, and the problem of the composer is to bring about these repetitions in such a way that the ear will recognize them as being the same material and will nevertheless not grow weary of them. This is accomplished by varying the material (cf. thematic development), by introducing contrasting material, and by choice of key.</p></li><li><p>The student should note at the outset of this topic the <em>difference in meaning between</em> the terms <em>form</em> and <em>style</em>: A <em>form</em> is a plan for building a certain definite kind of composition, but a <em>style</em> is merely a manner of writing. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, the <em>fugue</em> is a <em>form</em>--<em>i.e.</em>, it is a plan, which although capable of variation in details, is yet carried out fairly definitely in every case; but <em>counterpoint</em> is merely a <em>style</em> or manner of writing (just as Gothic architecture is a style of building), which may be cast into any one of several <em>forms</em>.</p></li><li><p>The material found in the following sections is an attempt to explain in simple language certain terms relating to <em>forms</em> and <em>styles</em> which are in common use; in many cases the definition is too meagre to give anything but a very general idea, but it is hoped that the student will at least be set to thinking and that he will eventually be led to a more detailed and scholarly study of the subject. (The article &quot;Form&quot; and the separate articles under each term here defined, as found in Grove&#39;s Dictionary, are especially recommended. For examples of the various forms described, see also Mason and Surette--&quot;The Appreciation of Music,&quot; Supplementary Volume.)</p></li><li><p>In a very general way there may be said to be <em>two styles of musical composition</em>, the monophonic (or homophonic)--the one-voiced--and the polyphonic--the many voiced. The polyphonic[32] style antedates the monophonic historically.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 32: Polyphonic music flourished from 1000 A.D. to about 1750 A.D., the culmination of the polyphonic period being reached in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and the later writers have used the monophonic style more than the polyphonic, although a combination of the two is often found, as <em>e.g.</em>, in the later works of Beethoven.]</p><ol start="137"><li><p>In <em>monophonic music</em> there is one voice which has a pronounced melody, the other voices (if present) supporting this melody as a harmonic (and often rhythmic) background. An example of this is the ordinary hymn-tune with its melody in the highest part, and with three other voices forming a &quot;four-part harmony.&quot; The sonata, symphony, opera, modern piano piece, etc., are also largely <em>monophonic</em>, though polyphonic passages by way of contrast are often to be found.</p></li><li><p>In <em>polyphonic music</em> each voice is to a certain extent melodically interesting, and the &quot;harmony&quot; is the result of combining several melodies in such a way as to give a pleasing effect, instead of treating a melody by adding chords as an accompaniment or support. Counterpoint, canon, round, fugue, etc., are all <em>polyphonic</em> in style. The word <em>contrapuntal</em> is often used synonymously with <em>polyphonic</em>.</p><p>(Sections 139 to 143 relate especially to terms describing polyphonic music.)</p></li><li><p><em>Counterpoint</em> is the art of adding one or more parts or melodies to a given melody, the latter being known as the &quot;cantus firmus,&quot; or subject. It may therefore be broadly defined as &quot;the art of combining melodies.&quot;</p><p>The word <em>counterpoint</em> comes from the three words &quot;<em>punctus contra punctum</em>,&quot; meaning &quot;point against point.&quot; The word point as here used refers to the <em>punctus</em>--one of the neumae of the mediaeval system, these neumae being the immediate predecessors of modern notes.</p><p>Both vocal and instrumental music have been written in contrapuntal style. The familiar two- and three-part &quot;inventions&quot; by Bach are excellent examples of instrumental counterpoint, while such choruses as those in &quot;The Messiah&quot; by Handel illustrate the highest type of vocal counterpoint.</p></li><li><p><em>Imitation</em> is the repetition by one part, of a subject or theme previously introduced by another part. If the imitation is exact, the term <em>strict imitation</em> is applied, but if only approximate, then the term <em>free imitation</em> is used in referring to it. The repetition need not have the exact pitches of the subject in order to be <em>strict</em>; on the contrary the imitation is usually at the interval of an octave, or a fifth, or a second, etc. Fig. 57 shows an example of strict imitation in which the <em>third</em> part comes in an octave <em>lower</em> than the first part.</p></li><li><p>A <em>canon</em> is a contrapuntal composition in the style of strict imitation, one part repeating exactly (but at any interval) what another part has played or sung. The term &quot;canonic style&quot; is sometimes applied to music in which the imitation is not exact. An example of three-part canon is given in Fig. 57.</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: CANON IN THREE VOICES, IN THE UNISON AND OCTAVE</p><p>Fig. 57. MOZART]</p><pre><code> The word _canon_ means _law_, and was applied to this
 particular form of composition because the rules relating to
 its composition were invariable. It is because of this
 non-flexibility that the _canon_ is so little used as a form
 at the present time: the modern composer demands a plan of
 writing that is capable of being varied to such an extent as
 to give him room for the exercise of his own particular
 individuality of conception, and this the _canon_ does not do.
 For this same reason too the fugue and the sonata have
 successively gone out of fashion and from Schumann down to the
 present time composers have as it were created their own
 forms, the difficulty in listening arising from the fact that
 no one but the composer himself could recognize the form _as_
 a form because it had not been adopted to a great enough
 extent by other composers to make it in any sense universal.
 The result is that in much present-day music it is very
 difficult for the hearer to discover any trace of familiar
 design, and the impression made by such music is in
 consequence much less definite than that made by music of the
 classic school. It is probable that a reaction from this state
 of affairs will come in the near future, for in any art it is
 necessary that there should be at least enough semblance of
 structure to make the art work capable of standing as a
 universal thing rather than as the mere temporary expression
 of some particular composer or of some period of composition.
</code></pre><ol start="142"><li><p>The common <em>school round</em> is an example of canon, each voice repeating exactly what the first voice has sung, while this first voice is going on with its melody. The <em>round</em> is therefore defined as a variety of canon in which the imitation is always in unison with the subject.</p></li><li><p>The <em>fugue</em> (Latin, <em>fuga</em> = flight) is a form of contrapuntal composition in which the imitation is always in the dominant key, <em>i.e.</em>, a fifth above or a fourth below. The imitation (called &quot;the answer&quot;) may be an exact repetition of the subject (sometimes called &quot;the question&quot;), but is usually not so.</p><p>The <em>fugue</em> differs from the canon also in that the subject is given in complete form before the answer begins, while in the canon the imitation begins while the subject is still going on. The <em>fugue</em> is not nearly so strict in form as the canon and gives the composer much greater opportunity for expressing musical ideas. A canon may be perfect in <em>form</em> and yet be very poor music; this same statement might of course be made about any form, but is especially true in the stricter ones.</p></li></ol><p>CHAPTER XV</p><p>TERMS RELATING TO FORMS AND STYLES (<em>Continued</em>)</p><pre><code> (Sections 144 to 160 relate particularly to terms used in
 descriptions of _monophonic_ music[33].)
</code></pre><p>[Footnote 33: There is a very pronounced disagreement among theorists as to what terms are to be used in referring to certain forms and parts of forms and it seems impossible to make a compromise that will satisfy even a reasonable number. In order to make the material in this chapter consistent with itself therefore it has been thought best by the author to follow the terminology of some single recognized work on form, and the general plan of monophonic form here given is therefore that of the volume called <em>Musical Form</em>, by Bussler-Cornell.]</p><ol start="144"><li><p>A <em>phrase</em> is a short musical thought (at least two measures in length) closing with either a complete or an incomplete cadence. The typical <em>phrase</em> is four measures long. The two-measure <em>phrase</em> is often called <em>section</em>. The word <em>phrase</em> as used in music terminology corresponds with the same word as used in language study.</p></li><li><p>A <em>period</em> is a little piece of music typically eight measures long, either complete in itself or forming one of the clearly defined divisions of a larger form. The <em>period</em> (when complete in itself) is the smallest monophonic form.</p></li></ol><p>The essential characteristic of the <em>regular period</em> is the fact that it usually consists of two balanced phrases (often called <em>antecedent</em> and <em>consequent</em> or <em>thesis</em> and <em>antithesis</em>), the first phrase giving rise to the feeling of incompleteness (by means of a cadence in another key, deceptive cadence, etc.,) the second phrase giving the effect of completeness by means of a definite cadence at the close.</p><pre><code> The second half of the period is sometimes a literal
 repetition of the first half, in all respects except the
 cadence, but in many cases too it is a repetition of only one
 of the elements--rhythm, intervals, or general outline. Figs.
 58 and 59 show examples of both types. The principle almost
 invariably holds that the simpler the music (cf. folk-tunes)
 the more obvious the form of the period, while the more
 complex the music, the less regular the period.
</code></pre><p>[Illustration: Fig. 58. MOZART]</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 59. SCHUBERT]</p><ol start="146"><li>The <em>primary forms</em> are built up by combining two or more periods.</li></ol><p>The <em>small two-part primary form</em> (often called <em>song-form</em> or <em>Lied-form</em>) consists of two periods so placed that the second constitutes a consequent or antithesis to the first. The second half of this second period is often exactly the same as the second half of the first period, thus binding the two periods together into absolute unity. The theme of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony (Beethoven) quoted below is a perfect example of this form. Other examples are &quot;Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes,&quot; and &quot;The Last Rose of Summer.&quot;</p><p>[Illustration: BEETHOVEN]</p><p>The <em>small three-part primary form</em> is like the two-part primary form except that it has a section of contrasting material interpolated between the two periods. This middle part is usually an eight-measure phrase.</p><p>The <em>large two- and three-part primary forms</em> usually have sixteen-measure periods instead of eight-measure ones, but are otherwise similar in construction.</p><pre><code> These various _primary forms_ are used in constructing many
 varieties of compositions, among them the _theme and
 variations_, the _polka_, the _waltz_, the _march_, etc., as
 well as most of the shorter movements in sonatas, quartets,
 etc. They are used in vocal music also, but are less apt to be
 regular here because the form of vocal music is largely
 dependent upon the structure of the text.
</code></pre><ol start="147"><li><p>A <em>theme</em> is a fragment of melody used as the subject of a fugue, as the basis of the development section in &quot;sonata form,&quot; etc. Sometimes it is a complete tune (often in period form), on which variations are made, as <em>e.g.</em>, in the familiar <em>theme and variations</em>.</p></li><li><p><em>Thematic development</em> consists in taking a short theme (or several short themes) and by means of transposition, interval expansion and contraction, rhythmic augmentation and diminution, inversion, tonality changes, etc., building out of it a lengthy composition or section of a composition. Fig. 60 <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>e</em>, and <em>f</em> show how the theme given in Fig. 60 (<em>a</em>) may be varied in a few of these ways. There are hundreds of other fashions in which this same theme might be varied without destroying its identity. For other examples of thematic development see the development section of Sonata Op. 31, No. 3, as analyzed in Appendix E. [Transcriber&#39;s Note: Corrected error &quot;Sec. 3&quot; in original.]</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 60.]</p><pre><code> For further illustrations of development in the case of this
 same theme, see--Christiani--The Principles of Expression in
 Pianoforte playing, p. 144, ff. from which the foregoing
 themes have been adapted.
</code></pre><ol start="149"><li>A <em>rondo</em> is an instrumental composition (in homophonic style) in which a certain theme appears several times almost always in the same form (<em>i.e.</em>, not thematically varied), the repetitions of this theme being separated by contrasting material.</li></ol><p>The <em>rondo</em> is the oldest of the larger monophonic forms and has been used in many different ways, but perhaps its most characteristic construction is as follows: (1) Principal subject; (2) second subject in dominant key; (3) principal subject; (4) third subject; (5) first subject again; (6) second subject, in <em>tonic key</em>; (7) coda (or ending).</p><p>The student should note particularly the problem of repetition and contrast (mentioned in Sec. 134) as here worked out, as the rondo was the first monophonic form in which this matter was at all satisfactorily solved, and its construction is especially interesting because it is readily seen to be one of the direct predecessors of the highest form of all--the sonata. Examples of rondos may be found in any volume of sonatas or sonatinas.</p><ol start="150"><li><p>A <em>suite</em> is a set of instrumental dances all in the same or in nearly related keys. The first dance is usually preceded by an introduction or prelude, and the various dances are so grouped as to secure contrast of movement--a quick dance being usually followed by a slower one.</p><p>The suite is interesting to students of the development of music as being the first form <em>in several movements</em> to be generally adopted by composers. It retained its popularity from the beginning of the seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth centuries, being finally displaced by the sonata, whose immediate predecessor it is thus seen to be.</p></li></ol><p>The <em>suite</em> was formerly written for solo instrument only (harpsichord, clavichord, piano) but modern composers like Dvo[vr]ak, Lachner, Moszkowski, and others have written suites for full orchestra also.</p><ol start="151"><li><p>Among the dances commonly found in suites are the following:</p><p><em>Allemande</em>--duple or quadruple measure.</p><p><em>Bolero</em>--triple measure.</p><p><em>Bouree</em>--duple or quadruple measure.</p><p><em>Chaconne</em>--triple measure.</p><p><em>Courante</em>--a very old dance in triple measure.</p><p><em>Csardas</em>--Hungarian dance in duple or quadruple measure.</p><p><em>Gavotte</em>--quadruple measure.</p><p><em>Gigue</em> (or <em>jig</em>)--duple measure.</p><p><em>Habanera</em>--Spanish dance in triple measure.</p><p><em>Minuet</em>--slow dance in triple measure.</p><p><em>Mazurka</em>--Polish dance in triple measure.</p><p><em>Polonaise</em>--Polish dance in triple measure.</p><p><em>Rigaudon</em>--lively dance in duple or triple measure.</p><p><em>Sarabande</em>--triple measure.</p><p><em>Tarantella</em>--swift Italian dance in sextuple measure.</p></li></ol><p>The <em>allemande</em> is especially interesting to students of music form because of its relation to the sonata, it being the prototype of the sonata-allegro (<em>i.e.</em>, the first movement of the sonata). The <em>sarabande</em> and <em>courante</em> are likewise interesting as the prototypes of the second movement, and the <em>bouree</em>, <em>minuet</em>, etc., for their connection with the third movement.</p><ol start="152"><li><p>The <em>scherzo</em> (lit. musical joke) is a fanciful instrumental composition. It was used by Beethoven as the third movement of the sonata instead of the more limited minuet, but is also often found as an independent piece.</p></li><li><p>A <em>sonata</em> is an instrumental composition of three or more movements (usually four), the first and last of which are almost always in rapid tempo. Each of these movements is a piece of music with a unity of its own, but they are all merged together in a larger whole with a broad underlying unity of larger scope. The composition receives its name from the fact that its first movement is cast in <em>sonata-form</em>. (See Sec. 157 for description of sonata-form.)</p></li></ol><p>When the <em>sonata</em> has four movements, these are usually arranged as follows:</p><pre><code> 1. A quick movement (_allegro_, _presto_, etc.), often
 preceded by a slower introduction.

 2. A slow movement (_largo_, _andante_, _adagio_, etc.).

 3. A minuet or scherzo, often with a trio added, in which case
 the part preceding the trio is repeated after the trio is
 played.

 4. A quick movement--the finale, sometimes a rondo, sometimes
 another sonata-form, sometimes a theme with variations.
</code></pre><p>These movements are all in closely related keys, but in a variety of contrasting rhythms.</p><ol start="154"><li>A <em>trio</em> is a sonata for three instruments (such as piano, violin, and cello), while a <em>quartet</em> is a sonata for four instruments, the most common quartet combination being as follows: First and second violins, viola, and violoncello.</li></ol><p>The term <em>chamber music</em> is often applied to instrumental music for trio, quartet, quintet, and other similar combinations which are suitable for a small room rather than for a large concert hall.</p><pre><code> The words _trio_ and _quartet_ are also applied to vocal works
 for three and four voices respectively, these having no
 relation whatsoever to the sonata as described above. The word
 _trio_ is also applied to the middle section of minuets,
 scherzas, marches, etc., the term originating in the old usage
 of writing this part for three instruments only.
</code></pre><ol start="155"><li><p>A <em>concerto</em> is a sonata for a solo instrument with orchestral accompaniment, the form being usually somewhat modified so as to adapt it to a composition in which there must necessarily be opportunity for a good deal of technical display. There are usually but three movements in the <em>concerto</em>.</p><p>The great majority of <em>concertos</em> are for piano and orchestra, but examples of concertos for violin, cello, flute, oboe, and other solo instruments (all with orchestral accompaniment) have also been written. A few modern composers have applied the term <em>concerto</em> to certain large organ works (with no orchestral accompaniment, the composition being written for just the one instrument), but this use of the word is so contrary to the accepted definition that it is hardly justifiable.</p><p>When a concerto is played on two pianos (without orchestra), this does not mean that there is no orchestral part, but that there is no orchestra to play it, and so the parts that should be played by the orchestral instruments have simply been arranged for a second piano (sometimes organ).</p></li><li><p>A <em>symphony</em> is a sonata for full orchestra. In general its construction is the same as that of the sonata, but it is usually of much larger proportions and has in it much greater variety of both tonal and rhythmic material. The symphony is generally conceded to be the highest type of instrumental music ever evolved.</p><p>The <em>symphony</em> was accepted as a standard form in the time of Haydn (1732-1809) and was developed enormously by Haydn himself, Mozart (1756-1791), and Beethoven (1770-1827), reaching perhaps its highest point in the famous &quot;Nine Symphonies&quot; of the last-named composer. Later symphony writers whose works are at present being performed include Schumann, Tschaikowsky, and Dvo[vr]ak.</p></li></ol><p>The word <em>symphony</em> was formerly used synonymously with <em>ritornelle</em>, both words being applied to instrumental interludes between parts of vocal works, but this usage has now entirely disappeared.</p><ol start="157"><li><p><em>Sonata-form</em> (sometimes called <em>sonata-allegro</em>) is a plan for the construction of instrumental music (sonatas, quartets, symphonies, etc.), in which three rather definite divisions always occur, the third division being a more or less literal repetition of the first.</p><p>These <em>three parts of sonata-form</em> with their usual subdivisions are:</p><p>I. EXPOSITION</p><p>(1) Principal theme (or first subject).</p><p>(2) Link-episode (or modulation group).</p><p>(3) Secondary theme (or song group), always in a nearly related key.</p><p>(4) Closing group.</p><p>(5) Coda.</p><p>II. DEVELOPMENT SECTION</p><p>Treating the themes introduced in the exposition in an almost infinite variety of fashions, according to the principles of thematic development. (See Sec. 148).</p><p>III. RECAPITULATION (OR REPRISE)</p><p>Consisting essentially of the same subdivisions found in the <em>exposition</em>, but differing from this first section in one essential point, viz., that instead of stating the secondary theme in a <em>related</em> key, the entire recapitulation is in the <em>principal</em> key. This third section is always followed by a coda (which may either be very short or quite extended), bringing the whole movement to a more definite close.</p><p>The second part of <em>sonata-form</em> (the development section) is sometimes the longest and most intricate of the three divisions, and it is at this point that the composer has an opportunity of displaying to the full his originality and inventive skill. It is principally because of this development section that the sonata is so far superior as a <em>form</em> to its predecessors. For an analyzed example of <em>sonata-form</em>, see Appendix E. The student is advised to take other sonatas and go through the first movements with a view to finding at least the three main divisions mentioned above. In some cases the form will of course be so irregular that all the parts indicated cannot be discovered, but the general outlines of the scheme will always be present.</p></li><li><p>A <em>sonatina</em>, as its name implies, is a little sonata. It differs from the sonata proper principally in having little or no development, the second section being of slight importance as compared with the corresponding section of a sonata.</p></li></ol><p>A <em>grand sonata</em> is like an ordinary sonata in form, but is of unusually large dimensions.</p><ol start="159"><li><p><em>Program music</em> is instrumental music which is supposed to convey to the listener an image or a succession of images that will arouse in him certain emotions which have been previously aroused in the composer&#39;s mind by some scene, event, or idea. The clue to the general idea is usually given at the beginning of the music in the form of a poem or a short description of the thing in the mind of the composer, but there are many examples in which there is no clue whatsoever except the title of the composition.</p><p><em>Program music</em> represents a mean between <em>pure music</em> (cf. the piano sonata or the string quartet) on the one hand, and <em>descriptive music</em> (in which actual imitations of bird-calls, whistles, the blowing of the wind, the galloping of horses, the rolling of thunder, etc., occur), on the other. Most program music is written for the orchestra, examples being Liszt&#39;s &quot;The Preludes,&quot; Strauss&#39; &quot;Till Eulenspiegel,&quot; etc.</p></li><li><p>A <em>symphonic poem</em> (or <em>tone poem</em>) is an orchestral composition of large dimensions (resembling the symphony in size), usually embodying the program idea. It has no prescribed form and seems indeed to be often characterized by an almost total lack of design, but there are also examples of symphonic poems in which the same theme runs throughout the entire composition, being adapted at the various points at which it occurs to the particular moods expressed by the <em>program</em> at those points.</p><p>The <em>symphonic poem</em> was invented by Liszt (1811-1886) and has since been used extensively by Strauss, Saint-Saens and others. It came into existence as a part of the general movement which has caused the fugue and the sonata successively to go out of fashion, viz., the tendency to invent forms which would not hamper the composer in any way, but would leave him absolutely free to express his ideas in his own individual way.</p></li></ol><p>CHAPTER XVI</p><p>TERMS RELATING TO VOCAL MUSIC</p><ol start="161"><li>An <em>anthem</em> is a sacred choral composition, usually based on Biblical or liturgical[34] words. It may or may not have an instrumental accompaniment, and is usually written in four parts, but may have five, six, eight, or more.</li></ol><p>[Footnote 34: A <em>liturgy</em> is a prescribed form or method of conducting a religious service, and the parts sung in such a service (as <em>e.g.</em>, the holy communion, baptism, etc.), are referred to as the <em>musical</em> liturgy.]</p><pre><code> The word _anthem_ is derived from _antifona_ (or _antiphona_),

It is a drama set to music.</p><p><em>Grand opera</em> is opera with a serious plot, in which everything is sung, there being no spoken dialog at all.</p><p><em>Opera comique</em> is a species of opera in which part of the dialog is spoken and part sung. <em>Opera comique</em> is not synonymous with <em>comic opera</em>, for the plot of opera comique is as often serious as not. In fact the entire distinction between the terms <em>grand opera</em> and <em>opera comique</em> is being broken down, the latter term referring merely to operas first given at the Opera Comique in Paris, and the former term to those given at the Grand Opera House in the same city.</p><p>A <em>comic opera</em> is a humorous opera, the plot providing many amusing situations and the whole ending happily. It corresponds with the <em>comedy</em> in literature.</p><p>A <em>light opera</em> is one with an exceedingly trivial plot, in which songs, dances, and pretty scenery contribute to the amusement of the audience. The music is lively, but usually as trivial as the plot.</p><p>The term <em>music drama</em> was used by Wagner in referring to his own <em>operas</em>, and is also sometimes applied to other modern <em>operas</em> in which the dramatic element is supposed to predominate over the musical.</p></li><li><p>A <em>libretto</em> (lit.--little book) is the word-text of an opera, oratorio, cantata, or some other similar work.</p></li><li><p><em>Recitative</em> is a style of vocal solo common to operas, oratorios, and cantatas, especially those written some time ago. Its main characteristic is that the word-text is of paramount importance, both rhythm and tone-progression being governed by rhetorical rather than by musical considerations.</p><p><em>Recitative</em> undoubtedly originated in the intoning of the priest in the ritualistic service of the Church, but when applied to the opera it became an important means of securing dramatic effects, especially in situations in which the action of the play moved along rapidly. <em>Recitative</em> is thus seen to be a species of musical declamation.</p><p>In the early examples of <em>recitative</em> there was scarcely any accompaniment, often only one instrument (like the cello) being employed to play a sort of obbligato melody: when full chords were played they were not written out in the score, but were merely indicated in a more or less general way by certain signs and figures. (See &quot;thorough-bass,&quot; p. 85, Sec. 200.)</p><p>But about the middle of the seventeenth century a slightly different style of <em>recitative</em> was invented, and in this type the orchestra was employed much more freely in the accompaniment, especially in the parts between the phrases of the text, but to some extent also to support the voice while singing. This new style was called <em>recitativo stromento</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, accompanied recitative), while the original type was called <em>recitativo secco</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, dry recitative).</p><p>During the last century the style of <em>recitative</em> has been still further developed by Gluck and Wagner, both of whom used the orchestra as an independent entity, with interesting melodies, harmonies and rhythms all its own, while the vocal part is a sort of obbligato to this accompaniment. But even in this latest phase of <em>recitative</em>, it is the word-text that decides the style of both melody and rhythm in the voice part. Fig. 61 shows an example of <em>dry recitative</em>, taken from &quot;The Messiah.&quot;</p><p>[Illustration: ALTO VOICE.

In the <em>aria</em> the word-text is usually entirely subordinate to the melody, and the latter is often very ornate, containing trills, runs, etc.</p></li></ol><p>The rendition of this ornate style of music is often referred to as &quot;coloratura singing,&quot; but it should be noted that not all <em>arias</em> are coloratura in style.</p><pre><code> The familiar solos from The Messiah--&quot;Rejoice Greatly,&quot; and

It will be noted that this &quot;single mood, or sentiment, or picture&quot; was originally conceived by the poet who wrote the word-text, and that the composer in writing music to this text has first tried to get at the thought of the poet, and has then attempted to compose music which would intensify and make more vivid that thought. This intensification of the poet&#39;s thought comes as often through the rhythm, harmony, and dynamics of the accompaniment as through the expressiveness of the voice part.</p><pre><code> The style of song-writing in which each verse is sung to the
 same tune is called the &quot;strophe form,&quot; while that in which

In the earlier <em>ballads</em> each verse of the poem was usually sung to the same tune (strophe form), but in the <em>art-ballad</em> as developed by Loewe and others the continuous style of composition is employed, this giving the composer greater opportunities of making vivid through his music the events described by the poem. These later <em>ballads</em> are in consequence neither &quot;short&quot; nor &quot;simple&quot; but compare in structure with the lied itself.</p></li><li><p>A <em>folk-song</em> is a short song sung by and usually originating among the common people. Its dominant characteristic is usually <em>simplicity</em>, this applying to word-text, melody, and accompaniment (if there is one). The text of the <em>folk-song</em> is usually based on some event connected with ordinary life, but there are also many examples in which historical and legendary happenings are dealt with. Auld Lang Syne, and Comin&#39; thru the Rye, are examples of <em>folk-songs</em>.</p><p>There has been some difference of opinion as to whether a song, the composer of which is known, can ever constitute a real <em>folk-song</em>: recent writers seem to be taking the sensible view of the matter, viz.: that if a song has the characteristics of a folk- rather than an art-song, and if it remains popular for some time among the common people, then it is just as much a <em>folk-song</em> whether the composer happens to be known or not.</p></li><li><p>A <em>madrigal</em> is a secular vocal composition having from three to eight parts. It is in contrapuntal style, like the motet, and is usually sung a capella.</p></li><li><p>A <em>glee</em> is a vocal composition in three or more parts, being usually more simple in style than the madrigal, and sometimes having more than one movement. The <em>glee</em> may be either gay or sad in mood, and seems to be a composition peculiar to the English people.</p></li><li><p>A <em>part-song</em> is a composition for two or more voices, (usually four) to be sung a capella. It is written in monophonic rather than in polyphonic style, thus differing from the madrigal and glee.

In music it is more specifically the regular recurrence of groups of accented and non-accented beats (or pulses)--according to some specified measure-system. Since rhythm implies continuity, there must usually be at least two such measure groups in order to make musical rhythm possible. (See p. 44, Sec. 97.)</p></li><li><p>A <em>melody</em> is a succession of single tones of various pitches so arranged that the effect of the whole will be unified, coherent, and pleasing to the ear.</p><p>The soprano part of hymn-tunes and other simple harmonized compositions is often referred to as &quot;the melody.&quot;</p></li><li><p><em>Harmony</em> is the science of chord construction and combination.</p><p>The term <em>harmony</em> refers to tones sounding simultaneously, <em>i.e.</em>, to <em>chords</em>, as differentiated from tones sounding consecutively, as in melody. The word <em>harmony</em> may therefore be applied to any group of tones of different pitches sounded as a chord, although specifically we usually refer to a <em>succession</em> of such chords when we speak of &quot;harmony.&quot; It is possible to use the same combination of tones in either melody or harmony; in fact these two elements as applied to modern music have developed together and the style of present-day melody is directly based upon the development that has recently taken place in harmonic construction.</p><p><em>Harmony</em> (as contrasted with <em>counterpoint</em>) first began to be an important factor in music about 1600 A.D., <em>i.e.</em>, at the time when opera and oratorio came into existence, when form was established, and when our modern major and minor scales were adopted. Before this practically all music was composed on a contrapuntal basis.</p></li><li><p><em>Timbre</em> is that peculiar quality of sound which enables one to distinguish a tone produced by one instrument (or voice) from a tone produced by an equal number of vibrations on another instrument.</p><p>The word <em>timbre</em> is synonymous with the terms <em>quality of tone</em>, and <em>tone quality</em> (Ger.--Klang-farbe), the excuse for using it being that it expresses adequately in one word an idea that in our language takes at least two: this excuse would disappear (and incidentally a much-mispronounced word would be eliminated) if the single word <em>quality</em> were to be adopted as the equivalent of <em>timbre</em>. Thus, <em>e.g.</em>, the soprano voice singing c&#39; has a <em>quality</em> different from the contralto voice singing the same tone.</p><p>(The remainder of this chapter and all of Chapter XVIII deal with terms commonly encountered in the study of <em>harmony</em>. Courses in this subject usually begin with a study of scales, but since this subject has already been somewhat extensively treated, this chapter will omit it, and will begin with the next topic in harmony study, viz.--the interval.)</p></li><li><p>An <em>interval</em> is the relation of two tones with regard to pitch. If the two tones are sounded simultaneously the result is an <em>harmonic interval</em>, but if sounded consecutively the result is a <em>melodic interval</em>.

Thus the interval C--E is a <em>third</em> because E is the third tone from C (counting C as one) in the diatonic scale. C--G is a <em>fifth</em> because G is the fifth tone above C in the diatonic scale.</p><p>It should be noted however that the same <em>number-names</em> apply even though one or both letters of the interval are qualified by sharps, flats, etc. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, C--G[sharp] is still a <em>fifth</em>, as are also C[sharp]--G[flat] and C[flat]--G[sharp].</p><p>(2) In determining the <em>specific</em> name of any interval (<em>perfect</em> fifth, <em>major</em> third, etc.), the half-step and whole-step (often referred to respectively as <em>minor second</em>, and <em>major second</em>) are used as units of measurement.</p><p>The <em>half-step</em> is usually defined as &quot;the smallest usable interval between two tones.&quot; Thus, C--C[sharp] is a <em>half-step</em>, as are also B--C, F--G[flat], etc.</p><p>A <em>whole-step</em> consists of two half-steps. C--D is a <em>whole-step</em>, as are also B[flat]--C, E--F[sharp], F[sharp]--G[sharp], G[flat]--A[flat], etc.</p><p>The expressions <em>half-step</em> and <em>whole-step</em> are much to be preferred to <em>half-tone</em> and <em>whole-tone</em>, as being more clear and definite.

The simplest chord is the <em>triad</em>, which consists of a fundamental tone called the <em>root</em>, with the third and fifth above it.

C--E[flat]--G[flat].</p><p>An <em>augmented triad</em> has a major third and an augmented fifth, <em>i.e.</em>, it is a major third with another major third on top of it. Ex. C--E--G[sharp].</p></li><li><p>A triad may be built on any scale-tone, but those on I, IV, and V, are used so much oftener than the others that they are often called the <em>common chords</em>. In referring to triads the Roman numerals are used to show on what scale-tone the triad is based, the size of the numeral (with other signs) indicating the kind of triad found on each tone of the scale. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, the large I shows that the triad on the first tone (in major) is a <em>major triad</em>, the small II shows that the triad on the second tone is minor, etc. The following figure will make this clear.</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 65.]</p><p>The triads in the minor scale are as follows:</p><p>[Illustration]</p><ol start="199"><li>A triad is said to be <em>in fundamental position</em> when its root is the lowest tone. It is said to be in the <em>first inversion</em> when the <em>third</em> is the lowest tone, and in the <em>second inversion</em> when the fifth is the lowest tone. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, in Fig. 66 the same chord (C--E--G) is arranged in three different positions, at (a) in fundamental position, at (b) in the first inversion, and at (c) in the second inversion.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: Fig. 66.]</p><ol start="200"><li>When the root is not the bass note, figures are sometimes used to show what chord is to be played or written. Thus, <em>e.g.</em>, the figure 6 over a bass note means that the note given is the <em>third</em> of a chord, the root being found by going up a sixth from the bass note: <em>i.e.</em>, the chord is to be sounded in its first inversion. In the same way the figures 6/4 indicate that the note given is the <em>fifth</em> of the chord, the root and fifth being found by going up a sixth and a fourth from the note given; <em>i.e.</em>, the chord is to be sounded in its second inversion.</li></ol><p>The use of these and other similar figures and signs is called <em>figured bass</em> (or <em>thorough bass</em>) <em>notation</em>. An example of a <em>figured bass</em> is given in Fig. 67.</p><p>[Illustration: Fig. 67.]</p><pre><code> _Thorough bass notation_ was formerly used extensively in
 writing accompaniments to vocal works, the accompanist having

 works the chords have been printed in full and the signs

We have one writer for example asserting that staff notation was begun by drawing a single red line across the page, this line representing the pitch <em>f</em> (fourth line, bass staff), the <em>neumae</em> (the predecessors of our modern <em>notes</em>) standing either for this pitch <em>f</em>, or for a higher or lower pitch, according to their position <em>on</em> the line, or <em>above</em> or <em>below</em> it. &quot;Another line,&quot; continues this writer, &quot;this time of yellow color, was soon added above the red one, and this line was to represent c&#39; (middle C). Soon the colors of these lines were omitted and the <em>letters</em> F and C were placed at the beginning of each of them. From this arose our F and C clefs, which preceded the G clef by some centuries.&quot;[37]</p><p>[Footnote 37: Elson--Music Dictionary, article, &quot;Notation.&quot;]</p><p>Another writer[38] gives a somewhat different explanation, stating that the staff system with the use of clefs came about through writing a letter (C or F) in the margin of the manuscript and drawing a line from this letter to the neume which was to represent the tone for which this particular letter stood.</p><p>[Footnote 38: Goddard--The Rise of Music, p. 177.]</p><p>A third writer[39] asserts that because the alphabetical notation was not suitable for recording melodies because of its inconvenience in sight-singing &quot;points were placed at definite distances above the words and above and below one another.&quot; &quot;In this system ... everything depended on the accuracy with which the points were interspersed, and the scribes, as a guide to the eye, began to scratch a straight line across the page to indicate the position of one particular scale degree from which all the others could be shown by the relative distances of their points. But this was not found sufficiently definite and the scratched line was therefore colored red and a second line was added, colored yellow, indicating the interval of a fifth above the first.&quot;</p><p>[Footnote 39: Williams in Grove&#39;s Dictionary, article, &quot;Notation.&quot;]</p><p>It will be noted that all three writers agree that a certain thing happened, but as in the case of the four Gospels in the New Testament, not all the writers agree on details and it is difficult to determine which account is most nearly accurate in detail as well as in general statement. Communication was much slower a thousand years ago than now and ideas about new methods of doing things did not spread rapidly, consequently it is entirely possible that various men or groups of men in various places worked out a system of notation differing somewhat in details of origin and development but alike in final result. The point is that the development of musical knowledge (rise of part-writing, increased interest in instrumental music, etc.), demanded a more exact system of notation than had previously existed, just as the development of science in the nineteenth century necessitated a more accurate scientific nomenclature, and in both cases the need gave rise to the result as we have it to-day.</p><p>Out of the chaos of conflicting statements regarding the development of music notation, the student may glean an outline-knowledge of three fairly distinct periods or stages, each of these stages being intimately bound up with the development of <em>music</em> itself in that period. These three stages are:</p><pre><code> (1) The Greek system, which used the letters of the alphabet
 for representing fixed pitches.

 (2) The period of the neumae.

 (3) The period of staff notation.
</code></pre><p>Of the Greek system little is known beyond the fact that the letters of the alphabet were used to represent pitches. This method was probably accurate enough, but it was cumbersome, and did not afford any means of writing &quot;measured music&quot; nor did it give the eye any opportunity of grasping the general outline of the melody in its progression upward and downward, as staff notation does. The Greek system seems to have been abandoned at some time preceding the fifth century. At any rate it was about this time that certain <em>accent marks</em> began to be written above the text of the Latin hymns of the church, these marks serving to indicate in a general way the progress of the melody. E.g., an upward stroke of the pen indicated a rise of the melody, a downward stroke a fall, etc. In the course of two or three centuries these marks were added to and modified quite considerably, and the system of notation which thus grew up was called &quot;neume notation,&quot; the word <em>neume</em> (sometimes spelled <em>neuma</em>, or <em>pneuma</em>) being of Greek origin and meaning a <em>nod</em> or <em>sign</em>.</p><p>This system of neumes was in some ways a retrogression from the Greek letter system, for the neumes indicated neither definite pitches nor definite tone-lengths. But it had this advantage over the Greek system, that the position of the signs on the page indicated graphically to the eye the general direction of the melody, as well as giving at least a hint concerning the relative highness or lowness of each individual tone (the so-called <em>diastematic system</em>), and this was a great aid to the eye in singing, just as the relative highness and lowness of notes on the modern staff is of great value in reading music at the present time. Thus although the neumae did not enable one to sing a new melody at sight as our modern staff notation does, yet they served very well to recall to the eye the general outline of a melody previously learned by ear and therefore enabled the singer (the system was used for vocal music only) to differentiate between that particular melody and the dozens of others which he probably knew. Neume notation was used mostly in connection with the &quot;plain-song melodies&quot; of the Church, and since the words of these chants were sung as they would be pronounced in reading, the deficiency of the neume system in not expressing definite duration values was not felt. But later on with the rise of so-called &quot;measured music&quot; (cf. invention of opera, development of independent instrumental music, etc.), this lack was seen to be one of the chief disadvantages of the system.</p><p>The elements of neume-writing as given by Riemann in his Dictionary of Music are:</p><p>&quot;(1) The signs for a single note: Virga (Virgula) and Punctus (Punctum). (2) The sign for a rising interval: Pes (Podatus). (3) The sign for a falling interval: Clinis (Flexa). (4) Some signs for special manners of performance: Tremula (Bebung), Quilisma (shake), Plica (turn), etc. The others were either synonyms of the above-named or combinations of them....&quot;</p><p>Since music in the middle ages was always copied by hand, it will readily be understood that these neumae were not uniform either in shape or size, and that each writer made use of certain peculiarities of writing, which, although perfectly intelligible to himself, could not readily be interpreted by others (cf. writing shorthand). Here then we observe the greatest weakness of the neume system--its lack of uniformity and its consequent inability accurately to express musical ideas for universal interpretation.</p><pre><code> Examples of several neumes are given merely in order to give
 the beginner a general idea of their appearance.

 Virga [virga symbol] or [virga symbol]. Punctus [punctus
 symbol] or [punctus symbol]. Pes [pes symbol] or [pes symbol].
 Clinis [clinis symbol] or [clinis symbol].
</code></pre><p>As music grew more and more complex, and especially as writing in several parts came into use (cf. rise of organum, descant, and counterpoint), it became increasingly difficult to express musical ideas on the basis of the old notation, and numerous attempts were made to invent a more accurate and usable system. Among these one of the most interesting was that in which the words of the text were written in the spaces between long, parallel lines, placing the initial letters of the words <em>tone</em> and <em>semi-tone</em> at the beginning of the line to indicate the scale interval. An example will make this clear.</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p>This indicated the precise melodic interval but did not give any idea of the rhythm, and the natural accents of the text were the only guide the singer had in this direction, as was the case in neume-notation and in early staff-notation also. Various other attempts to invent a more definite notation were made, but all were sporadic, and it was not until the idea of using the lines (later lines and spaces) to represent definite pitches, and writing notes of various shapes (derived from the neumae) to indicate relative duration-values--it was only when this combination of two elements was devised that any one system began to be universally used.</p><p>Just how the transition from <em>neume</em> to <em>staff</em> notation was made no one knows: it was not done in a day nor in a year but was the result of a gradual process of evolution and improvement. Nor is it probable that any one man deserves the entire credit for the invention of staff notation, although this feat is commonly attributed to an Italian monk named Guido d&#39;Arezzo (approximate dates 995-1050). To this same monk we are indebted, however, for the invention of the syllables (UT, RE, MI, etc.) which (in a somewhat modified form) are so widely used for sight-singing purposes. (For a more detailed account of the transition to staff notation, see Grove, op. cit. article <em>notation</em>.) It will now be readily seen that our modern notation is the result of a combination of two preceding methods (the Greek letters, and the neumes) together with a new element--the staff, emphasizing the idea that <em>higher tones</em> are written <em>higher</em> on the staff than lower ones. The development of the neumes into notes of various shapes indicating relative time values and the division of the staff into measures with a definite measure signature at the beginning are natural developments of the earlier primitive idea. In the system of &quot;musica mensurabilis&quot; or <em>measured music</em> which was inaugurated a little later, the <em>virga</em> (which had meanwhile developed into a square-headed neume) was adopted as the <em>longa</em> or long note, and the punctus in two of its forms as <em>breve</em> and <em>semi-breve</em> (short and half-short). The longa is now extinct, but the modern form of the breve is still used as the double-whole-note, and the semi-breve is our modern whole-note.</p><p>Red-colored notes were sometimes used to indicate changes in value and before long outline notes (called <em>empty notes</em>) came into use, these being easier to make than the solid ones. The transition from square- and diamond-shaped notes to round and oval ones also came about because of the greater facility with which the latter could be written, and for the same reason notes of small denomination were later &quot;tied together&quot; or <em>stroked</em>. This latter usage began about 1700 A.D.</p><p>It is interesting to find that when &quot;measured music&quot; was finally inaugurated there were at first but two measure-signatures, viz.--the circle, standing for three-beat measure (the so-called <em>perfect measure</em>) and the semi-circle (or broken circle) which indicated two-beat measure. Occasionally three-beat measure was indicated by three vertical strokes at the beginning of the melody, while two-beat measure was shown by two such strokes. Upon the basis of these two varieties of measure, primitive in conception though they may have been, has been built nevertheless the whole system now employed, and in the last analysis all forms of measure now in use will be found to be of either the two-beat or the three-beat variety. The circle has disappeared entirely as a measure-sign, but the broken circle still survives, and from it are derived the familiar signs [common-time symbol] and [cut-time symbol], which are sometimes erroneously referred to as being the initial letter of our word <em>common</em> (as used in the expression &quot;common time&quot;). The transition from the older style of measure-signature to the present one seems to have occurred during the century following the invention of opera, <em>i.e.</em>, from about 1600 to about 1700 A.D.</p><p>The rest came into use very soon after &quot;measured music&quot; began to be composed and we soon find rests corresponding with the various denominations of notes in use, viz.:</p><p>[Illustration]</p><p>The terms applied to these rests vary in different authorities, but it will be noted that the <em>pausa</em>, <em>semi-pausa</em>, and <em>suspirum</em> correspond respectively to the double-whole-rest, whole-rest, and half-rest in use at present.</p><p>The bar and double bar may be developments of the <em>maxima rest</em> (as some writers suggest) but are probably also derived from the practice of drawing a line vertically through the various parts of a score to show which notes belonged together, thus facilitating score reading. The bar may occasionally be found as early as 1500, but was not employed universally until 1650 or later.</p><p>The number of lines used in the staff has varied greatly since the time of Guido, there having been all the way from four to fifteen at various times and in various places, (<em>four</em> being the standard number for a long time). These lines (when there were quite a number in the staff) were often divided into <em>groups of four</em> by <em>red</em> lines, which were not themselves used for notes. These red lines were gradually omitted and the staff divided into sections by a space, as in modern usage. The number of lines in each section was changed to five (in some cases six) for the sake of having a larger available range in each section.</p><p>The clefs at the beginning of the staffs are of course simply altered forms of the letters F, C, and G, which were written at first by Guido and others to make the old neume notation more definite.</p><p>The staccato sign seems not to have appeared until about the time of Bach, the legato sign being also invented at about the same time. The fermata was first used in imitative part-writing to show where each part was to stop, but with the development of harmonic writing the present practice was inaugurated. Leger lines came into use in the seventeenth century.</p><p>Sharps and flats were invented because composers found it necessary to use other tones than those that could be represented by the staff degrees in their natural condition. The history of their origin and development is somewhat complicated and cannot be given here, but it should be noted once more that it was the need of expressing more than could be expressed by the older symbols that called forth the newer and more comprehensive method. The use of sharps and flats in key signatures grew up early in the seventeenth century. In the earlier signatures it was customary to duplicate sharps or flats on staff degrees having the same pitch-name, thus: [Illustration] [Illustration]. (The use of the G clef as here shown did not of course exist at that time.)</p><p>The double-sharp and double-flat became necessary when &quot;equal temperament&quot; (making possible the use of the complete cycle of keys) was adopted. This was in the time of Bach (1685-1750).</p><p>Signs of expression (relating to tempo and dynamics) date back at least as far as the year 1000 A.D., but the modern terms used for this purpose did not appear until some years after the invention of opera, the date given by C.F.A. Williams in Grove&#39;s Dictionary being 1638. These words and signs of expression were at first used only in connection with instrumental music, but were gradually applied to vocal music also.</p><p>Other systems of notation have been invented from time to time in the course of the last two or three centuries, but in most cases they have died with their inventors, and in no case has any such system been accepted with anything even approaching unanimity. The tonic-sol-fa system[40] is used quite extensively in England for vocal music, but has gained little ground anywhere else and the chances are that the present system of notation, with possibly slight additions and modifications, will remain the standard notation for some time to come in spite of the attacks that are periodically made upon it on the ground of cumbersomeness, difficulty in teaching children, etc. The main characteristics of staff notation may be summed up as follows:</p><p>[Footnote 40: The <em>tonic-sol-fa system</em> represents an attempt to invent a simpler notation to be used by beginners, (especially in the lower grades of the public schools) and by singers in choral societies who have never learned to interpret staff notation and who therefore find some simpler scheme of notation necessary if they are to read music at all.</p><p>In this system the syllables <em>do</em>, <em>re</em>, <em>mi</em>, etc., (in phonetic spelling) are used, the tone being arrived at in each case, first by means of a firmly established sense of tonality, and second by associating each diatonic tone with some universally felt emotional feeling: thus <em>do</em> is referred to as the <em>strong</em> tone, <em>mi</em> as the <em>calm</em> one, and <em>la</em> as the <em>sad</em> tone, great emphasis being placed upon <em>do</em> as the center of the major tonality, and upon <em>la</em> as the center of the minor. The system is thus seen to have one advantage over staff notation, viz.: that in presenting it <em>the teacher is compelled to begin with a presentation of actual tones</em>, while in many cases the teacher of staff notation begins by presenting facts regarding the staff and other symbols before the pupil knows anything about tone and rhythm as such.</p><p>The symbol for each diatonic tone is the initial letter of the syllable (<em>i.e.</em>, d for <em>do</em>, r for <em>re</em>, etc.), the key being indicated by a letter at the beginning of the composition. The duration-value of tones is indicated by a system of bars, dots, and spaces, the bar being used to indicate the strongest pulse of each measure (as in staff notation) the beats being shown by the mark: a dash indicating the continuation of the same tone through another beat. If a beat has two tones this is indicated by writing the two initial letters representing them with a . between them. A modulation is indicated by giving the new key letter and by printing the syllable-initials from the standpoint of both the old and the new <em>do</em>-position. The figure &#39; above and to the right of the letter indicates the tone in the octave above, while the same figure below and to the right indicates the octave below. A blank space indicates a rest. The tune of My Country, &#39;Tis of Thee, as printed in tonic sol-fa notation below will make these points clear.</p><p>Key F</p><p>|d :d :r |t_1 :-.d :r |m :m :f |m :-.r :d |r :d :t_1 |d :-- :-- | |s 😒 😒 |s :-.f :m |f :f :f |f :-.m :r |m :f.m :r.d |m :-.f 😒 | |l.f:m :r |d :-- :-- |</p><p>The advantages of the system are (1) the strong sense of key-feeling aroused and the ease with which modulations are felt; and (2) the fact that it is necessary to learn to sing in but one key, thus making sight-singing a much simpler matter, and transposition the easiest process imaginable. But these are advantages from the standpoint of the vocalist (producing but one tone at a time) only, and do not apply to instrumental music. The scheme will therefore probably be always restricted to vocal music and will hardly come into very extensive use even in this field, for the teacher of music is finding it perfectly possible to improve methods of presentation to such an extent that learning to sing from the staff becomes a very simple matter even to the young child. And even though this were not true, the tonic-sol-fa will always be hampered by the fact that since all letters are printed in a straight horizontal line the ear does not have the assistance of the eye in appreciating the rise and fall of melody, as is the case in staff notation.]</p><pre><code> 1.

</code></pre><p>APPENDIX B</p><p>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</p><ol><li><p>Broadly speaking, musical instruments may be divided into two classes, viz.: (1) those that have a keyboard and are therefore capable of sounding several tones simultaneously; (2) those that (as a rule) sound only one tone at a time, as the violin and trumpet. The piano is of course the most familiar example of the first class, and a brief description is therefore given.</p><p>The <em>piano</em> was invented about two hundred years ago by Cristofori (1651-1731), an Italian. It was an enormous improvement over the types of keyboard instrument that were in use at that time (clavichord, harpsichord, spinet, virginal) and has resulted in an entirely different style of composition. See note on embellishments, p. 26.</p></li><li><p>The most characteristic things about the <em>piano</em> as contrasted with its immediate predecessors are: (1) that on it the loudness and softness of the tone can be regulated by the force with which the keys are struck (hence the name <em>pianoforte</em> meaning literally the <em>soft-loud</em>); (2) the fact that the piano is capable of sustaining tone to a much greater extent than its predecessors. In other words the tone continues sounding for some little time after the key is struck, while on the earlier instruments it stopped almost instantly after being sounded.</p></li></ol><p>The essentials of the piano mechanism are:</p><pre><code> 1. Felt hammers controlled by keys, each hammer striking two
 or three strings (which are tuned in unison) and immediately
 rebounding from these strings, allowing them to vibrate as
 long as the key is held down. The mechanism that allows the
 hammers to rebound from the strings and fall into position for
 another blow is called the _escapement_.

 2. A damper (made of softer felt) pressing against each string
 and preventing it from vibrating until it is wanted.

 3. A keyboard action that controls both hammers and dampers,
 causing the damper to leave the string at the same instant
 that the hammer strikes it.

 4. A pedal (damper pedal) controlling all of the dampers, so
 that at any moment all the strings may be released so as to be
 free to vibrate.
</code></pre><p>Other interesting details are:</p><pre><code> 1. The strings are stretched over a thin sheet of wood called
 the sound-board. This aids greatly in intensifying the tone.

 2. The soft pedal (the one at the left) in an _upright piano_
 causes the hammers to move up nearer the strings, and the
 shorter swing thus afforded causes a less violent blow and
 consequently a softer tone. In the _grand piano_ this same
 pedal shifts the mechanism to one side so that the hammers
 strike only one or two of the strings, this resulting in a
 softer tone of somewhat modified quality.
</code></pre><p>These details regarding the mechanism of the piano can easily be verified by removing the front of any ordinary upright piano and observing what takes place when the keys are struck or the pedals depressed.</p><ol start="3"><li>There are two familiar types of <em>organ</em> in use at the present time, (1) the reed organ, (2) the pipe-organ.</li></ol><p>The <em>reed organ</em> is very simple in construction, the tone being produced by the vibration of metal reeds (fixed in little cells), through which air is forced (or sucked) from the bellows, the latter being usually worked by the feet of the player. More power may be secured either by drawing additional stops, thus throwing on more sets of reeds, or by opening the knee swells which either throw on more reeds (sometimes octave couplers) or else open a <em>swell box</em> in which some of the reeds are enclosed, the tone being louder when the box is open than when closed. More tone may also be secured by pumping harder.</p><ol start="4"><li>The essential characteristic of the <em>pipe-organ</em> is a number of sets or registers of pipes called <em>stops</em>, each set being capable (usually) of sounding the entire chromatic scale through a range of five or six octaves. Thus for example when the stop <em>melodia</em> is drawn (by pulling out a stop-knob or tilting a tablet), one set of pipes only, sounds when the keyboard is played on: but if the stop <em>flute</em> is drawn with <em>melodia</em>, two pipes speak every time a key is depressed. Thus if an organ has forty <em>speaking stops</em>, all running through the entire keyboard, then each time one key is depressed forty pipes will speak, and if a chord of five tones is played, two hundred pipes will speak. The object of having so many pipes is not merely to make possible a very powerful tone, but, rather, to give greater variety of tone-color.</li></ol><p>The pipe-organ usually has a pedal keyboard on which the feet of the performer play a bass part, this part often sounding an octave (or more) lower than the notes indicate.</p><p>An <em>eight-foot stop</em> on the organ produces tones of the same pitches as the piano when corresponding keys are struck: A <em>four-foot stop</em> sounds tones an octave higher and a <em>two-foot stop</em> tones two octaves higher. A <em>sixteen-foot stop</em> sounds tones an octave lower than the piano, and a <em>thirty-two foot</em> stop, tones two octaves lower, while some organs have also a <em>sixty-four foot</em> stop which sounds three octaves lower. This gives the organ an exceedingly wide range, its compass being greater than that of any other single instrument, and comparable in both range of pitches and variety of color only with the modern orchestra.</p><p>Modern pipe-organs always have a number of <em>combination pedals</em> or <em>pistons</em> (usually both), by means of which the organist is enabled to throw on a number of stops with one movement. The selection and use of suitable stops, couplers, combinations, etc., is called <em>registration</em>.</p><ol start="5"><li><p>The instruments mentioned at the beginning of this appendix as belonging to the second class are more familiar in connection with ensemble playing, being commonly associated with either band or orchestra.</p></li><li><p>A <em>band</em> is a company of musicians all of whom play upon either wind or percussion instruments, the main body of tone being produced by the brass and wood-wind divisions.</p><p>Sousa&#39;s band is usually made up in somewhat the following manner: 4 flutes and piccolos, 12 B[flat] clarinets, 1 E[flat] clarinet, 1 alto clarinet, 1 bass clarinet, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 sarrusophones, 4 saxophones, 4 cornets, 2 trumpets, 1 soprano saxhorn (fluegelhorn), 4 French horns, 4 trombones, 2 contra-bass tubas, 4 tubas, 1 snare drum, 1 bass drum, 2 kettle drums, cymbals, triangle, bells, castanets, xylophone, etc.</p></li><li><p>An <em>orchestra</em> is a company of musicians performing upon stringed instruments as well as upon wind and percussion. It is differentiated from the band by the fact that the main body of tone is produced by the strings.</p></li></ol><p>There are <em>four classes of instruments</em> in the orchestra, viz., <em>strings</em>, <em>wood-wind</em>, <em>brass</em> (<em>wind</em>) and <em>percussion</em>. In addition to these four classes, there is the <em>harp</em>, which although a stringed instrument, does not belong in the same group as the other strings because the manner of producing the tone is altogether different.</p><ol start="8"><li><p>In the first group (the <em>strings</em>) are found the first and second violins, viola, violoncello (usually spelled <em>cello</em>), and double-bass. The first and second violins are identical in every way (but play different parts), while the other members of the family merely represent larger examples of the same type of instrument.</p></li><li><p>In the second group (the <em>wood-wind</em>) are found the flute, piccolo, oboe, bassoon, English horn, double-bassoon, clarinet, and bass clarinet. The English horn, double-bassoon, bass clarinet, and piccolo are not called for in the older compositions, hence are not always present in the orchestra.</p></li><li><p>In the third group (the <em>brass choir</em>) are found the French horn, (usually referred to as <em>the horn</em>), trumpet (sometimes replaced by the cornet) trombone, and tuba.</p></li><li><p>The fourth group (<em>percussion</em>) consists of kettle drums, bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, triangle, bells, etc.</p></li><li><p>In an orchestra of about 100 players the proportion of instruments is as about as follows, although it varies somewhat according to the taste of the conductor, the style of composition to be performed, etc.:</p></li></ol><p>18 first violins, 16 second violins, 14 violas, 12 cellos, 10 basses, 1 harp, 3 flutes, 1 piccolo, 3 oboes, 1 English horn, 3 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, 1 contra (or double) bassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, 3 kettle drums, 1 bass drum, 1 snare drum, 1 each of triangle, cymbals, bells, and other instruments of percussion, several of which are often manipulated by one performer.</p><ol start="13"><li><p>The cuts and brief descriptions here added will give at least a rudimentary idea of the appearance and possibilities of the instruments most commonly used in bands and orchestras. For fuller descriptions and particulars regarding range, quality, etc., the student is referred to Mason&#39;s &quot;The Orchestral Instruments and What They Do,&quot; Lavignac&#39;s &quot;Music and Musicians,&quot; and to the various articles which describe each instrument under its own name in Grove&#39;s Dictionary or in any good encyclopaedia. For still fuller details some work on orchestration will have to be consulted.</p></li><li><p>The <em>violin</em> has four strings, tuned thus [Illustration: g d&#39; a&#39; e&#39;&#39;], these making available a range of about three and one-half octaves (g--c&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;). This range[41] may be extended upward somewhat further by means of <em>harmonics</em>, these being produced by lightly touching the string at certain points (while the bow is moving across it) instead of holding it down against the finger-board. The highest string of the <em>violin</em> (viola and cello also) is often called the <em>chanterelle</em> because it is most often used for playing the melody. The <em>violin</em> ordinarily produces but one tone at a time, but by <em>stopping</em> two strings simultaneously and so drawing the bow as to set both in vibration, two tones may be produced at the same time, while three and four tones can be sounded <em>almost</em> simultaneously.</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 41: The ranges noted in connection with these descriptions of instruments are ordinarily the <em>practical orchestral or band</em> ranges rather than those which are possible in solo performance.]</p><p>[Illustration: VIOLIN. Length, 23-1/2 inches. Length of bow, 29-1/2 inches.]</p><p>The <em>mute</em> (or <em>sordino</em>) is a small clamp made of metal, wood, or ivory, which when clipped to the top of the bridge causes the vibrations to be transmitted less freely to the body of the violin, giving rise to a tone modified in quality, and decreased in power.</p><p>For certain special effects the player is directed to pluck the string (<em>pizzicato</em>), this method of playing giving rise to a dry, detached tone instead of the smooth, flowing one that is so characteristic of the <em>violin</em> as commonly played.</p><p><em>Violins</em> in the orchestra are divided into firsts and seconds, the <em>first violins</em> being always seated at the left of the audience and the <em>seconds</em> at the right.</p><p>[Illustration: VIOLA. Length, 26 in. Length of bow, 28.]</p><ol start="15"><li>The <em>viola</em> has four strings, also tuned in fifths, thus [Illustration: c g d&#39; a&#39;]. The <em>viola</em> looks exactly like the violin at a little distance, and is really only a larger sized violin, having a range a fifth lower. Its tone is not so incisive as that of the violin, being rather heavier--&quot;more gloomy,&quot; as it is often described. The <em>viola</em> is not so useful as the violin as a solo instrument because it is not capable of producing so many varieties of color, nevertheless it is invaluable for certain effects. In orchestral music it is of course one of the most valuable instruments for filling in the harmony. The <em>viola</em> players are usually seated behind the second violin players in the orchestra.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: VIOLONCELLO. Length, 3 ft. 10 in. Length of bow, 28 in.]</p><ol start="16"><li><p>The <em>violoncello</em> or <em>cello</em> (sometimes called <em>bass viol</em>) has four strings, tuned thus: [Illustration: C G d a]. Its range is about three and one-half octaves (from C to e&#39;&#39; or f&#39;&#39;), but in solo work this range is sometimes extended much higher. The <em>cello</em> is much more universally used as a solo instrument than the viola and its tone is capable of a much greater degree of variation. In the orchestra it plays the bass of the string quartet (reinforced by the double-bass), but is also often used for solo passages. <em>Con sordino</em> and <em>pizzicato</em> passages occur as often for the <em>cello</em> as for the violin.</p></li><li><p>The <em>double bass</em> differs from the other members of the string family in that it is tuned in <em>fourths</em> instead of in <em>fifths</em>. Its four strings are tuned as follows [Illustration: EE AA D G] the entire range of the instrument being from EE to a. In music written for double-bass the notes are always printed an octave higher than the tones are to sound: that is, when the bass-player sees the note [Illustration: c] he plays [Illustration: C] this being done to avoid leger lines. The tone of the <em>bass</em> is much heavier and the instrument itself is much more clumsy to handle than the other members of the group, hence it is almost never used as a solo instrument but it is invaluable for reinforcing the bass part in orchestral music. The mute is rarely used on the <em>double-bass</em>, but the <em>pizzicato</em> effect is very common and the bass pizzicato tone is much fuller and richer than that of any other stringed instrument.</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: DOUBLE-BASS. Length, 6 ft. 6 in. Length of bow, 23-1/2 in.]</p><ol start="18"><li><p>The <em>flute</em> has a range of three octaves. [Illustration: c&#39; c&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;] It is used in both solo and orchestral playing as well as in bands. The flute was formerly always made of wood, but is at present often made of metal.</p></li><li><p>The <em>piccolo</em> is a flute playing an octave higher than the one described above. The notes are printed as for the flute, but the player understands that the tone is to sound an octave higher. The <em>piccolo</em> is used widely in band music and quite often in orchestral music also, but since the tone is so brilliant and penetrating and is incapable of any great variation, it is not suitable for solo performance.</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: OBOE.

The tone in these instruments is produced by the vibration of two very thin pieces of cane, which are called together a <em>double-reed</em>.</li></ol><p>The <em>oboe</em> is especially valuable in the orchestra as a solo instrument, and its thin, nasal tones are suggestive of rustic, pastoral simplicity, both <em>oboe</em> and <em>English horn</em> being often used by orchestral composers in passages intended to express the idea of rural out-of-door life. The <em>English horn</em> is also often used in passages where the idea of melancholy and suffering is to be conveyed to the audience. In a military band the oboe corresponds to the first violin of the orchestra.</p><p>The <em>bassoon</em> and <em>contra-bassoon</em> are used mostly to provide a bass part for the harmony of the wood-wind group, but they are also sometimes employed (especially the <em>bassoon</em>) to depict comic or grotesque effects.</p><p>[Illustration: BASS CLARINET. Length, 3 ft. 3 in. Range D to b-flat&#39;]</p><p>[Illustration: CLARINET. Length 28 in.]</p><ol start="21"><li>The next two types of instruments to be described (<em>clarinet</em> and <em>saxophone</em>) are alike in that the tone is produced by the vibration of a <em>single</em> strip of cane (called <em>single reed</em>) which is held against the lower lip of the player. The <em>clarinet</em> and <em>bass clarinet</em> are made of wood and are used in both bands and orchestras, but the <em>saxophone</em> is usually made of metal, and, the tone being more strident and penetrating, the instrument is ordinarily used only in combination with other wind instruments, <em>i.e.</em>, in bands.</li></ol><p>Since the fingering of the <em>clarinet</em> is excessively difficult the performer can play in only certain keys on the same instrument, hence to play in different keys <em>clarinets</em> in several keys must be provided, there being usually three in all. The music is written as though it were to be played in the key of C, but the tones produced are actually in other keys. For this reason the <em>clarinet</em> is called a <em>transposing instrument</em>. The range of the <em>clarinet</em> is the greatest possessed by any of the wind instruments, that of the clarinet in C being from [Illustration: e] to [Illustration: g&#39;&#39;&#39;].</p><p>[Illustration: SAXOPHONES.</p><p>SOPRANO.

It is made of brass and exists in several sizes, the only one ever used in the orchestra being the double-bass <em>sarrusophone</em>, which has approximately the same range as the double-bassoon and is sometimes (but rarely) made use of in the orchestra instead of the latter instrument. The tone of the <em>sarrusophone</em> is something like that of the bassoon.</p><p>[Illustration: FRENCH HORN. Length, 22-3/4 in.]</p><ol start="22"><li>The <em>French horn</em> (often called <em>valve horn</em> or simply <em>horn</em>) really consists of a long tube (about 16 feet) which is bent into circular form for convenience in handling. Its range is from [Illustration: BB] to [Illustration: f&#39;&#39;]. In the orchestra <em>French horns</em> are used in pairs, two of the players taking the higher tones, and two the lower. The tone is intensely mellow but incapable of any extensive variation, but in spite of this lack of variety the tone itself is so wonderfully beautiful that the instrument is one of the most useful in the orchestra both in solo passages and to fill in the harmony. The <em>horn</em> (as well as the trumpet and trombone) differs from most of the wood-wind instruments in that its mouthpiece contains no reed, the lips of the player constituting the vibrating body as they are stretched across the mouthpiece and air is forced against them. The <em>horn</em> is used in bands as well as in orchestras.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: TRUMPET. Length, 22-1/2 in.]</p><ol start="23"><li><p>The range of the <em>trumpet</em> is [Illustration: g b&#39;&#39;], the typical tone being brilliant and ringing. It is used in both band and orchestra, playing the highest parts assigned to the brass choir. The <em>trumpet</em> is often replaced in both band and orchestra by its less refined cousin the <em>cornet</em> because of the ease with which the latter can be played as compared with the trumpet, and the larger number of players that are available in consequence of this ease of execution.</p></li><li><p>The <em>cornet</em> looks something like the trumpet, but is not so slim and graceful in appearance. Its tube is only four and one-half feet long, as compared with a length of about eight feet in the trumpet, and sixteen feet in the French horn.</p></li></ol><p>The range of the <em>cornet</em> in B[flat] is from [Illustration: e] to [Illustration: b-flat&#39;&#39;]. The tone is somewhat commonplace as compared with the trumpet, but because of its great agility in the rendition of trills, repeated tones, etc., it is universally used in all sorts of combinations, even (as noted above) taking the place of the trumpet in many small orchestras.</p><p>[Illustration: CORNET.

Range of tenor trombone (the size ordinarily used) E to b-flat&#39;]</p><ol start="25"><li><p>The pitch sounded by the <em>trombone</em> is altered by lengthening or shortening the tube of which the instrument is constructed, this being possible because the lower part slides into the upper and can be pulled out to increase the total length of the tube through which the air passes. There are usually three <em>trombones</em> in the orchestra, each playing a separate part, and the combination of this trio (with the <em>tuba</em> reinforcing the bass part) is majestic and thrilling, being powerful enough to dominate the entire orchestra in <em>Fortissimo</em> passages. But the <em>trombones</em> are useful in soft passages also, and their tone when playing pianissimo is rich, serene, and sonorous.</p></li><li><p>The <em>bass tuba</em> is a member of the saxhorn family[42] and supplies the lowest part of the brass choir, as the double-bass does in the string choir. It is used in both orchestra and band, being often supported in the larger bands by a still lower-toned member of the same family--the <em>contra-bass tuba</em>. The range of the <em>tuba</em> is from [Illustration: GG] to [Illustration: g&#39;].</p></li></ol><p>[Footnote 42: The <em>saxhorn</em> was invented about 1840 by Adolphe Sax, a Frenchman.

The size of these instruments varies somewhat with the make, but when two drums are used the diameter is approximately that given under the illustration. The range of a pair of <em>drums</em> is <em>one octave</em> [Illustration: F f] and when but two drums are used the larger one takes the tones from F to about C of this range, and the smaller takes those from about B[flat] to F. The most common usage is to tune one drum to the <em>tonic</em>, and the other to <em>the dominant</em> of the key in which the composition is written. The pitch of the <em>kettle-drum</em> can be varied by increasing or lessening the tension of the head by means of thumb-screws which act on a metal ring.</li></ol><p>[Illustration: KETTLE-DRUMS.

Its range is from [Illustration: CC-flat] to [Illustration: f-flat&#39;&#39;&#39;].</li></ol><p>[Illustration: HARP. Height, 5 ft. 8 in.]</p><p>The modern <em>double-action harp</em> has forty-six strings, which are tuned in half-steps and whole-steps so as to sound the scale of C[flat] major. It has a series of seven pedals around its base, each pedal having two <em>notches</em> below it, into either of which the pedal may be lowered and held fast. The first pedal shortens the F[flat] string so that it now sounds F, (giving the key of G[flat]); the second one shortens the C[flat] string so that it sounds C (giving the key of D[flat]); the third pedal shortens the G[flat] string so that it sounds G (giving the key of A[flat]); the fourth changes D[flat] to D (giving the key of E[flat]), and so on until, when all the pedals are fixed in their first notches, the scale of C is sounded instead of C[flat] as was the case before any of the pedals were depressed. But if the first pedal is now pushed down into the second notch the original F[flat] string is still further shortened and now sounds the pitch F[sharp] (giving us the key of G), and if all the other pedals are likewise successively lowered to the second notch we get in turn all the <em>sharp keys</em>--D, A, E, B, F[sharp] and C[sharp], the last-named key being obtained as the result of having all the pedals fixed in their second notches, thus making all the tones of the original C[flat] scale a whole-step higher so that they now sound the C[sharp] scale.</p><p>Chords of not more than four tones for each hand may be played simultaneously on the harp, but arpeggio and scale passages are the rule, and are more successful than simultaneous chords. The notation of harp music is essentially like that of piano music.</p><p>APPENDIX C</p><p>ACOUSTICS</p><pre><code> NOTE:--It is usually taken for granted that the student of
 music is familiar with the significance of such terms as
 _over-tone_, _equal temperament_, etc., and with principles
 such as that relating to the relation between vibration rates
 and pitches: the writer has in his own experience found,
 however, that most students are not at all familiar with such
 data, and this appendix is therefore added in the hope that a
 few facts at least regarding the laws of sound may be brought
 to the attention of some who would otherwise remain in entire
 ignorance of the subject.
</code></pre><ol><li><p><em>Acoustics</em> is the science which deals with sound and the laws of its production and transmission. Since all sound is caused by vibration, <em>acoustics</em> may be defined as the science which treats of the phenomena of sound-producing vibration.</p></li><li><p>All sound (as stated above) is produced by vibration of some sort: strike a tuning-fork against the top of a table and <em>see</em> the vibrations which cause the tone, or, if the fork is a small one and the vibrations cannot be seen, hold it against the edge of a sheet of paper and hear the blows it strikes; or, watch one of the lowest strings of the piano after striking the key a sharp blow; or, look closely at the heavier strings of the violin (or better still, the cello) and watch them oscillate rapidly to and fro as the bow moves across them.</p></li></ol><p>The vibrating body may be a string, a thin piece of wood, a piece of metal, a membrane (cf. drum), the lips (cf. playing the cornet), the vocal cords, etc. Often it is a column of air whose vibrations give rise to the tone, the reed or other medium merely serving to set the air in vibration.</p><ol start="3"><li>Sound is <em>transmitted</em> through the air in somewhat this fashion: the vibrating body (a string for example) strikes the air-particles in its immediate vicinity, and they, being in contact with other such air-particles, strike these others, the latter in turn striking yet others, and so on, both a forward and backward movement being set up (oscillation). These particles lie so close together that no movement at all can be detected, and it is only when the disturbance finally reaches the air-particles that are in contact with the ear-drum that any effect is evident.</li></ol><p>This phenomenon of sound-transmission may perhaps be made more clear by the old illustration of a series of eight billiard balls in a row on a table: if the first ball is tapped lightly, striking gently against ball number 2, the latter (as well as numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) will not apparently move at all, but ball number 8 at the other end will roll away. The air-particles act upon each other in much this same fashion, the difference being that when they are set in motion by a vibrating body a complete vibration backward and forward causes a similar <em>backward and forward</em> movement of the particles (oscillation) instead of simply a <em>forward jerk</em> as in the case of the billiard balls.</p><p>Another way of describing the same process is this: the vibration of some body produces waves in the air (cf. waves in the ocean, which carry water forward but do not themselves move on continuously), these waves spread out spherically (i.e. in all directions) and finally reach the ear, where they set the ear-drum in vibration, thus sending certain sound-stimuli to the nerves of hearing in the inner ear, and thus to the brain.</p><p>An important thing to be noted in connection with sound-transmission is that sound will not travel in a vacuum: some kind of a medium is essential for its transmission. This medium may be air, water, a bar of iron or steel, the earth, etc.</p><ol start="4"><li><p>The <em>rate</em> at which sound travels through the air is about 1100 feet per second, the rapidity varying somewhat with fluctuations in temperature and humidity. In water the rate is much higher than in air (about four times as great) while the velocity of sound through other mediums (as <em>e.g.</em>, steel) is sometimes as much as sixteen times as great as through air.</p></li><li><p>Sound, like light, may be <em>intensified</em> by a suitable reflecting surface directly back of the vibrating body (cf. sounding board); it may also be reflected by some surface at a distance from its source in such a way that at a certain point (the focus) the sound may be very clearly heard, but at other places, even those <em>nearer</em> the source of sound, it can scarcely be heard at all. If there is such a surface in an auditorium (as often occurs) there will be a certain point where everything can be heard very easily, but in the rest of the room it may be very difficult to understand what is being said or sung.</p></li></ol><p><em>Echoes</em> are caused by sound-reflection, the distance of the reflecting surface from the vibrating body determining the number of syllables that will be echoed.</p><p>The <em>acoustics</em> of an auditorium (<em>i.e.</em>, its hearing properties) depend upon the position and nature of the reflecting surfaces and also upon the length of time a sound persists after the vibrating body has stopped. If it persists longer than 2-1/4 or 2-1/3 seconds the room will not be suitable for musical performances because of the mixture of persisting tones with following ones, this causing a blurred effect somewhat like that obtained by playing a series of unrelated chords on the piano while the damper-pedal is held down. The duration of the reverberation depends upon the size and height of the room, material of floor and walls, furniture, size of audience, etc.</p><ol start="6"><li><p>Sound may be classified roughly into <em>tones</em> and <em>noises</em> although the line of cleavage is not always sharply drawn. If I throw stones at the side of a barn, sounds are produced, but they are caused by irregular vibrations of an irregularly constructed surface and are referred to as <em>noise</em>. But if I tap the head of a kettle-drum, a regular series of vibrations is set up and the resulting sound is referred to as <em>tone</em>. In general the material of music consists of tones, but for special effects certain noises are also utilized (cf. castanets, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Musical tones have three properties, viz.:</p><ol><li><p>Pitch.</p></li><li><p>Intensity.</p></li><li><p>Quality (timbre).</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>By <em>pitch</em> is meant the highness or lowness of tone. It depends upon rate of vibration. If a body vibrates only 8 or 10 times per second no tone is heard at all: but if it vibrates regularly at the rate of 16 or 18 per second a tone of very low pitch is heard. If it vibrates at the rate of 24 the pitch is higher, at 30 higher still, at 200 yet higher, and when a rate of about 38,000 per second has been reached the pitch is so high that most ears cannot perceive it at all. The highest tone that can ordinarily be heard is the E[flat] four octaves higher than the highest E[flat] of the piano. The entire range of sound humanly audible is therefore about eleven octaves (rates 16-38,000), but only about <em>eight</em> of these octaves are utilized for musical purposes. The tones of the piano (with a range of 7-1/3 octaves) are produced by vibration rates approximately between 27 and 4224. In the orchestra the range is slightly more extended, the rates being from 33 to 4752.</p><p>Certain interesting facts regarding the relation between vibration-rates and pitches have been worked out: it has been discovered for instance that if the number of vibrations is doubled, the pitch of the resulting tone is an octave higher; <em>i.e.</em>, if a string vibrating at the rate of 261 per second gives rise to the pitch c&#39;, then a string one-half as long and vibrating twice as rapidly (522) will give rise to the pitch c&#39;&#39;, <em>i.e.</em>, an octave higher than c&#39;. In the same way it has been found that if the rate is multiplied by 5/4 the pitch of the tone will be a <em>major third</em> higher; if multiplied by 3/2, a <em>perfect fifth</em> higher, etc. These laws are often stated thus: the ratio of the octave to the fundamental is as two is to one; that of the major third as five is to four; that of the perfect fifth as three is to two, and so on through the entire series of pitches embraced within the octave, the <em>ratio</em> being of course the same for all octaves.</p><ol start="9"><li>The <em>intensity</em> (loudness or softness) of tones depends upon the amplitude (width) of the vibrations, a louder tone being the result of vibrations of greater amplitude, and vice versa. This may be verified by plucking a long string (on cello or double-bass) and noting that when plucked gently vibrations of small amplitude are set up, while a vigorous pluck results in much wider vibrations, and, consequently, in a louder tone. It should be noted that the <em>pitch</em> of the tone is not affected by the change in amplitude of vibration.</li></ol><p>The intensity of tones varies with the medium conveying them, being usually louder at night because the air is then more elastic. Tone intensity is also affected by <em>sympathetic vibrations</em> set up in other bodies. If two strings of the same length are stretched side by side and one set in vibration so as to produce tone the other will soon begin to vibrate also and the combined tone will be louder than if only one string produced it. This phenomenon is the basis of what is known as resonance (cf. body of violin, resonance cavities of nose and mouth, sounding board of piano, etc.).</p><ol start="10"><li><p><em>Quality</em> depends upon the shape (or form) of the vibrations which give rise to the tone. A series of simple vibrations will cause a simple (or colorless) tone, while complex vibrations (giving rise to overtones of various kinds and in a variety of proportions) cause more individualistic peculiarities of quality. Quality is affected also by the shape and size of the resonance body. (Cf. last part of sec. 9 above.)</p></li><li><p>Practically every musical tone really consists of a combination of several tones sounding simultaneously, the combined effect upon the ear giving the impression of a single tone. The most important tone of the series is the <em>fundamental</em>, which dominates the combination and gives the pitch, but this fundamental is practically always combined with a greater or less number of faint and elusive attending tones called <em>overtones</em> or <em>harmonics</em>. The first of these overtones is the octave above the fundamental; the second is the fifth above this octave; the third, two octaves above the fundamental, and so on through the series as shown in the figure below. The presence of these <em>overtones</em> is accounted for by the fact that the string (or other vibrating body) does not merely vibrate in its entirety but has in addition to the principal oscillation a number of sectional movements also. Thus it is easily proved that a string vibrates in halves, thirds, etc., in addition to the principal vibration of the entire string, and it is the vibration of these halves, thirds, etc., which gives rise to the <em>harmonics</em>, or <em>upper partials</em> as they are often called. The figure shows <em>Great C</em> and its first eight overtones. A similar series might be worked out from any other fundamental.</p></li></ol><p>[Illustration: (NOTE:--The B[flat] in this series is approximate only.)]</p><p>It will be recalled that in the section (10) dealing with <em>quality</em> the statement was made that <em>quality</em> depends upon the shape of the vibrations; it should now be noted that it is the form of these vibrations that determines the nature and proportion of the overtones and hence the quality. Thus <em>e.g.</em>, a tone that has too large a proportion of the fourth upper partial (<em>i.e.</em>, the <em>third</em> of the chord) will be <em>reedy</em> and somewhat unpleasant. This is the case with many voices that are referred to as <em>nasal</em>. Too great a proportion of overtones is what causes certain pianos to sound &quot;tin-panny.&quot; The tone produced by a good tuning-fork is almost entirely free from overtones: it has therefore no distinctive quality and is said to be a <em>simple</em> tone. The characteristic tone of the oboe on the other hand has many overtones and is therefore highly individualistic: this enables us to recognize the tone of the instrument even though we cannot see the player. Such a tone is said to be <em>complex</em>.</p><ol start="12"><li><p>The mathematical ratio referred to on page 134, if strictly carried out in tuning a keyboard instrument would cause the half-steps to vary slightly in size, and playing in certain keys (especially those having a number of sharps or flats in the signature) would therefore sound out of tune. There would be many other disadvantages in such a system, notably the inability to modulate freely to other keys, and since modulation is one of the predominant and most striking characteristics of modern music, this would constitute a serious barrier to advances in composition. To obviate these disadvantages a system of <em>equal temperament</em> was invented and has been in universal use since the time of Bach (1685-1750) who was the first prominent composer to use it extensively. <em>Equal temperament</em> means simply dividing the octave into twelve equal parts, thus causing all scales (as played on keyboard instruments at least) to sound exactly alike.</p><p>To show the practicability of equal temperament Bach wrote a series of 48 <em>preludes and fugues</em>, two in each major and two in each minor key. He called the collection &quot;The Well-tempered Clavichord.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Various <em>standards of pitch</em> have existed at different times in the last two centuries, and even now there is no absolute uniformity although conditions are much better than they were even twenty-five years ago. Scientists use what is known as the &quot;scientific standard&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;philosophic standard&quot;), viz., 256 double vibrations for &quot;middle C.&quot; This pitch is not in actual use for musical purposes, but is retained for theoretical purposes because of its convenience of computation (being a power of 2). In 1885 a conference of musicians at Vienna ratified the pitch giving Middle C 261 vibrations, this having been adopted by the French as their official pitch some 26 years before. In 1891 a convention of piano manufacturers at Philadelphia adopted this same pitch for the United States, and it has been in practically universal use ever since. This pitch (giving Middle C 261 vibrations) is known as &quot;International Pitch.&quot;</p></li></ol><p><em>Concert pitch</em> is slightly higher than <em>International</em>, the difference between the two varying somewhat, but being almost always less than one-half step. This higher pitch is still often used by bands and sometimes by orchestras to give greater brilliancy to the wind instruments.</p><pre><code> REFERENCES

</code></pre><p>APPENDIX D</p><p>TERMINOLOGY REFORM</p><p>A recent writer[43] on <em>vocal terminology</em> makes the following statement as an introduction to certain remarks advocating a more definite use of terms relating to tone production by the human voice:--&quot;The correct use of words is the most potent factor in the development of the thinker.&quot; If this statement has any basis of fact whatsoever to support it then it must be evident to the merest novice in musical work that the popular use of many common terms by musicians is keeping a good many people from clear and logical thought in a field that needs accurate thinkers very badly! However this may be, it must be patent to all that our present terminology is in many respects neither correct nor logical, and the movement inaugurated by the Music Section of the National Education Association some years ago to secure greater uniformity in the use and definition of certain expressions should therefore not only command the respect and commendation, but the active support of all progressive teachers of music.</p><p>[Footnote 43: Floyd S. Muckey--&quot;Vocal Terminology,&quot; <em>The Musician</em>, May, 1912, p. 337.]</p><p>Let it be noted at the outset that such reforms as are advocated by the committee will never come into general use while the rank and file of teachers throughout the country merely <em>approve</em> the reports so carefully compiled and submitted each year: these reforms will become effective only as individual teachers make up their minds that the end to be attained is worth the trouble of being careful to use only correct terminology every day for a month, or three months, or a year--whatever length of time may be necessary in order to get the new habits fixed in mind and muscle.</p><p>The Terminology Committee was appointed by the Department of Music of the N.E.A. in 1906 and made its first report at Los Angeles in 1907. Since then the indefatigable chairman of the committee (Mr. Chas. I. Rice, of Worcester, Mass.) has contributed generously of both time and strength, and has by his annual reports to the Department set many of us to thinking along certain new lines, and has caused some of us at any rate to adopt in our own teaching certain changes of terminology which have enabled us to make our work more effective.</p><p>In his first report Mr. Rice says:</p><p>&quot;Any one who has observed the teaching of school music in any considerable number of places in this country cannot fail to have remarked the great diversity of statement employed by different teachers regarding the facts which we are engaged in teaching, and the equal diversity of terminology used in teaching the symbols by which musicians seek to record these facts. To the teacher of exact sciences our picturesque use of the same term to describe two or more entirely different things never ceases to be a marvel.... Thoughtful men and women will become impressed with the untruthfulness of certain statements and little by little change their practice. Others will follow, influenced by example. The revolutionists will deride us for not moving faster while the conservatives will be suspicious of any change.&quot;</p><p>At this meeting in Los Angeles a list of thirteen points was recommended by the committee and adopted by the Music Department.

Some of the points recommended have usually been rejected by the Department, but many of them have been adopted and the reports of the committee have set many teachers thinking and have made us all more careful in the use and definition of common terms.

 1. _Tone:_ Specific name for a musical sound of definite
 pitch. Use neither _sound_, a general term, nor _note_, a term
 of notation.

 2. _Interval:_ The pitch relation between _two_ tones. Not
 properly applicable to a single tone or scale degree. Example:
 &quot;Sing the fifth tone of the scale.&quot; Not &quot;sing the fifth
 interval of the scale.&quot;

 3. _Key:_ Tones in relation to a tonic. Example: In the key of
 G. _Not_ in the scale of G. Scales, major and minor are
 composed of a definite selection from the many tones of the
 key, and all scales extend through at least one octave of
 pitch. The chromatic scale utilizes all the tones of a key
 within the octave.

 4. _Natural:_ Not a suitable compound to use in naming
 pitches. Pitch names are either _simple_: B, or _compound_: B
 sharp, B double-sharp, B flat or B double-flat, and there is
 no pitch named &quot;B natural.&quot; Example: Pitch B, _not_ &quot;B
 natural.&quot;

 NOTE:--L.R.L. thinks that B natural should be the name when
 the notation suggests it.

 5. _Step, Half-step:_ Terms of interval _measurement_. Avoid
 _tone_, _semi-tone_ or _half-tone_. Major second and minor
 second are interval _names_. Example: How large are the
 following intervals? (1) Major second, (2) minor second, (3)
 augmented prime. Answer: (1) a step, (2) a half-step, (3) a
 half-step.

 6. _Chromatic:_ A tone of the key which is not a member of its
 diatonic scale. (N.B.) An accidental (a notation sign) is not
 a chromatic sign _unless_ it makes a staff-degree represent a
 chromatic tone.

 7. _Major; Minor:_ Major and Minor keys having the same
 signature should be called relative major and minor. Major and
 minor keys having the same tonic, but different signatures,
 should be called tonic major and minor. Not &quot;parallel&quot; major
 or minor in either case.

 8. _Staff:_ Five horizontal lines and their spaces. Staff
 _lines_ are named (numbered) upward in order, first to fifth.
 _Spaces:_ Space below, first-second-third-fourth-space, and
 space above[44]. (Six in all.) Additional short lines and
 their short spaces numbered outward both ways from the main
 staff, viz: line below, second space below. The boundary of
 the staff is always a space.

 [Footnote 44: NOTE:--Not &quot;space below the staff&quot; or &quot;space
 above the staff.&quot;]

 9. _G Clef, F Clef, C Clef:_ These clefs when placed upon the
 staff, give its degrees their first, or primary pitch meaning.
 Each makes the degree it occupies represent a pitch of its
 respective name. Example: The G clef makes the second line
 represent the pitch G. Avoid &quot;_fixes G on_.&quot; The staff with
 clef in position represents only pitches having _simple_ or
 _one-word_ names, A, B, C, etc.

 10. _Sharps, Flats:_ Given a staff with clef in position as in
 example above, sharps and flats make staff degrees upon which
 they are placed represent pitches a half-step higher or lower.
 These pitches have compound or two-word names. Example: The
 second line stands for the pitch G (simple name). Sharp the
 second line and it will stand for the pitch G sharp. (Compound
 name.) The third line stands for the pitch B. (Simple name.)
 Flat it, and the line will stand for the pitch B flat.
 (Compound name.) N.B. These signs do not &quot;_raise_&quot; or
 &quot;_lower_&quot; notes, tones, pitches, letters or staff degrees.

 11. _Double-sharp, Double-flat:_ Given a staff with three or
 more degrees sharped in the signature, double-sharps are used
 (subject to the rules governing composition) to make certain
 of these degrees, already sharped, represent pitches one
 half-step higher yet. Similarly, when three or more degrees
 are flatted in the signature, double-flats are used to make
 certain degrees already flatted, represent pitches one
 half-step lower yet. Examples: To represent sharp 2 in the key
 of B major, double-sharp the C degree, or (equally good)
 double-sharp the third space (G clef). To represent flat 6 in
 the key of D flat major, double-flat the B degree, or (equally
 good) double flat the third line (G clef). _Do not say_: &quot;Put
 a double-sharp on 6&quot; or &quot;put a double-sharp on C,&quot; or
 &quot;_indicate&quot;_ a higher or lower pitch &quot;_on_&quot; a sharped or
 flatted degree.

 12. _Signature:_ Sharps or flats used as signatures affect the
 staff degrees they occupy and all octaves of the same.
 Example: With signature of four sharps, the first one affects
 the fifth line and the first space; the second, the third
 space; the third, the space above and the second line; the
 fourth, the fourth line and the space below. _Do not say_: &quot;F
 and C are sharped,&quot; &quot;ti is sharped,&quot; &quot;B is flatted,&quot; &quot;fa is
 flatted.&quot; &quot;Sharpened&quot; or &quot;flattened&quot; are undesirable.

 13. _Brace:_ The two or more staffs containing parts to be
 sounded together; also the vertical line or bracket connecting
 such staffs. _Not_ &quot;line&quot; or &quot;score.&quot; &quot;Staff&quot; is better than
 &quot;line&quot; for a single staff, and &quot;score&quot; is used meaning the
 book containing an entire work, as &quot;vocal score,&quot; &quot;orchestral
 score,&quot; &quot;full score.&quot;

 14. _Notes:_ Notes are characters designed to represent
 relative duration. When placed on staff-degrees they
 _indicate_ pitch. (Note the difference between &quot;represent&quot; and
 &quot;indicate.&quot;) &quot;Sing what the note calls for&quot; means, sing a tone
 of the pitch represented by the staff degree occupied by the
 note-head. The answer to the question: &quot;What is that note?&quot;
 would be &quot;half-note,&quot; &quot;eighth-note&quot; according to the
 denomination of the note in question, whether it was on or off
 the staff.

 15. _Measure-sign:_ 4-4, 2-4, 6-8, are _measure-signs_. Avoid
 &quot;time signatures,&quot; &quot;meter-signatures,&quot; &quot;the fraction,&quot;
 &quot;time-marks.&quot; Example: What is the measure-sign? (C) Ans. A
 broken circle. What is its meaning? Ans. Four-quarter measure.
 (Not four-four time, four-four rhythm, four-four meter.)

 16. _Note Placing:_ Place a quarter note on the fourth line.
 Not &quot;put a quarter note on D.&quot;

 17. _Beat-Pulse:_ A tone or rest occurs on a certain beat or
 pulse of a measure. Not on a certain _count_.

 18. _Signature Terminology:_ The right hand sharp in the
 signature is on the staff degree that represents seven of the
 major scale. Not &quot;always on 7 or ti.&quot;

 19. _Signature Terminology:_ The right hand flat in the
 signature is on the staff degree that represents four of the
 major scale. Not &quot;always on fa.&quot;

 20. _Rote, Note, Syllable:_ Singing by rote means that the
 singer sings something learned by ear without regard to notes.
 Singing by note means that the singer is guided to the correct
 pitch by visible notes. Singing by syllable means that the
 singer sings the tones of a song or part to the sol-fa
 syllables instead of to words, neutral vowels or the hum.
 &quot;Sing by note&quot; is not correct if the direction means simply to
 sing the sol-fa syllables, whether in sight reading, rote
 singing, or memory work. &quot;Sing by syllable&quot; would be correct
 in each case.


 ADOPTIONS OF THE 1911 MEETING AT SAN FRANCISCO

 Arabic numerals, either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 12, placed on the
 staff directly after the signature and above the third line,
 show the number of beats in a measure.

 A note, either a quarter or a dotted quarter, placed in
 parenthesis under the numeral, represents the length of one
 beat and is called the beat-note.

 The numeral and the beat-note thus grouped constitute the
 measure-sign.

 Illustrative statements covering proper terminology: the tune
 &quot;America&quot; is written in three-quarter measure. The chorus:
 &quot;How lovely are the Messengers&quot; is written in two-dotted
 quarter measure.

 The above forms of statement were adopted at Denver in 1909,
 and are recommended for general use when speaking of music
 written with the conventional measure-signs, etc.

 In place of: &quot;two-two time, three-eight time, four-four time,&quot;
 say as above: &quot;This piece is written in two-half measure,
 three-eighth measure, four-quarter measure.&quot;

 ADOPTIONS OF THE 1912 MEETING AT CHICAGO

 _Pulse and Beat_

 The Committee finds that the words: Pulse and Beat are in
 general use as synonymous terms, meaning one of the succession
 of throbs or impulses of which we are conscious when listening
 to music. Each of these pulses or beats has an exact point of
 beginning, a duration, and an exact point of ending, the
 latter coincident with the beginning of the next pulse or
 beat. When thus used, both words are terms of ear.

 _Beat_

 One of these words, Beat, is also in universal use, meaning
 one of a series of physical motions by means of which a
 conductor holds his group of performers to a uniform movement.

 When thus used it becomes a term of eye.

 The conductor&#39;s baton, if it is to be authoritative, cannot
 wander about through the whole duration of the pulse but must
 move quickly to a point of comparative repose, remaining until
 just before the arrival of the next pulse when it again makes
 a rapid swing, finishing coincidently with the initial tone
 (or silence) of the new pulse.

 Thus it is practically the end of the conductor&#39;s beat that
 marks the beginning of the pulse.

 The Committee is of opinion that Beat might preferably be used
 as indicating the outward sign.

 _Beat-Note_

 This term &quot;beat-note&quot; is already in use in another important
 connection (see Terminology Report, 1911) and the Committee
 recommends that those using the above terms shall say: &quot;This
 note is an on-the-beat note; this one is an after-the-beat
 note; this one a before-the-beat note.&quot;


 DEFINITIONS

 _Matters of Ear_

 Pulse: The unit of movement in music, one of a series of
 regularly recurring throbs or impulses.

 Measure: A group of pulses.

 Pulse-Group: Two or more tones grouped within the pulse.

 _Matters of Eye_

 Beat: One of a series of conventional movements made by the
 conductor. This might include any unconventional motion which
 served to mark the movement of the music, whether made by
 conductor, performer or auditor.

 Beat-Note: A note of the denomination indicated by the
 measure-sign as the unit of note-value in a given measure.

 _Example_

 Given the following measure-signs: 2-4, 2-2, 2-8, quarter,
 half, or eighth notes, respectively, are beat-notes.

 Beat-Group: A group of notes or notes and rests, of smaller
 denomination than the beat-note which represents a full beat
 from beginning to end and is equal in value to the beat-note.
 (A beat-group may begin with a rest.)

 On-the-Beat Note (or rest): Any note (or rest) ranging in
 value from a full beat down, which calls for musical action
 (or inaction) synchronously with the conductor&#39;s beat.

 After-the-Beat Note: Any note in a beat-group which indicates
 that a tone is to be sounded after the beginning, and before
 or at the middle of the pulse.

 Before-the-Beat Note: Any note in a beat-group which indicates
 that a tone is to be sounded after the middle of the pulse.

 To illustrate terminology and to differentiate between Pulse
 and Beat as terms, respectively of ear and eye, the following
 is submitted:

 Whenever a brief tone involves the musical idea of
 syncopation, it may be regarded as an after-the-pulse tone and
 the note that calls for it as an after-the-beat note; when it
 involves the idea of anticipation or preparation it may be
 regarded as a before-the-pulse tone, and the note that calls
 for it, as a before-the-beat note.

 _Measure and Meter_

 &quot;What is the measure-sign?&quot;

 &quot;What is the meter-signature?&quot;

 These two words are used synonymously, and one of them is
 unnecessary. The Committee recommends that Measure be retained
 and used. Meter has its use in connection with hymns.

</code></pre><p>The author does not find it possible at present to agree with all the recommendations made in the above report, but the summary is printed in full for the sake of completeness.</p><p>The Music Teacher&#39;s National Association has also interested itself mildly in the subject of terminology reform, and at its meeting in Washington, D.C., in 1908, Professor Waldo S. Pratt gave his address as president of the Association on the subject &quot;System and Precision in Musical Speech.&quot; This address interested the members of the Association to such an extent that Professor Pratt was asked to act as a committee whose purpose it should be to look into the matter of reforms necessary in music terminology and report at a later session. In 1910 Professor Pratt read a report in which he advocated the idea of making some changes in music nomenclature, but took the ground that the subject is too comprehensive to be mastered in the short time that can be given to it by a committee, and that it is therefore impossible to recommend specific changes. He also took occasion to remark that one difficulty in the whole matter of terminology is that many terms and expressions are used <em>colloquially</em> and that such use although usually not scientific, is often not distinctly harmful and is not of sufficient importance to cause undue excitement on the part of reformers. Quoting from the report at this point:--&quot;A great deal of confusion is more apparent than real between <em>note</em> and <em>tone</em>, between <em>step</em> and <em>degree</em>, between <em>key</em> and <em>tonality</em>. No practical harm is done by speaking of the <em>first note</em> of a piece when really <em>first tone</em> would be more accurate. To say that a piece is written <em>in the key of B[flat]</em> is more convenient than to say that it is written in the <em>tonality of which B[flat] is the tonic</em>. The truth is that some of the niceties of expression upon which insistence is occasionally laid are merely fussy, not because they have not some sort of reason, but because they fail to take into account the practical difference between colloquial or off-hand speech and the diction of a scientific treatise. This is said without forgetting that colloquialism always needs watching and that some people form the habit of being careless or positively uncouth as if it were a mark of high artistic genius.&quot;</p><p>Professor Pratt&#39;s report is thus seen to be philosophic rather than constructive, and terminology reform will undoubtedly make more immediate progress through the efforts of the N.E.A. Committee with its specific recommendations (even though these are sometimes admittedly <em>fussy</em>) than through the policy of the M.T.N.A. of waiting for some one to get time to take up the subject in a scholarly way. Nevertheless the philosophic view is sometimes badly needed, especially when the spirit of reform becomes too rabid and attaches too great importance to trifles. A judicious intermingling of the two committees in a series of joint meetings would undoubtedly result in mutual helpfulness, and possibly also in a more tangible and convincing statement of principles than has yet been formulated by either.</p><p>APPENDIX E</p><p>Sonata Op. 31, No. 3 by Beethoven</p><p>Analysis by ARTHUR E.
